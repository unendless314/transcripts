    I'm going to have to clean the blood doesn't work, then I've got probably a few more months to make it before my kidneys
    shut down. So that's kind of why I'm kind of going along with the interview at this time.

  source_text: What year would this be? 1958. I went through the signal training course. And at that time, I went through
    the radio tele-type course and also the cryptography course, Crypto. They had five instructors that were getting out of
    military service, so they pulled the top five students. And I was third in the class, so I got pulled as an instructor.

    And I said, "Well, money is good." So he explained to me that I could -- he could put it through, like, would have to
    get a top secret White House cue clearance for the job, you know. And I thought, boy, must be a pretty exclusive thing,
    you know. And I said, "Well, what is this?" And he said that I'm director for the CIA for eastern United States, you know.
    And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that." And he said, "You weren't supposed to."

  source_text: After about six weeks, my security clearance came through, and I got my CIA card. It was an ID card, like a
    credit card, where I could just go up to the door and slice it, walk right in. And my name at that time, I used an artificial
    name, too. Never used my real name. I started working with him on the project he was on. And that was Project Blue Book,
    which was kind of partially a fraud.

    about a certain sighting that they had in Mexico or Italy or something like that. And then we had people that would follow
    through on it, that would go out and interview the people to see if they were not cases, or if it was real, you know.

  source_text: I wasn't, but I always stayed statewide. But the people we had working with us from CIA would do that. We would
    get like a new report probably a couple times a week. I was coming into the Army fresh off the farm, you know, so I really
    didn't have much knowledge of anything. But my boss filled me in on Project Blue Book and what they had found so far,
    as far as the Greys and the aliens and the Roswell Incident.

    called the people in from MJ-12, from Area 51 and S-4, but they told us that the government had no jurisdiction over what
    they were doing. So being a general, past general, you didn't tell them to go to hell without any real good reason, you
    know.

    the film, he took on a role, highly classified, working for the CIA, and his boss was reporting to Langley from reports
    that were coming into Fort Belvoir. He described to me in great detail the autopsy footage that he had seen of nonhumans
    describing the unusual brains and the unusual internal organs, and the fact that they were screening film disguised as
    being on a southeastern military base, and that the film that they were screening on a regular basis was coming from around
    the world. He had seen film from Italy in which

    that would be normal in the normal nine-to-five world, and when I returned to my home then in Philadelphia, I remember
    going to the phone and voicemail, and the last thing that we had agreed upon was that I would return in approximately

    car when we came out of the supermarket, and they said, 'We want to remind you that you have been a loyal American, and
    we are here to tell you that you are never to talk with Linda Moulton Howe again or to discuss this subject.'" None of
    those 11 hours of my audio tapes would have been in the phone calls, so it means that they were listening to our three
    days and three nights in the house, and I promised him from that point on that I would never discuss him or the material,
    and in fact, later on, I received information from someone unknown that he was dead. So I am personally gratified to see
    that he made a statement today for this citizen hearing

    of astonishing sightings we have on the one hand and the lack of responsible treatment of this by our major media, also
    our academic and our scientific institutions and indeed our political system. This is a shame because there's very good
    research that's being done every day. Many of those researchers have been here this week. Others are out there too such
    as the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, NARCAP, which was referenced in the previous panel by
    Jim Courant. They collect and analyze encounters that the aviation industry has had with unknown objects. There are thousands
    of such cases.

  source_text: There are outstanding web search websites such as ufoevidence.org. There are also many excellent research groups
    in Europe and elsewhere in the world. None of them get any love from America's dumbed-down media, which prefers to lump
    the whole subject into a big tinfoil hat and instead write about the latest escapades of Kim Kardashian. This is a symptom.
    It's a symptom of a deeper problem. To understand why there is a truth embargo, we need to come to terms with the fact
    that America's major media groups lost their independence a long time ago. We all know about media consolidation. We all
    know about the intimate relationships that have existed for years between the elite members in the corporate media empire
    and the political leadership and particularly with the military and intelligence community.

  source_text: Last year, one example only, it was learned that the Pentagon spends some $4 billion a year to sway public
    opinion. Now, aside from asking just why Americans ought to be paying their own government to brainwash them, I mean,
    talk about getting shafted both ways, right? This is just one facet of many that highlight a revolving door through which
    passes the military industrial complex, the media, the academic community and more. National security money, which is
    our nation's greatest and most egregious waste of all, has infiltrated everything and that certainly means the once-upon-a-time
    integrity of our journalists and media corporations.

    this not obvious by now? Now, why would they do this? Well, many reasons.

    from point A to point B. Whatever powers, flying saucers, it's something different, something better. So if the President
    were to announce the reality of these things, how long do you think it would take before scientists openly begin to study
    the nature of the propulsion and power system of UFOs? This would immediately challenge oil, not simply as the world's
    leading source of power, but it would severely threaten the entire global financial system, which is based upon oil. And
    probably 90 percent of the value of any product you can think of is determined by the energy that went into making and
    transporting it, and in most cases that means oil. To say nothing of the millions of jobs that rely on the petroleum industry.

    of alien technology and perhaps bodies. In fact, there are a number of well-researched UFO crash events. So suppose for
    a moment that it happened. That would mean that the cover-up involves much more than mere knowledge of other beings here
    on planet Earth. It would mean there is possession of such advanced technology as to be nearly incomprehensible at least
    at first. Hard to consider, and yet an inevitable conclusion. So what happens when teams of brilliant scientists with

    enough time and effort, even if they couldn't replicate what they found, they might have learned a few things. Some such

    state electronics, fiber optics, high tensile fibers, lasers, and an array of other money-making opportunities for the
    defense and other industries. None of this has been proven, but it is also true that the private research undertaken in
    classified environments is not easy for outside researchers to observe. In fact, it would be very easy to hide the Roswell
    connection in the historical treatment of these and other technologies. Another relevant consideration of such breakthroughs
    is that they would reduce to zero any incentive to reveal the secret

    deal about UFOs and told me that he had spoken to 18 former presidents, CIA directors, and DOD secretaries about UFOs
    after their retirement. Their attitudes fell into three categories. One group, roughly three or four of them, said essentially,
    "What's wrong with you? Why waste your time with that nonsense?" Another equally small group made it clear that they had
    been briefed on the matter and knew that it was serious. But the largest group, at least half of all of the individuals
    who had been at the pinnacle of power, had said, "You know about UFOs? I would love to know about that, but got nowhere.

    Recall the words of the late Senator Daniel Inouye from 1987, "There exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force,
    its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of national interests, free from
    all checks and balances, and free from the law itself." He was on to something.

    degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1961. His military career was spent over the span of
    20 years. Dad served as a fighter pilot, flying the F-86D, and according to him, the best airplane ever made, as well
    as the F-100. He was a decorated pilot, achieving the title of USAF command pilot. Dad flew over 300 combat missions in
    Vietnam as a forward air controller in Vietnam. He received 13 air medals, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, and
    I know firsthand that he was even put in for the Air Force Cross, which he denied because of political reasons, which
    we'll not get into here. My father attained a rank of major, as well as during his career he also worked with NASA as
    a chief of range control for the Gemini and Apollo Moon missions.

    And I've never seen my father cry until this story broke. Sadly, my father kept it all from everyone, including us and
    my family. Not even telling his father's story when he was the closest man that he ever had. I know Dad would never have

  source_text: He then realized that this was no drill. They normally would never give you an authentication code, and they
    told him it was a hot mission. He had orders to shoot this thing down. Dad told me whatever this thing was, they wanted
    it down, and he thought he was starting World War III. All kinds of thoughts were in his head. The intercept controller
    ordered Dad to fire a full salvo of 24 rockets at this object. Dad later told me that he knew full well how serious this
    event was. Dad was in his aircraft. His aircraft came to life, and he was given an order to go gate, which meant full
    afterburners were to be used after getting airborne. Dad said, "Do you want me to continue with the afterburners? Affirmative.
    Go gate."

  source_text: Dad said this thing was huge, and the blip was so big that it was easy to get target acquisition. Right before
    he got the instruction to fire from the radar control set, the target made an erratic side-to-side movement and moved
    beyond range, causing Dad to lose lock on his target. The object then accelerated from zero to Mach 10 in seconds, and
    Dad was unable to fire as a result. He lost complete lock. Dad told me his radar, his wingman's radar and the ground radar
    confirmed it as well. They had lost lock, and they were totally perplexed as to what happened. So, to make a long story
    short, the most compelling thing Dad said was that this thing was doing things that an ordinary aircraft could do. It
    was defying the laws of physics, and he was convinced that it was of alien origin. Anyhow, during that time, there was
    nothing in the Air Force that could come close to it. The F-86 could

    There was no known aircraft that could do this. So, upon landing his aircraft, Dad was contacted by the intercept officer
    on a secure phone. The person on the line told him that what happened was considered classified, and not to discuss this
    with anyone, from his wingman to his commander. He would be debriefed in the morning. Dad told me he realized how lucky
    he was, as if he did manage to fire at this object, he probably would have vaporized him. Off the record, he was scared
    shitless. So, he did tell me that the following day, Dad reported for duty, a call came in from a man that was from the
    NSA, and that he called him a spook. For us, it was much more personal, this whole event, because the spook came in, and
    swore Dad to secrecy that he would never, ever repeat what

  source_text: Mr. Dolan, is there a way to put together people? For example, we've heard a lot over the last four and a half
    days about the number of pilots who have seen other kinds of vehicles that are not from the United States or from this
    world flying. Is there a way to get some of these pilots together? Are they willing to talk about what they saw? Do you
    know?

  source_text: Thank you for the question. First of all, I would just repeat the name of the organization I mentioned earlier
    in my statement, NARCAP, which is the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomenon. I mention them because
    they are very rigorous, very scientific, very low key, very nonsensational, and deal precisely with these individuals
    that you're talking about and have done so for decades. There have been a number of cases in which we've had pilots go
    on the record. In fact, there's no lack of very good data and information out there. The problem is, unfortunately, that
    these individuals who are all sober and careful and, as you heard in the previous panel, still get ridiculed by the media.
    They get the tinfoil hat placed on them. This is something that none of us have found a way to get around that, no matter
    how rigorous we are. In my own work years ago when I started

    trust pilots. Rightfully or wrongfully, they trust pilots. They're the most logical group who fly all the time. We are
    back and forth across this country, across this world, that as they see what they've seen, it seems to me that there would
    be some validity. I mean, the public would accept that premise if enough of them got together and talked about it.

    in one of my four books and he had been exposed to it but because everything is so compartmentalized on a need to know
    basis, he came to me as a reporter and it goes to the heart of what he said. He said, "My job when I was working for the
    Defense Intelligence Agency was to study and monitor the geopolitical territorial conflicts of three extraterrestrial
    biological entities who have been involved with this planet for at least 270 million years." He broke them down as blonde-haired,
    blue-eyed that we would not distinguish from the so-called archangels of history. The second group would be standing up
    reptoids and the third group would be a huge variety of what are called grays.

  source_text: I would add, if I may, that research has pointed out even a greater variety than this. Depending on how you
    deal with abduction research, there is some of this that's fairly extensive. They would talk about insectoid-type creatures.
    And then let's not forget there are a large number of individuals who have had or claim to have, sometimes I think persuasively
    to be honest with you, some form of contact with other beings that is not physical. This is a very difficult subject to
    get one's hand on, but these stories do not go away. Who are these beings? Are they good, bad, and different to our fate
    is another issue we can discuss. In terms of interrelationships, you're asking exactly the kind of question that many
    researchers still would like to get to the bottom of.

  source_text: Yes, thank you. Jeffrey Torres, I was very interested in your testimony. You said something and I think I know
    what you meant, but you didn't exactly say it this way, so I'm going to ask you if this is what you meant. It's kind of
    a yes or no question. You said that what your father witnessed in terms of the maneuverability of a particular object
    defied the law of physics. Well, I don't think physics law, as we currently understand it, says that you can't move very,
    very quickly. There's no limit on acceleration or velocity to my understanding. Of course, Dr. Bartlett may be able to
    help us more than I can on that, but what I think you meant to say is it defies any technology we know that can achieve
    those kinds of accelerations and motions. Am I correct in understanding that?

  source_text: Well, more than that, what he meant was that if there was a fighter pilot in that other aircraft, he would
    have died from the G-forces. There were so many extreme maneuvers that this thing had made. Actually, he was convinced
    that it was of alien origin. Because of that, he actually went to college for his aerospace engineering degree. Then he
    worked with Werner von Braun in the NASA space program under the Saturn and several of the moon launches.

    wanted knowledge. He's wondering if there might be another extraterrestrial explanation of what he observed. It's interesting
    because— I need to reclaim my time, I'm sorry. It's an interesting answer. What I was going to tell you is out of all
    the people in my life I've encountered, my dad was a constant scientist. He was an atheist. He was just this total white-lane
    brain.

  source_text: I'm going to turn to you and ask you this. Researchers have looked at a lot of things related to this. The
    maneuver abilities are certainly interesting. One of the reasons why I think there is skepticism that these objects have
    extraterrestrial origins is because of, I'll just put it bluntly, Einstein's relativity theory that nothing can go faster
    than the speed of light. What are the most compelling studies of people that could explain distance questions without
    suspending Einstein's theory of relativity, law of physics that's well accepted that nothing can travel faster than the
    speed of light? Mr. Cook, I'm very, very grateful you asked that question. First of all, I just want to mention that regarding
    atmospheric phenomena, atmospheric objects that seem to defy the laws of physics, but of course they don't.

  source_text: Nothing defies the laws of physics. The question was asked previously, why don't they make sonic booms? How
    do the piles withstand G-forces? All of this is related. I would just point out there was an outstanding study done years
    ago by a retired NASA scientist, Paul Hill, who was known throughout NASA as their go-to guy for UFOs. His exact question
    was how is it that UFOs do what they do? His conclusion in his study published posthumously in the 1990s called Unconventional
    Flying Objects of Scientific Analysis was that they do not.

  source_text: But actually, he did an outstanding work. His mathematics is very sound, and I would simply recommend it to
    everyone. Now the distance problem has also been discussed by a number of scientists in the last generation. Probably
    most famously, the mathematician Miguel Alcubierre, who, the math on what he did seems to be very, very good according
    to physicists, essentially think warp drive and Star Trek in the sense that if you have a source of power significant
    enough, it is possible and has been demonstrated mathematically for a craft literally to kind of shrink the space ahead
    and elongate it behind. You're not violating Einstein's E equals MC squared. It is literally space itself. I am going
    to reclaim my time only for the reason to just get this last question to you. When you say that you are kind of using
    anti-gravity as a way of saying we don't have to suspend Einstein's first theory of relativity, but

    or statements or proposed theories that say, hey, if you travel at even 10% of the speed of light and if you have... Oh,
    absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, Stan and Friedman, who is here earlier this week, has discussed this at length. There
    is a gentleman named Paul LeVoillet, another named Thomas Vallone, both of whom have done a lot of work in electrogravitics.
    I think it is very sound and worth anyone's attention. Thank you. I see my time has expired. So we are going with you,
    Representative Fire. Thank you very much.

    That there is a cloak of secrecy, I think, is undeniable. Like the symptoms of a very serious disease, if the doctor doesn't
    know the etiology of the disease, it becomes very difficult to treat the symptoms. How in the heck did we get here with
    this cloak of secrecy? You really can't treat the disease until you know how it was engendered. I appreciate your testimony,
    Mr. Dolan, very much. You suggested at least one possible etiology for this symptom of this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest
    another one that may give us the hope that it will be reversed. Because if you're right, and I hope you're not, but if
    you're right, there is no hope, or little hope, that they're going to reverse this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest another
    one. For 20 years before I came to

    you have been lying for sixty plus years? I think you tell them, sir, because you thought that was what you had to do
    because you couldn't have the kind of panic that occurred after the War of the Worlds, this little thing on radio. Certainly
    we agree on this. And certainly I think we could say that in the very beginning the secrecy would have started precisely
    because it was not known. How could President Truman really know what he was dealing with? How could his advisors really
    know?
