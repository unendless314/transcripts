    forever, you know. So if this procedure I'm going to have to clean the blood doesn't

    down. So that's kind of why I'm kind of going along with the interview at this
    time.

    text: 是的。隨著年紀越來越大，我現在77歲了。人不可能長生不老。所以如果我即將要做的血液淨化療程無效的話，大概再過幾個月我的腎臟就會衰竭。這就是為什麼我現在願意接受這次訪談的原因。

    as an instructor.

    explained to me that I could -- he could put it through, like, would have to get
    a top secret White House cue clearance for the job, you know. And I thought, boy,
    must be a pretty exclusive thing, you know. And I said, "Well, what is this?"
    And he said that I'm director for the CIA for eastern United States, you know.
    And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that." And he said, "You weren't supposed to."

    text: 還沒有。過了一天，我的上司來找我說：「你想不想賺點外快？」我說：「錢當然是好事。」於是他向我解釋說，要接下這個工作必須取得最高機密白宮 Q 級許可（top

    my CIA card. It was an ID card, like a credit card, where I could just go up to
    the door and slice it, walk right in. And my name at that time, I used an artificial
    name, too. Never used my real name. I started working with him on the project
    he was on. And that was Project Blue Book, which was kind of partially a fraud.
  translation:
    text: 大約六週後，我的安全許可通過了，我拿到了 CIA 證件。那是一張像信用卡一樣的身份證，我只需要到門口刷卡就能直接進去。那時我用的也是化名，從來沒用過真名。我開始和他一起從事他手上的專案，那就是藍皮書計畫（Project

    couldn't replicate what they found, they might have learned a few things. Some
    such claims have been made, and it's reasonable to suppose that breakthroughs
    would have been made. Breakthroughs such as solid state electronics, fiber optics,
    high tensile fibers, lasers, and an array of other money-making opportunities
    for the defense and other industries. None of this has been proven, but it is
    also true that the private research undertaken in classified environments is not
    easy for outside researchers to observe. In fact, it would be very easy to hide
    the Roswell connection in the historical treatment of these and other technologies.
    Another relevant consideration of such breakthroughs is that they would reduce

    of the organization I mentioned earlier in my statement, NARCAP, which is the
    National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomenon. I mention them because
    they are very rigorous, very scientific, very low key, very nonsensational, and
    deal precisely with these individuals that you're talking about and have done
    so for decades. There have been a number of cases in which we've had pilots go
    on the record. In fact, there's no lack of very good data and information out
    there. The problem is, unfortunately, that these individuals who are all sober
    and careful and, as you heard in the previous panel, still get ridiculed by the
    media. They get the tinfoil hat placed on them. This is something that none of
    us have found a way to get around that, no matter how rigorous we are. In my own
    work years ago when I started

    study and monitor the geopolitical territorial conflicts of three extraterrestrial
    biological entities who have been involved with this planet for at least 270 million
    years." He broke them down as blonde-haired, blue-eyed that we would not distinguish

    or claim to have, sometimes I think persuasively to be honest with you, some form
    of contact with other beings that is not physical. This is a very difficult subject

    yes or no question. You said that what your father witnessed in terms of the maneuverability
    of a particular object defied the law of physics. Well, I don't think physics
    law, as we currently understand it, says that you can't move very, very quickly.
    There's no limit on acceleration or velocity to my understanding. Of course, Dr.
    Bartlett may be able to help us more than I can on that, but what I think you

    out there that have put together concepts or statements or proposed theories that
    say, hey, if you travel at even 10% of the speed of light and if you have... Oh,
    absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, Stan and Friedman, who is here earlier this week,
    has discussed this at length. There is a gentleman named Paul LeVoillet, another
    named Thomas Vallone, both of whom have done a lot of work in electrogravitics.
    I think it is very sound and worth anyone's attention. Thank you. I see my time
    has expired. So we are going with you, Representative Fire. Thank you very much.

    Thank you all very much for your testimony. That there is a cloak of secrecy,
    I think, is undeniable. Like the symptoms of a very serious disease, if the doctor
    doesn't know the etiology of the disease, it becomes very difficult to treat the
    symptoms. How in the heck did we get here with this cloak of secrecy? You really
    can't treat the disease until you know how it was engendered. I appreciate your
    testimony, Mr. Dolan, very much. You suggested at least one possible etiology
    for this symptom of this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest another one that may
    give us the hope that it will be reversed. Because if you're right, and I hope
    you're not, but if you're right, there is no hope, or little hope, that they're
    going to reverse this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest another one. For 20 years
