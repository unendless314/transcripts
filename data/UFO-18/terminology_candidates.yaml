      not alone in this universe, that nonhumans have been interacting with this planet
      for millennia, and you have just heard from one of the firsthand. I had placed
      before you a prepared statement concerning truth embargo and a whole other experience
      that I had in Kirtland Air Force Base in 1983 that would have been a decade
      before being able to talk with this man. I hope that you will read it in its
      entirety. I know I don't have time this morning to go through it, but I can
      summarize that blocking truth, that we're calling the truth embargo, has been
      the intent of the American government's official policy of denial since 1947
      when the President Truman administration decided that all information about
      nonhuman intelligences interacting with this planet should be kept from the
      public and media, and that includes Congress and

    source_text: I would start by saying one of the striking things about UFOs is
      simply the discrepancy between the quantity of astonishing sightings we have
      on the one hand and the lack of responsible treatment of this by our major media,
      also our academic and our scientific institutions and indeed our political system.
      This is a shame because there's very good research that's being done every day.
      Many of those researchers have been here this week. Others are out there too
      such as the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, NARCAP,
      which was referenced in the previous panel by Jim Courant. They collect and
      analyze encounters that the aviation industry has had with unknown objects.
      There are thousands of such cases.

      can place thoughts, images, movies, symbols, directly into human minds very
      easily, they simultaneously upload information from human minds. And I have
      had the experience of talking with a man who was working for the Central Intelligence
      Agency when he had an interaction with one of these beings. There have been
      many, sir. And that his whole mission was to have the experience of the upload

      an hour special called UFOs the ET Factor. And at the time, there was an attorney

      Agency, and other military agencies under the brand new Freedom of Information

      a New York attorney representing citizens against UFO secrecy and what was called

      Why waste your time with that nonsense?" Another equally small group made it
      clear that they had been briefed on the matter and knew that it was serious.

      simply the discrepancy between the quantity of astonishing sightings we have
      on the one hand and the lack of responsible treatment of this by our major media,
      also our academic and our scientific institutions and indeed our political system.
      This is a shame because there's very good research that's being done every day.
      Many of those researchers have been here this week. Others are out there too
      such as the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, NARCAP,
      which was referenced in the previous panel by Jim Courant. They collect and
      analyze encounters that the aviation industry has had with unknown objects.
      There are thousands of such cases.

      them because they are very rigorous, very scientific, very low key, very nonsensational,
      and deal precisely with these individuals that you're talking about and have
      done so for decades. There have been a number of cases in which we've had pilots
      go on the record. In fact, there's no lack of very good data and information
      out there. The problem is, unfortunately, that these individuals who are all
      sober and careful and, as you heard in the previous panel, still get ridiculed
      by the media. They get the tinfoil hat placed on them. This is something that

      this is related. I would just point out there was an outstanding study done
      years ago by a retired NASA scientist, Paul Hill, who was known throughout NASA
      as their go-to guy for UFOs. His exact question was how is it that UFOs do what
      they do? His conclusion in his study published posthumously in the 1990s called
      Unconventional Flying Objects of Scientific Analysis was that they do not.

    source_text: I'm going to turn to you and ask you this. Researchers have looked
      at a lot of things related to this. The maneuver abilities are certainly interesting.
      One of the reasons why I think there is skepticism that these objects have extraterrestrial
      origins is because of, I'll just put it bluntly, Einstein's relativity theory
      that nothing can go faster than the speed of light. What are the most compelling
      studies of people that could explain distance questions without suspending Einstein's
      theory of relativity, law of physics that's well accepted that nothing can travel
      faster than the speed of light? Mr. Cook, I'm very, very grateful you asked
      that question. First of all, I just want to mention that regarding atmospheric
      phenomena, atmospheric objects that seem to defy the laws of physics, but of
      course they don't.

    source_text: But actually, he did an outstanding work. His mathematics is very
      sound, and I would simply recommend it to everyone. Now the distance problem
      has also been discussed by a number of scientists in the last generation. Probably
      most famously, the mathematician Miguel Alcubierre, who, the math on what he
      did seems to be very, very good according to physicists, essentially think warp
      drive and Star Trek in the sense that if you have a source of power significant
      enough, it is possible and has been demonstrated mathematically for a craft
      literally to kind of shrink the space ahead and elongate it behind. You're not
      violating Einstein's E equals MC squared. It is literally space itself. I am
      going to reclaim my time only for the reason to just get this last question
      to you. When you say that you are kind of using anti-gravity as a way of saying
      we don't have to suspend Einstein's first theory of relativity, but

      fact their, the etiology for this, then it becomes pretty easy to reverse it.
      Because now after all these years, there is no evidence that if they are extraterrestrials,
      there is no evidence that they are hostile.

    source_text: Wise words, sir. I agree with you. I think that the secret has its
      own momentum. It generates its own profitability. It generates its own bureaucracy.
      It generates its own need to continue, it seems to me. How do you tell the world
      that you have been lying for sixty plus years? I think you tell them, sir, because
      you thought that was what you had to do because you couldn't have the kind of
      panic that occurred after the War of the Worlds, this little thing on radio.
      Certainly we agree on this. And certainly I think we could say that in the very
      beginning the secrecy would have started precisely because it was not known.
      How could President Truman really know what he was dealing with? How could his
      advisors really know?

    source_text: It depends on what evidence you judge. There are leaked documents.
      I consider them legitimate by and large. These are housed. One of the witnesses
      here, Dr. Robert Wood, is one of the individuals who has discussed them. They
      are called the majestic documents. If you take them at face value, it has been
      known since very early on, since the 1940s, that there are other entities that
      are here, extraterrestrial biological entities.
