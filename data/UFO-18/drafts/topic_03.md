## Speaker Group 1

106. This is time. Thank you. I would like to now the panel will hear from Richard Dolan. You have ten minutes. Greetings, honored members of the committee.
→ {"text": "時間到了。謝謝。現在委員會將聽取理查德·多蘭的證詞。您有十分鐘。尊敬的委員會成員，大家好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

107. I'm very pleased about the interview that everyone was just shown and grateful that Linda Moulton Howe was able to elaborate on that. I'm happy to discuss this also if the committee members have questions but I have a different angle of approach this time. The truth embargo as I see it, as I understand it, let's call it a big picture analysis.
→ {"text": "我對於剛才播放的訪談內容感到非常欣慰，也很感謝琳達·莫爾頓·豪能夠進一步闡述。如果委員會成員有問題，我也很樂意討論，但這次我採取不同的角度。就我看待和理解的方式，讓我們稱之為真相封鎖的宏觀分析。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "truth embargo 譯為「真相封鎖」，依據 terminology.yaml"}

108. I would start by saying one of the striking things about UFOs is simply the discrepancy between the quantity of astonishing sightings we have on the one hand and the lack of responsible treatment of this by our major media, also our academic and our scientific institutions and indeed our political system. This is a shame because there's very good research that's being done every day. Many of those researchers have been here this week. Others are out there too such as the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, NARCAP, which was referenced in the previous panel by Jim Courant. They collect and analyze encounters that the aviation industry has had with unknown objects. There are thousands of such cases.
→ {"text": "首先我要說，關於UFO最令人震驚的一點，在於我們擁有大量驚人的目擊事件，但主流媒體、學術機構、科學機構乃至政治體系卻未能認真對待這個議題，兩者之間存在著巨大落差。這實在令人遺憾，因為每天都有非常優秀的研究正在進行。許多研究者本週也出席了聽證會。還有其他研究機構，例如航空異常現象報告中心（NARCAP），吉姆·庫朗在前一個小組討論中曾提及。他們收集並分析航空業遭遇不明物體的案例，這類案例有數千起之多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "NARCAP 保留原文，依據 terminology.yaml；Jim Courant 譯為吉姆·庫朗"}

109. Another group is Project 1947, which has documented UFO phenomena during the early Cold War years.
→ {"text": "另一個組織是1947年計畫（Project 1947），他們記錄了冷戰早期的UFO現象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Project 1947 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為「1947年計畫」"}

110. There are outstanding web search websites such as ufoevidence.org. There are also many excellent research groups in Europe and elsewhere in the world. None of them get any love from America's dumbed-down media, which prefers to lump the whole subject into a big tinfoil hat and instead write about the latest escapades of Kim Kardashian. This is a symptom. It's a symptom of a deeper problem. To understand why there is a truth embargo, we need to come to terms with the fact that America's major media groups lost their independence a long time ago. We all know about media consolidation. We all know about the intimate relationships that have existed for years between the elite members in the corporate media empire and the political leadership and particularly with the military and intelligence community.
→ {"text": "還有許多優秀的網站如ufoevidence.org，以及歐洲和世界各地出色的研究團體。但這些機構都得不到美國弱智化媒體的青睞，媒體寧願將整個議題歸類為「錫箔帽陰謀論」，轉而去報導金·卡戴珊的最新八卦。這是一種症狀，是更深層問題的徵兆。要理解為何存在真相封鎖，我們必須正視一個事實：美國主要媒體集團早已喪失獨立性。我們都知道媒體整合的現象，也都知道企業媒體帝國的精英成員與政治領導層，特別是與軍方和情報界之間，多年來存在著密切關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "dumbed-down media 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為「弱智化媒體」；tinfoil hat 為陰謀論者刻板印象，保留英文意象譯為「錫箔帽陰謀論」"}

111. Last year, one example only, it was learned that the Pentagon spends some $4 billion a year to sway public opinion. Now, aside from asking just why Americans ought to be paying their own government to brainwash them, I mean, talk about getting shafted both ways, right? This is just one facet of many that highlight a revolving door through which passes the military industrial complex, the media, the academic community and more. National security money, which is our nation's greatest and most egregious waste of all, has infiltrated everything and that certainly means the once-upon-a-time integrity of our journalists and media corporations.
→ {"text": "舉個例子，去年我們得知五角大廈每年花費約40億美元來影響輿論。且不問為何美國人應該付錢給自己的政府來對自己進行洗腦，這簡直是兩頭受騙，對吧？這只是眾多現象中的一個，凸顯了軍工複合體、媒體、學術界等之間的旋轉門現象。國家安全經費是我國最嚴重、最惡劣的浪費，它已滲透到各個領域，當然也包括記者和媒體公司曾經擁有的誠信。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "military industrial complex 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為「軍工複合體」"}

112. This is repugnant to any freedom-loving people. But those individuals benefiting from this system are not freedom-loving unless they mean their own freedom. The bottom line is that because UFOs are a definite matter of national security, those national security decision-makers have made it certain that this subject remains out of sight as much as possible. Is this not obvious by now? Now, why would they do this? Well, many reasons.
→ {"text": "這對任何熱愛自由的人民來說都是可憎的。但從這個體系中獲益的那些人並不熱愛自由，除非他們指的是自己的自由。歸根結底，由於UFO確實是國家安全事務，那些國家安全決策者確保這個議題盡可能不被看見。這難道還不明顯嗎？那麼，他們為何要這樣做？原因有很多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. Let's touch on the matter of oil because even a child can understand that these objects don't need oil to go from point A to point B. Whatever powers, flying saucers, it's something different, something better. So if the President were to announce the reality of these things, how long do you think it would take before scientists openly begin to study the nature of the propulsion and power system of UFOs? This would immediately challenge oil, not simply as the world's leading source of power, but it would severely threaten the entire global financial system, which is based upon oil. And probably 90 percent of the value of any product you can think of is determined by the energy that went into making and transporting it, and in most cases that means oil. To say nothing of the millions of jobs that rely on the petroleum industry. We're talking one big overhaul of everything
→ {"text": "讓我們談談石油的問題，因為連小孩子都明白，這些物體從A點移動到B點不需要石油。無論是什麼驅動飛碟，那都是不同的東西，更好的東西。所以如果總統宣布這些事物的真實性，您認為科學家們需要多久就會開始公開研究UFO的推進和動力系統？這將立即挑戰石油，不僅僅是作為世界主要能源，更會嚴重威脅整個以石油為基礎的全球金融體系。而且，任何產品價值的90%可能都取決於製造和運輸過程中所消耗的能量，而在大多數情況下，這意味著石油。更不用說依賴石油產業的數百萬個工作機會。我們談論的是對一切事物的全面重組", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. that matters in the global economy. Can we think for an instant that those individuals in the know haven't thought about this? Especially if there is that holy grail involved, some form of free energy. What if this new form of energy can't be easily monetized? What if? Could the global financial structure afford free energy? A perverse question to be sure, but one that has to be important to those individuals at the top of the human power structure. And of course there is the political nightmare. Any announcement of this reality would come at the cost of worldwide public anger. No one wants to learn that they've been lied to for an entire human lifetime. They would want to know just how this secret was kept. That's very, very big key right there. That would lead inevitably to questions about why Congress was kept out of the loop, why our major institutions missed the boat,
→ {"text": "，以及全球經濟中所有重要的事物。我們能想像那些知情者從未考慮過這一點嗎？特別是如果涉及到聖杯——某種形式的免費能源。如果這種新能源無法輕易貨幣化呢？如果真是這樣呢？全球金融結構能承受得起免費能源嗎？這確實是個悖德的問題，但對於人類權力結構頂層的那些人來說，這必定是個重要的問題。當然還有政治上的噩夢。任何關於此事實的宣布都將以全球公眾的憤怒為代價。沒有人想得知自己被欺騙了一輩子。他們會想知道這個秘密是如何被保密的。這是非常、非常關鍵的一點。這將不可避免地引發質疑：為何國會被蒙在鼓裡，為何我們的主要機構錯過了這一切，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. and just who has been managing the secret. And that would lead, obviously, to a wholesale investigation of black budget America shining sunlight into a very dark place. And what might we find? Well, consider. Just consider that Roswell was indeed what the researchers here two days ago discussed so eloquently and cogently, that it was the retrieval of alien technology and perhaps bodies. In fact, there are a number of well-researched UFO crash events. So suppose for a moment that it happened. That would mean that the cover-up involves much more than mere knowledge of other beings here on planet Earth. It would mean there is possession of such advanced technology as to be nearly incomprehensible at least at first. Hard to consider, and yet an inevitable conclusion. So what happens when teams of brilliant scientists with total secrecy and nearly limitless black budget
→ {"text": "以及究竟是誰在管理這個秘密。顯然，這將導致對美國黑預算的全面調查，將陽光照進一個非常黑暗的地方。我們可能會發現什麼？想想看。想想羅斯威爾事件確實如兩天前研究人員所闡述的那樣，是回收外星科技，也許還有遺體。事實上，有許多經過充分研究的UFO墜毀事件。所以假設這真的發生了。這意味著掩蓋行動不僅僅涉及對地球上其他生命體的認知，更意味著掌握了如此先進的技術，起初幾乎難以理解。難以想像，但卻是不可避免的結論。那麼，當一群傑出的科學家在完全保密且幾乎無限的黑預算", "confidence": "high", "notes": "black budget 依據 terminology.yaml 譯為「黑預算」"}

116. funds are able to study recovered alien technology for many years and even decades? Could it not be that given enough time and effort, even if they couldn't replicate what they found, they might have learned a few things. Some such claims have been made, and it's reasonable to suppose that breakthroughs would have been made. Breakthroughs such as solid state electronics, fiber optics, high tensile fibers, lasers, and an array of other money-making opportunities for the defense and other industries. None of this has been proven, but it is also true that the private research undertaken in classified environments is not easy for outside researchers to observe. In fact, it would be very easy to hide the Roswell connection in the historical treatment of these and other technologies. Another relevant consideration of such breakthroughs is that they would reduce to zero any incentive to reveal the secret
→ {"text": "資金支持下，能夠研究回收的外星科技多年甚至數十年？難道不可能嗎？只要有足夠的時間和努力，即使他們無法複製所發現的東西，也可能學到了一些東西。已經有人提出這類說法，而且合理推測應該已經取得了突破。例如固態電子學、光纖、高強度纖維、雷射，以及國防和其他產業的一系列其他商機。這些都尚未被證實，但同樣真實的是，在機密環境中進行的私人研究並不容易被外部研究者觀察到。事實上，在這些和其他技術的歷史論述中隱藏與羅斯威爾的關聯是非常容易的。另一個相關考量是，這些突破將使揭露秘密的動機降至零", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. to the public. Why give up the goose that lays golden eggs? But now matters become even more interesting, because what if some of the breakthroughs were even more significant?
→ {"text": "，何必放棄那隻會下金蛋的鵝呢？但現在事情變得更有趣了，因為如果某些突破更加重大呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. What if they included secrets to what is known as field propulsion or electro-gravitics?
→ {"text": "如果它們包含了所謂場推進或電重力學的祕密呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "field propulsion 譯為「場推進」，electro-gravitics 譯為「電重力學」，依據 terminology.yaml"}

119. What if they led to a new source of energy, something that could replace petroleum? To those managing these special access programs, they could never allow such breakthroughs to see the light of day. Of course, those scientists doing the research would need to continue and learn everything they could about electro-gravitics, anti-gravity, new sources of energy, and any related topics. Consider also what happens when such breakthroughs become classified. We know it happens all too frequently that public science has become hostage to national security. What we're looking at is a situation in which the classified black-budget world, at least part of it, has gone so far ahead of the rest of us, we may with justice almost look upon them as a separate society, something I have sometimes called a breakaway civilization. How far ahead might some of that classified world be? Those of

120. us on the outside trying to peek in can only make educated guesses or investigate occasional leaks. My own conclusion, at least for now, is that they are very far ahead indeed, with the ability even to enter and leave Earth orbit with much greater ease than people suspect, perhaps a clandestine space fleet, most likely a significant built infrastructure, a large portion of which is deep underground, and even, why not, possible encounters with non-human intelligences? Why would that be so impossible? To what extent would such a group even answer to the President of the United States? Do they rather answer to private, international financial powers, which basically is how the whole world already operates? I had a long conversation once with a retired senior intelligence official. He had given briefings to- I hate to interrupt. The witness has about one minute, at least one.
→ {"text": "試圖窺探內情的外界人士只能做出有根據的猜測，或調查偶爾洩漏的資訊。我目前的結論是，他們確實遙遙領先，甚至可能比人們想像的更容易進出地球軌道，也許是一支秘密太空艦隊，很可能擁有龐大的基礎設施，其中很大一部分深藏地下，甚至，為什麼不可能呢，可能還與非人類智慧生命有過接觸？為什麼這會是不可能的？這樣的團體在多大程度上會聽命於美國總統？他們是否反而聽命於私人的國際金融勢力，而這基本上就是整個世界目前的運作方式？我曾與一位退休的高級情報官員進行過長談。他曾向——抱歉打斷。證人還有大約一分鐘，至少一分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. One minute left, thank you. This gentleman had given briefings to President Reagan. This man knows a very great deal about UFOs and told me that he had spoken to 18 former presidents, CIA directors, and DOD secretaries about UFOs after their retirement. Their attitudes fell into three categories. One group, roughly three or four of them, said essentially, "What's wrong with you? Why waste your time with that nonsense?" Another equally small group made it clear that they had been briefed on the matter and knew that it was serious. But the largest group, at least half of all of the individuals who had been at the pinnacle of power, had said, "You know about UFOs? I would love to know about that, but got nowhere.
→ {"text": "還剩一分鐘，謝謝。這位先生曾向雷根總統做過簡報。此人對UFO了解甚深，告訴我他在18位卸任總統、CIA局長和國防部長退休後與他們談論過UFO。他們的態度可分為三類。其中一組，大約三到四人，基本上說：「你有什麼問題？為什麼浪費時間在這種無聊事上？」另一個同樣小的群體明確表示他們曾接受過相關簡報，知道這是嚴肅的事。但最大的群體，至少佔所有曾處於權力頂峰者的一半，曾說：「你了解UFO？我很想知道這件事，但毫無頭緒。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. Can you share what you know?" In other words, our top political leadership, with a few exceptions, is locked out of this subject because they come and go. But the program managers are lifers. They seem to answer to someone else. Recall the words of the late Senator Daniel Inouye from 1987, "There exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of national interests, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself." He was on to something.
→ {"text": "你能分享你所知道的嗎？」換句話說，除了少數例外，我們的最高政治領導層被排除在這個議題之外，因為他們來來去去。但計畫管理者是終身職。他們似乎聽命於其他人。回想已故丹尼爾·井上參議員1987年的話：「存在一個影子政府，擁有自己的空軍、自己的海軍、自己的籌資機制，以及追求其自身國家利益觀念的能力，不受任何制衡，也不受法律約束。」他說對了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Daniel Inouye 譯為丹尼爾·井上，依據 terminology.yaml"}
