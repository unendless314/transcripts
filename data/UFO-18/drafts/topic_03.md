106. This is time. Thank you. I would like to now the panel will hear from Richard Dolan. You have ten minutes. Greetings, honored members of the committee.

107. I'm very pleased about the interview that everyone was just shown and grateful that Linda Moulton Howe was able to elaborate on that. I'm happy to discuss this also if the committee members have questions but I have a different angle of approach this time. The truth embargo as I see it, as I understand it, let's call it a big picture analysis.

108. I would start by saying one of the striking things about UFOs is simply the discrepancy between the quantity of astonishing sightings we have on the one hand and the lack of responsible treatment of this by our major media, also our academic and our scientific institutions and indeed our political system. This is a shame because there's very good research that's being done every day. Many of those researchers have been here this week. Others are out there too such as the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, NARCAP, which was referenced in the previous panel by Jim Courant. They collect and analyze encounters that the aviation industry has had with unknown objects. There are thousands of such cases.

109. Another group is Project 1947, which has documented UFO phenomena during the early Cold War years.

110. There are outstanding web search websites such as ufoevidence.org. There are also many excellent research groups in Europe and elsewhere in the world. None of them get any love from America's dumbed-down media, which prefers to lump the whole subject into a big tinfoil hat and instead write about the latest escapades of Kim Kardashian. This is a symptom. It's a symptom of a deeper problem. To understand why there is a truth embargo, we need to come to terms with the fact that America's major media groups lost their independence a long time ago. We all know about media consolidation. We all know about the intimate relationships that have existed for years between the elite members in the corporate media empire and the political leadership and particularly with the military and intelligence community.

111. Last year, one example only, it was learned that the Pentagon spends some $4 billion a year to sway public opinion. Now, aside from asking just why Americans ought to be paying their own government to brainwash them, I mean, talk about getting shafted both ways, right? This is just one facet of many that highlight a revolving door through which passes the military industrial complex, the media, the academic community and more. National security money, which is our nation's greatest and most egregious waste of all, has infiltrated everything and that certainly means the once-upon-a-time integrity of our journalists and media corporations.

112. This is repugnant to any freedom-loving people. But those individuals benefiting from this system are not freedom-loving unless they mean their own freedom. The bottom line is that because UFOs are a definite matter of national security, those national security decision-makers have made it certain that this subject remains out of sight as much as possible. Is this not obvious by now? Now, why would they do this? Well, many reasons.

113. Let's touch on the matter of oil because even a child can understand that these objects don't need oil to go from point A to point B. Whatever powers, flying saucers, it's something different, something better. So if the President were to announce the reality of these things, how long do you think it would take before scientists openly begin to study the nature of the propulsion and power system of UFOs? This would immediately challenge oil, not simply as the world's leading source of power, but it would severely threaten the entire global financial system, which is based upon oil. And probably 90 percent of the value of any product you can think of is determined by the energy that went into making and transporting it, and in most cases that means oil. To say nothing of the millions of jobs that rely on the petroleum industry. We're talking one big overhaul of everything
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. that matters in the global economy. Can we think for an instant that those individuals in the know haven't thought about this? Especially if there is that holy grail involved, some form of free energy. What if this new form of energy can't be easily monetized? What if? Could the global financial structure afford free energy? A perverse question to be sure, but one that has to be important to those individuals at the top of the human power structure. And of course there is the political nightmare. Any announcement of this reality would come at the cost of worldwide public anger. No one wants to learn that they've been lied to for an entire human lifetime. They would want to know just how this secret was kept. That's very, very big key right there. That would lead inevitably to questions about why Congress was kept out of the loop, why our major institutions missed the boat,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. and just who has been managing the secret. And that would lead, obviously, to a wholesale investigation of black budget America shining sunlight into a very dark place. And what might we find? Well, consider. Just consider that Roswell was indeed what the researchers here two days ago discussed so eloquently and cogently, that it was the retrieval of alien technology and perhaps bodies. In fact, there are a number of well-researched UFO crash events. So suppose for a moment that it happened. That would mean that the cover-up involves much more than mere knowledge of other beings here on planet Earth. It would mean there is possession of such advanced technology as to be nearly incomprehensible at least at first. Hard to consider, and yet an inevitable conclusion. So what happens when teams of brilliant scientists with total secrecy and nearly limitless black budget
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. funds are able to study recovered alien technology for many years and even decades? Could it not be that given enough time and effort, even if they couldn't replicate what they found, they might have learned a few things. Some such claims have been made, and it's reasonable to suppose that breakthroughs would have been made. Breakthroughs such as solid state electronics, fiber optics, high tensile fibers, lasers, and an array of other money-making opportunities for the defense and other industries. None of this has been proven, but it is also true that the private research undertaken in classified environments is not easy for outside researchers to observe. In fact, it would be very easy to hide the Roswell connection in the historical treatment of these and other technologies. Another relevant consideration of such breakthroughs is that they would reduce to zero any incentive to reveal the secret

117. to the public. Why give up the goose that lays golden eggs? But now matters become even more interesting, because what if some of the breakthroughs were even more significant?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. What if they included secrets to what is known as field propulsion or electro-gravitics?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. What if they led to a new source of energy, something that could replace petroleum? To those managing these special access programs, they could never allow such breakthroughs to see the light of day. Of course, those scientists doing the research would need to continue and learn everything they could about electro-gravitics, anti-gravity, new sources of energy, and any related topics. Consider also what happens when such breakthroughs become classified. We know it happens all too frequently that public science has become hostage to national security. What we're looking at is a situation in which the classified black-budget world, at least part of it, has gone so far ahead of the rest of us, we may with justice almost look upon them as a separate society, something I have sometimes called a breakaway civilization. How far ahead might some of that classified world be? Those of
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. us on the outside trying to peek in can only make educated guesses or investigate occasional leaks. My own conclusion, at least for now, is that they are very far ahead indeed, with the ability even to enter and leave Earth orbit with much greater ease than people suspect, perhaps a clandestine space fleet, most likely a significant built infrastructure, a large portion of which is deep underground, and even, why not, possible encounters with non-human intelligences? Why would that be so impossible? To what extent would such a group even answer to the President of the United States? Do they rather answer to private, international financial powers, which basically is how the whole world already operates? I had a long conversation once with a retired senior intelligence official. He had given briefings to- I hate to interrupt. The witness has about one minute, at least one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. One minute left, thank you. This gentleman had given briefings to President Reagan. This man knows a very great deal about UFOs and told me that he had spoken to 18 former presidents, CIA directors, and DOD secretaries about UFOs after their retirement. Their attitudes fell into three categories. One group, roughly three or four of them, said essentially, "What's wrong with you? Why waste your time with that nonsense?" Another equally small group made it clear that they had been briefed on the matter and knew that it was serious. But the largest group, at least half of all of the individuals who had been at the pinnacle of power, had said, "You know about UFOs? I would love to know about that, but got nowhere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. Can you share what you know?" In other words, our top political leadership, with a few exceptions, is locked out of this subject because they come and go. But the program managers are lifers. They seem to answer to someone else. Recall the words of the late Senator Daniel Inouye from 1987, "There exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of national interests, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself." He was on to something.
