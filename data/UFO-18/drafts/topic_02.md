## Speaker Group 1

92. I'd like to now hear from Linda Moulton Howe. Go ahead. You've got 10 minutes.

93. In the summer of 1994, I spent three days and three nights in that gentleman's home.

94. No one on the planet knew where I was, not my family, not anyone.

95. I recorded 11 90-minute audiotapes with him. I knew that I was in the presence of somebody who was telling the truth to the best of his ability and that the military cover of levels of intelligence in this country has been used for a very long time. On the surface, he was a cryptologist working in the United States Army, but as he described in the film, he took on a role, highly classified, working for the CIA, and his boss was reporting to Langley from reports that were coming into Fort Belvoir. He described to me in great detail the autopsy footage that he had seen of nonhumans describing the unusual brains and the unusual internal organs, and the fact that they were screening film disguised as being on a southeastern military base, and that the film that they were screening on a regular basis was coming from around the world. He had seen film from Italy in which

96. nonhumans were outside of a craft, and the film had been taken from a nearby peak in a mountain. He talked about Area 51 from his first-hand experience of being there on the other side of what would be a one-way mirror while his boss from Langley was inside with a nonhuman, and that he himself had seen some of the craft, like a museum that's inside of Papoose Mountain. After those three days and three nights where no one knew where I was, I left to do something that would be normal in the normal nine-to-five world, and when I returned to my home then in Philadelphia, I remember going to the phone and voicemail, and the last thing that we had agreed upon was that I would return in approximately four weeks with a video crew in which I was preparing a statement for him and for me to sign that I would do a videotape interview like my 11 audio tapes, and I would hold it until after

97. his death. He thought that he was not going to live very long in '94. So I was surprised to hear his voice on my voicemail say, "Linda, my wife and I went to the supermarket after you left, and two men were leaning against our car when we came out of the supermarket, and they said, 'We want to remind you that you have been a loyal American, and we are here to tell you that you are never to talk with Linda Moulton Howe again or to discuss this subject.'" None of those 11 hours of my audio tapes would have been in the phone calls, so it means that they were listening to our three days and three nights in the house, and I promised him from that point on that I would never discuss him or the material, and in fact, later on, I received information from someone unknown that he was dead. So I am personally gratified to see that he made a statement today for this citizen hearing

98. because he is scratching the surface of how complex this is and how military and intel people have been intimidated for not only their whole careers but their whole lives.

99. To never tell the truth about something so fundamental as we are not alone in this universe, that nonhumans have been interacting with this planet for millennia, and you have just heard from one of the firsthand. I had placed before you a prepared statement concerning truth embargo and a whole other experience that I had in Kirtland Air Force Base in 1983 that would have been a decade before being able to talk with this man. I hope that you will read it in its entirety. I know I don't have time this morning to go through it, but I can summarize that blocking truth, that we're calling the truth embargo, has been the intent of the American government's official policy of denial since 1947 when the President Truman administration decided that all information about nonhuman intelligences interacting with this planet should be kept from the public and media, and that includes Congress and

100. the Supreme Court and all machinery of our government except for those designated as having "a need to know" and the code words and the numbers that have gone with the few people who have had total access in MJ-12. I encountered truth embargoes repeatedly as I investigated the bloodless, trackless animal mutilations in Colorado and the surrounding region from my TV documentary special, A Strange Harvest, beginning in September of 1979, and I have provided for you a letter from United States Senator Harrison Schmidt, dated March 14, 1979. It is attached to my statement. It was a letter that Apollo astronaut and then US Senator Harrison Schmidt of New Mexico had sent to constituents announcing a conference in Albuquerque to be held on April 20, 1979 to discuss the ongoing persistent problem of animal mutilations, and he wanted the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. to investigate. And that 1979 meeting was held, and five months later in September 1979 as Director of Special Projects at the CBS station in Denver, I began what became a nine-month, 18-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week investigation. And I went to Santa Fe, and I did an interview with Senator Schmidt and one of the most important things that he told me was, to my question, are you aware of any intelligence committee or any agency that you have communicated with who has told you that we are dealing with extraterrestrial biological entities as perpetrators of worldwide animal mutilations as law enforcement repeatedly had told me? And I remember the pause and the look on his face when he said no, and I remember that his next words were, but I am not surprised at your question or the implications. And his request as a United States Senator to have the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation formally

102. investigate animal mutilations was blocked. He told me that firsthand. The rest of the pages of the statement that I have submitted to you occurred after I was contracted with Home Box Office on March 21, 1983, to do an hour special that would follow up a strange harvest about the animal mutilations, and they had a working title in the contract that I would produce for them, an hour special called UFOs the ET Factor. And at the time, there was an attorney in New York named Peter Gersten. He was the first attorney to file against the CIA, the NSA, National Reconnaissance Organization, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and other military agencies under the brand new Freedom of Information Act FOIA for documents that those agencies had. And what Peter Gersten found was initially the Central Intelligence Agency denied that it had any information or documents, but that the National Security

103. Agency had 118. So he would send the Central Intelligence Agency's formal letter to the National Security Agency asking for the documents referenced by the CIA. And the National Security Agency would send him a formal letter referencing the fact that the Central Intelligence Agency had 35 documents shared with the National Security Agency. And eventually, he assembled dozens of documents that came from those agencies, each one pointing a finger at the other. It went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court denied to hear what essentially was a New York attorney representing citizens against UFO secrecy and what was called ground saucer watch under the first Freedom of Information Act, simply asking for information from our government about documents that they all said they had. And even though the Supreme Court denied that they would take on that lawsuit, out of it came many pages of blacked out information

104. that has been held up by Stanton Friedman and others of us over the years that agencies who are not allowed to speak and who have been responsible for counterintelligence since World War II to convince us that there's nothing to this phenomena. The witness has about one minute remaining. They are the very agencies who have the information and have been interlinked with Majestic 12 that was appointed by President Harry S. Truman within a very short period of time after the crash retrievals in July of 1947 and that Majestic 12, MJ12, whatever the letters and numbers are in 2013, the same kind of inner sanctum agency still exists interacting with other inside inner sanctum black agencies. There is a parallel black budget. There's a parallel government. And this is how the truth that this gentleman described and that many people in our government have known since at least 1941 when there

105. was another crash retrieval from Missouri and an instrument called a Neutronic Propulsion Unit was hand delivered to Oppenheimer for his use in developing and researching what became the atomic bomb. And finally, the truth embargo so that you would have reference to the two agencies that in the beginning had the most information, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of the Navy, all of those documents of all of the truth that he has said that I have tried to report about now for 33 years, they are essentially off limits to any access by Congress or even the President because they are classified as only under a need to know and probably Suitland, Maryland archive has them.
