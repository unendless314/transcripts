143. Astrophysicists are saying these things are real and we're being ridiculed. That's all I have to say. Help this country. [Applause] Okay, we need to get going. I want to thank the panel very much and indicate to the members that we've got six minutes each for questioning. I will reserve my minutes and we'll reverse the order a bit here, so we're to Senator Grovel. Linda, would you, when this gentleman that was interviewed, and this would go to Richard also, when he was talking about that he saw an extraterrestrial being, was it dead or alive? So we had imprisoned this person or this being. Could you elaborate a little bit about that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Many more than one. We have had many more than one. In this particular case, this was at Area 51 inside of the Papoose Mountain. If you look at a map, the inside of the Papoose Mountain at Area 51 is an installation, multi-leveled, hidden by the Papoose Mountain. Many people have leaked to me and to others about working there. And in there are offices, as we would recognize as offices, and his CIA boss and the man in the film and a couple of others were taken to one of these offices where there was a one way on the other side. I don't know because it's his point of view. Was it a mirror or was it a reflective glass, but nevertheless, the man you just heard was standing on this side of the glass looking at his boss in the room with, I believe it was two others. And then the gray alien was dressed in something like they had tried to make it look sort of American. It had on a t-shirt and as if they
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. had put clothes on it right at the last minute for this meeting. And it was telepathic and each mind in the room was communicated with telepathically. And he had a discussion later on with his boss. And the general impression was that the non-human was trying to answer their questions, but that it was very succinct and that they ask questions such as how many of you are here on this planet? There would be no answer. There would be other questions that were of a technical nature and there would be no answer. And yet, on other questions, they all clearly heard telepathic information.

## Speaker Group 5

149. I would just add, I recall the witness speaking about that and certainly it's exactly right, Linda, what he said to me. In terms of the one, very few specific answers this being allegedly gave, but to one, why are they here? There was not a direct answer except a reply that we are not hostile or thoughts to that effect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

150. When you say telepathic, that means that the being was communicating directly, understood the way our mind worked. Now, were we able to telepathically communicate with them or was it a one way street?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

151. I can add something here along those lines. And then humans by definition live in a mental island. And we're dealing with intelligences that not only can place thoughts, images, movies, symbols, directly into human minds very easily, they simultaneously upload information from human minds. And I have had the experience of talking with a man who was working for the Central Intelligence Agency when he had an interaction with one of these beings. There have been many, sir. And that his whole mission was to have the experience of the upload download telepathically with a being under a completely nonthreatening, totally organized fashion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. And he told me that they had warned him that the process of the telepathic download upload usually disables humans, humans usually faint. And that he had the experience and the way he described it was he said, Linda, imagine seven feature films going through your mind at the same time with heat, temperature, sense, sound, all of the senses and more. And then overlying those seven feature films are three-dimensional gold symbols that we would relate probably to Sumerian cuneiform or Assyrian symbols. And that all of that goes through your head in a matter of what your brain, your human brain, not being able to interact but has a sense of very rapid time. And that when it's all over, as he said, if God asked me what had been downloaded into my mind, I could not tell you. But I know that everything that I have ever lived was uploaded. That is, frankly, the level of telepathic interaction that has
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. been going on in this planet for a very long time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. My time has expired, but maybe later on I'll come back because I have other questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. Thank you. We'll go to Representative Hooley. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. You talked about your father. Thank you very much for doing that. That he had kept the secret for years. How or why did he finally communicate the information to you and the family? Well, it started much later. He started organizing RAF Manston reunions. He so loved his squadron that he organized trips to England and cruises.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. And I met his buddies, by the way, and they were all just the greatest guys, a lot of them World War II veterans. And he would organize these trips. And, you know, I guess at this point he started trying to find out answers as to why this had happened to him. So he was asking his squadron mates. And I guess he felt a little comfortable at that point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. He had been retired for a number of years. And he ran across Nick Pope and they were able to declassify the event. But it took many years after that that it was declassified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. But he had started to speak about it after the reunions. But he would never speak publicly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. And you know, as a matter of fact, I had no idea that this had happened, that he had carried that burden. And my grandfather and him were extremely tight. And he cried that he couldn't tell his own father because of that secret. And he didn't tell his soul. Can you imagine dog fighting like this fellow the other day from Peru and yet when he landed, the spooks that were there on the ground greeted him and said, hey, let's find out what that was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. Our spooks told him never talk about it to anybody, including your wife, your kids, your family, your colonel, your commander. Nobody could he talk to. Nobody. And he carried that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. And I can tell you when I saw him cry on stage, my dad has now lost his voice because of, you know, Agent Orange and all of the crap that goes with it. But I found mine. I'm my father's son. I will get answers. I promised him that. So thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. Mr. Dolan, is there a way to put together people? For example, we've heard a lot over the last four and a half days about the number of pilots who have seen other kinds of vehicles that are not from the United States or from this world flying. Is there a way to get some of these pilots together? Are they willing to talk about what they saw? Do you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. Thank you for the question. First of all, I would just repeat the name of the organization I mentioned earlier in my statement, NARCAP, which is the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomenon. I mention them because they are very rigorous, very scientific, very low key, very nonsensational, and deal precisely with these individuals that you're talking about and have done so for decades. There have been a number of cases in which we've had pilots go on the record. In fact, there's no lack of very good data and information out there. The problem is, unfortunately, that these individuals who are all sober and careful and, as you heard in the previous panel, still get ridiculed by the media. They get the tinfoil hat placed on them. This is something that none of us have found a way to get around that, no matter how rigorous we are. In my own work years ago when I started
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. researching this phenomenon, I had this naive idea. Really, I did that. If I just did the most rigorous, careful, historical treatment of the phenomenon that I could, then that just might be the magic bullet, the bat that hits the ball out of the park. It didn't happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. We keep trying. I would say that we're in an era now where global communication among researchers has improved and is improving. I am looking forward to, I think, the next few years where there really should be better coordination among groups in the United States and elsewhere to be able to put together events like this. I think more is better.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. I think with the social media that there's a possibility that you might be able to do that. People seem to trust pilots. Rightfully or wrongfully, they trust pilots. They're the most logical group who fly all the time. We are back and forth across this country, across this world, that as they see what they've seen, it seems to me that there would be some validity. I mean, the public would accept that premise if enough of them got together and talked about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. When you add up enough of the near misses and encounters that are up in the air, it's startling.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. I noticed the gentlelady's time has expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. We'll then go to Representative Woolsey. You have six minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. Thank you, Jeffrey Torres, for your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. Thank you so much. Congratulations, Richard, for that video.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. You did such an amazing job. It was so helpful because you didn't leave the witness ever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. I mean, the gentleman, it was clear that's who he is and that's what he wanted to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. Linda, you have said, I think more than once this week, that non-humans are acting within our environment. What do you mean by that? And how do you know that's happening? And give me some examples.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. Other than being in a space vehicle and coming to Earth. Well, if that's it, tell me that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. I guess it's the accumulation of so many people that have talked to me off the record, who have died.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. Who have died?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. That I was given a chance to talk to people who were in some sort of the end of their days and I'd either been sought out or I had been referenced. And when you were talking to people who are essentially on their deathbed and they are describing for you the interactions that they've had with extraterrestrial biological entities in the context of their professional capacity for the United States government, how would I question what they were saying to me?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. Can I provide for you right here in this room one of the many different types of extraterrestrial biological entities? I cannot. Do I believe that these primarily male individuals who have shown to me at least enough evidence about where they worked publicly, which not always connects to where they get their paycheck, that they are telling me the truth about their life and their experiences with extraterrestrial biological entities, craft, technology, the physics that we have been encountering and stunned by?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. I believe them. And I'm a long time TV producer and investigative reporter. And as I have said before, the challenge of getting people on the record is the single biggest difficulty in this entire field because since World War II, our extremely good and sophisticated counterintelligence units that got us through World War II are exactly the people who took over at the request of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman. How do you keep all of this evolving from the press, the media, Congress, the Supreme Court and every other government agency?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. Yeah, okay. But thank you. Somewhere between now and the end of this day, I'd like somebody to describe for me the different nonhumans that have been observed and what the differences are and do they intermingle? I think we've not asked that question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. Well I can give you at least a short answer. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. One man who retired from the Defense Intelligence Agency who sought me out because of something I had published in one of my four books and he had been exposed to it but because everything is so compartmentalized on a need to know basis, he came to me as a reporter and it goes to the heart of what he said. He said, "My job when I was working for the Defense Intelligence Agency was to study and monitor the geopolitical territorial conflicts of three extraterrestrial biological entities who have been involved with this planet for at least 270 million years." He broke them down as blonde-haired, blue-eyed that we would not distinguish from the so-called archangels of history. The second group would be standing up reptoids and the third group would be a huge variety of what are called grays.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. Okay. And do they intermingle? Are they all separate?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. They do not get along. They do not get along.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. I would add, if I may, that research has pointed out even a greater variety than this. Depending on how you deal with abduction research, there is some of this that's fairly extensive. They would talk about insectoid-type creatures. And then let's not forget there are a large number of individuals who have had or claim to have, sometimes I think persuasively to be honest with you, some form of contact with other beings that is not physical. This is a very difficult subject to get one's hand on, but these stories do not go away. Who are these beings? Are they good, bad, and different to our fate is another issue we can discuss. In terms of interrelationships, you're asking exactly the kind of question that many researchers still would like to get to the bottom of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. Okay. Thank you. Tom, my time is up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. Yes, thank you. Jeffrey Torres, I was very interested in your testimony. You said something and I think I know what you meant, but you didn't exactly say it this way, so I'm going to ask you if this is what you meant. It's kind of a yes or no question. You said that what your father witnessed in terms of the maneuverability of a particular object defied the law of physics. Well, I don't think physics law, as we currently understand it, says that you can't move very, very quickly. There's no limit on acceleration or velocity to my understanding. Of course, Dr. Bartlett may be able to help us more than I can on that, but what I think you meant to say is it defies any technology we know that can achieve those kinds of accelerations and motions. Am I correct in understanding that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. Well, more than that, what he meant was that if there was a fighter pilot in that other aircraft, he would have died from the G-forces. There were so many extreme maneuvers that this thing had made. Actually, he was convinced that it was of alien origin. Because of that, he actually went to college for his aerospace engineering degree. Then he worked with Werner von Braun in the NASA space program under the Saturn and several of the moon launches.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. He ended up doing a PhD. He had so many questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. I have no question of his qualifications. It just was an impact on him. He just couldn't understand it. He wanted knowledge. He's wondering if there might be another extraterrestrial explanation of what he observed. It's interesting because— I need to reclaim my time, I'm sorry. It's an interesting answer. What I was going to tell you is out of all the people in my life I've encountered, my dad was a constant scientist. He was an atheist. He was just this total white-lane brain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. I appreciate it. Thank you. I believe that he was an outstanding scientist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. I'm going to turn to you and ask you this. Researchers have looked at a lot of things related to this. The maneuver abilities are certainly interesting. One of the reasons why I think there is skepticism that these objects have extraterrestrial origins is because of, I'll just put it bluntly, Einstein's relativity theory that nothing can go faster than the speed of light. What are the most compelling studies of people that could explain distance questions without suspending Einstein's theory of relativity, law of physics that's well accepted that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light? Mr. Cook, I'm very, very grateful you asked that question. First of all, I just want to mention that regarding atmospheric phenomena, atmospheric objects that seem to defy the laws of physics, but of course they don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. Nothing defies the laws of physics. The question was asked previously, why don't they make sonic booms? How do the piles withstand G-forces? All of this is related. I would just point out there was an outstanding study done years ago by a retired NASA scientist, Paul Hill, who was known throughout NASA as their go-to guy for UFOs. His exact question was how is it that UFOs do what they do? His conclusion in his study published posthumously in the 1990s called Unconventional Flying Objects of Scientific Analysis was that they do not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. If you assume, because nothing works aerodynamically, it doesn't make sense, but it makes sense if you factor in what he called field propulsion, that is a kind of anti-gravity. In fact, now what he couldn't figure out was what is the source of power for that. No one knows that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. But actually, he did an outstanding work. His mathematics is very sound, and I would simply recommend it to everyone. Now the distance problem has also been discussed by a number of scientists in the last generation. Probably most famously, the mathematician Miguel Alcubierre, who, the math on what he did seems to be very, very good according to physicists, essentially think warp drive and Star Trek in the sense that if you have a source of power significant enough, it is possible and has been demonstrated mathematically for a craft literally to kind of shrink the space ahead and elongate it behind. You're not violating Einstein's E equals MC squared. It is literally space itself. I am going to reclaim my time only for the reason to just get this last question to you. When you say that you are kind of using anti-gravity as a way of saying we don't have to suspend Einstein's first theory of relativity, but
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. if you do that, then you are suspending his second theory, the general gravitational theories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. So what I am asking, let me ask you this. Aren't there researchers out there that have put together concepts or statements or proposed theories that say, hey, if you travel at even 10% of the speed of light and if you have... Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, Stan and Friedman, who is here earlier this week, has discussed this at length. There is a gentleman named Paul LeVoillet, another named Thomas Vallone, both of whom have done a lot of work in electrogravitics. I think it is very sound and worth anyone's attention. Thank you. I see my time has expired. So we are going with you, Representative Fire. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. A man who may be able to know all these physics rules that I don't. Thank you all very much for your testimony. That there is a cloak of secrecy, I think, is undeniable. Like the symptoms of a very serious disease, if the doctor doesn't know the etiology of the disease, it becomes very difficult to treat the symptoms. How in the heck did we get here with this cloak of secrecy? You really can't treat the disease until you know how it was engendered. I appreciate your testimony, Mr. Dolan, very much. You suggested at least one possible etiology for this symptom of this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest another one that may give us the hope that it will be reversed. Because if you're right, and I hope you're not, but if you're right, there is no hope, or little hope, that they're going to reverse this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest another one. For 20 years before I came to
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. the Congress, I worked for the military in every capacity you can work for the military.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. Directly for them, captive Navy contractor, eight years for IBM. As an independent contractor, Roscoe Bartlett and Associates doing research work for the military. For the past 20 years until just four months ago, I was in the U.S. government, 20 years on the Armed Services Committee, 20 years interfacing with the leaders of our military and our government. I will tell you that I think that all of those that I have met make their decisions on the base of what they think is best for America. And I think that these decisions, I would like to believe that this decision, it was made very quickly after Roswell, was it not? Within a few hours, the decision was made that we were going to have a cloak of secrecy over this thing. Let me suggest that they made that cloak of secrecy because they thought that if they revealed the truth to the American people, they would be panicked. Like the panic
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. after War of the Worlds on radio with H.G. Wells. If that was in fact their, the etiology for this, then it becomes pretty easy to reverse it. Because now after all these years, there is no evidence that if they are extraterrestrials, there is no evidence that they are hostile.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. So now, all these years we have been trying to protect the American people from themselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. I am not sure I agree with that judgment, by the way, that they need to be protected from themselves. But all these years we have been protecting them because we knew better than they. But now obviously there is no threat because these people have been here for a very long time, if in fact they are extraterrestrials. So now we can come clean with the American people. How about that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. Wise words, sir. I agree with you. I think that the secret has its own momentum. It generates its own profitability. It generates its own bureaucracy. It generates its own need to continue, it seems to me. How do you tell the world that you have been lying for sixty plus years? I think you tell them, sir, because you thought that was what you had to do because you couldn't have the kind of panic that occurred after the War of the Worlds, this little thing on radio. Certainly we agree on this. And certainly I think we could say that in the very beginning the secrecy would have started precisely because it was not known. How could President Truman really know what he was dealing with? How could his advisors really know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. So it seems logical to me, and I am sure many people think about it, that you would say, wait a minute, let's get together, let's think about this, let's figure out what we have and we will come to a decision at a certain period of time. My own belief is that breakthroughs in understanding the technology were made, greed comes into the factor, money comes into the factor, power, and the incentive just goes away. I think that through the Eisenhower years at the very least it went away. How quickly, sir, did they know that there were entities, these biological entities? I hesitate to use that word "biological."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. It depends on what evidence you judge. There are leaked documents. I consider them legitimate by and large. These are housed. One of the witnesses here, Dr. Robert Wood, is one of the individuals who has discussed them. They are called the majestic documents. If you take them at face value, it has been known since very early on, since the 1940s, that there are other entities that are here, extraterrestrial biological entities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. The crafts could have been Soviet. We would have leaked anything about the Soviets. The entity certainly could not have been Soviet. If they knew about that, they knew very early this was extraterrestrial. They had to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. They had to. If they knew that, then they could have had a legitimate concern that this was made public, the public was going to panic. For the good of the public, they couldn't make it public. Is that a reasonable argument?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. World War II had just ended. The entire world was lying flat on its back, millions of homeless and hungry people. Everyone was just trying to get back to a sense of normalcy. I can only imagine how the US military would have responded to something this exotic dropping into their lap.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. If this is, in fact, the ideology, then there is some hope that they can now say, gee, we've been watching this for all these years. Obviously, you're not hostile. Yes, it is extraterrestrial.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. My opinion is that there will never ever be any momentum from the top to move this forward, but the good news is that they're not the only game in town. The fact is our society is changing as dramatically as it is, as rapidly as it is, and there will be something that will force their hand. I'm convinced of this and I think it will happen within a generation or less. At that point, that's when the battle for truth begins, not ends, because there will still be spin doctors and attempts. The CIA will never just walk away from the table just because we figure something out. They're not going to say, oh, here's all of our information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. The battle will continue, but at least it will be out in the open.
