143. Astrophysicists are saying these things are real and we're being ridiculed. That's all I have to say. Help this country. [Applause] Okay, we need to get going. I want to thank the panel very much and indicate to the members that we've got six minutes each for questioning. I will reserve my minutes and we'll reverse the order a bit here, so we're to Senator Grovel. Linda, would you, when this gentleman that was interviewed, and this would go to Richard also, when he was talking about that he saw an extraterrestrial being, was it dead or alive? So we had imprisoned this person or this being. Could you elaborate a little bit about that?

144. Many more than one. We have had many more than one. In this particular case, this was at Area 51 inside of the Papoose Mountain. If you look at a map, the inside of the Papoose Mountain at Area 51 is an installation, multi-leveled, hidden by the Papoose Mountain. Many people have leaked to me and to others about working there. And in there are offices, as we would recognize as offices, and his CIA boss and the man in the film and a couple of others were taken to one of these offices where there was a one way on the other side. I don't know because it's his point of view. Was it a mirror or was it a reflective glass, but nevertheless, the man you just heard was standing on this side of the glass looking at his boss in the room with, I believe it was two others. And then the gray alien was dressed in something like they had tried to make it look sort of American. It had on a t-shirt and as if they

145. had put clothes on it right at the last minute for this meeting. And it was telepathic and each mind in the room was communicated with telepathically. And he had a discussion later on with his boss. And the general impression was that the non-human was trying to answer their questions, but that it was very succinct and that they ask questions such as how many of you are here on this planet? There would be no answer. There would be other questions that were of a technical nature and there would be no answer. And yet, on other questions, they all clearly heard telepathic information.

## Speaker Group 5

149. I would just add, I recall the witness speaking about that and certainly it's exactly right, Linda, what he said to me. In terms of the one, very few specific answers this being allegedly gave, but to one, why are they here? There was not a direct answer except a reply that we are not hostile or thoughts to that effect.

## Speaker Group 6

150. When you say telepathic, that means that the being was communicating directly, understood the way our mind worked. Now, were we able to telepathically communicate with them or was it a one way street?
→ {"text": "當你說心靈感應時，意思是這個生物能夠直接溝通，理解我們意識的運作方式。那麼，我們能夠與他們進行心靈感應溝通嗎？還是這只是單向的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

151. I can add something here along those lines. And then humans by definition live in a mental island. And we're dealing with intelligences that not only can place thoughts, images, movies, symbols, directly into human minds very easily, they simultaneously upload information from human minds. And I have had the experience of talking with a man who was working for the Central Intelligence Agency when he had an interaction with one of these beings. There have been many, sir. And that his whole mission was to have the experience of the upload download telepathically with a being under a completely nonthreatening, totally organized fashion.
→ {"text": "我可以就這方面補充一些內容。人類本質上生活在一個意識孤島中。而我們面對的智慧生命不僅能夠輕易地將思想、影像、畫面、符號直接植入人類意識，同時還能從人類意識中上傳資訊。我曾經與一位任職於中央情報局的人交談過，當時他與其中一個這樣的生物進行了互動。這樣的案例有很多，先生。他的整個任務就是在完全無威脅、完全有組織的情況下，體驗與這個生物進行心靈感應的上傳與下載。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. And he told me that they had warned him that the process of the telepathic download upload usually disables humans, humans usually faint. And that he had the experience and the way he described it was he said, Linda, imagine seven feature films going through your mind at the same time with heat, temperature, sense, sound, all of the senses and more. And then overlying those seven feature films are three-dimensional gold symbols that we would relate probably to Sumerian cuneiform or Assyrian symbols. And that all of that goes through your head in a matter of what your brain, your human brain, not being able to interact but has a sense of very rapid time. And that when it's all over, as he said, if God asked me what had been downloaded into my mind, I could not tell you. But I know that everything that I have ever lived was uploaded. That is, frankly, the level of telepathic interaction that has

156. You talked about your father. Thank you very much for doing that. That he had kept the secret for years. How or why did he finally communicate the information to you and the family? Well, it started much later. He started organizing RAF Manston reunions. He so loved his squadron that he organized trips to England and cruises.
→ {"text": "你談到了你的父親。非常感謝你這樣做。他保守這個秘密多年。他最終是如何或為什麼將這個資訊告訴你和家人的？這是後來才開始的。他開始組織曼斯頓皇家空軍基地的同袍聚會。他非常熱愛他的中隊，所以組織了去英國的旅行和遊輪活動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "轉錄錯誤修正：RAF Manson → RAF Manston（曼斯頓皇家空軍基地）"}

157. And I met his buddies, by the way, and they were all just the greatest guys, a lot of them World War II veterans. And he would organize these trips. And, you know, I guess at this point he started trying to find out answers as to why this had happened to him. So he was asking his squadron mates. And I guess he felt a little comfortable at that point.
→ {"text": "順便說一下，我見過他的戰友們，他們都是非常棒的人，其中很多是二戰退伍軍人。他會組織這些旅行。我想在這個時候，他開始試圖找出為什麼這件事會發生在他身上的答案。所以他會問他的中隊同袍。我想他在那個時候感到稍微安心了一些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. He had been retired for a number of years. And he ran across Nick Pope and they were able to declassify the event. But it took many years after that that it was declassified.
→ {"text": "他已經退休多年了。他遇到了尼克·波普，他們能夠將這個事件解密。但之後又花了很多年才真正完成解密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "但在聚會之後，他開始談論這件事。不過他從未公開發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. And you know, as a matter of fact, I had no idea that this had happened, that he had carried that burden. And my grandfather and him were extremely tight. And he cried that he couldn't tell his own father because of that secret. And he didn't tell his soul. Can you imagine dog fighting like this fellow the other day from Peru and yet when he landed, the spooks that were there on the ground greeted him and said, hey, let's find out what that was.
→ {"text": "你知道，事實上，我完全不知道這件事發生了，他一直背負著那個重擔。我祖父和他關係非常親密。他哭著說因為那個秘密，他無法告訴自己的父親。他沒有告訴任何人。你能想像像前幾天來自祕魯的那位飛行員一樣進行纏鬥，然而當他降落時，地面上的情報員迎接他並說，嘿，讓我們來弄清楚那是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. Mr. Dolan, is there a way to put together people? For example, we've heard a lot over the last four and a half days about the number of pilots who have seen other kinds of vehicles that are not from the United States or from this world flying. Is there a way to get some of these pilots together? Are they willing to talk about what they saw? Do you know?

164. Thank you for the question. First of all, I would just repeat the name of the organization I mentioned earlier in my statement, NARCAP, which is the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomenon. I mention them because they are very rigorous, very scientific, very low key, very nonsensational, and deal precisely with these individuals that you're talking about and have done so for decades. There have been a number of cases in which we've had pilots go on the record. In fact, there's no lack of very good data and information out there. The problem is, unfortunately, that these individuals who are all sober and careful and, as you heard in the previous panel, still get ridiculed by the media. They get the tinfoil hat placed on them. This is something that none of us have found a way to get around that, no matter how rigorous we are. In my own work years ago when I started
→ {"text": "感謝您的提問。首先，我想重申我在稍早證詞中提到的組織名稱，NARCAP，即國家航空異常現象報告中心。我提到他們是因為他們非常嚴謹、非常科學、非常低調、非常不聳動，而且正是處理您所說的這些人員，並且已經這樣做了數十年。已經有許多案例是飛行員公開作證的。事實上，外界並不缺乏非常好的數據和資訊。問題是，不幸的是，這些人都很清醒謹慎，正如您在上一場聽證會中聽到的，仍然遭到媒體的嘲笑。他們被貼上陰謀論者的標籤。這是我們無論多麼嚴謹都找不到方法克服的問題。在我多年前開始自己的研究工作時", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. researching this phenomenon, I had this naive idea. Really, I did that. If I just did the most rigorous, careful, historical treatment of the phenomenon that I could, then that just might be the magic bullet, the bat that hits the ball out of the park. It didn't happen.

166. We keep trying. I would say that we're in an era now where global communication among researchers has improved and is improving. I am looking forward to, I think, the next few years where there really should be better coordination among groups in the United States and elsewhere to be able to put together events like this. I think more is better.
→ {"text": "我們持續努力。我想說的是，我們現在正處於一個研究者之間全球通訊已經改善並且正在改善的時代。我期待著，我想在未來幾年，美國和其他地方的團體之間應該有更好的協調，以便能夠舉辦像這樣的活動。我認為越多越好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. I think with the social media that there's a possibility that you might be able to do that. People seem to trust pilots. Rightfully or wrongfully, they trust pilots. They're the most logical group who fly all the time. We are back and forth across this country, across this world, that as they see what they've seen, it seems to me that there would be some validity. I mean, the public would accept that premise if enough of them got together and talked about it.
→ {"text": "我認為透過社交媒體，你們有可能做到這一點。人們似乎信任飛行員。無論對錯，他們信任飛行員。他們是最常飛行的合理群體。我們在這個國家、這個世界來回穿梭，當他們看到他們所看到的，對我來說似乎會有一定的可信度。我的意思是，如果有足夠多的飛行員聚在一起談論這件事，公眾會接受這個前提。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. When you add up enough of the near misses and encounters that are up in the air, it's startling.
→ {"text": "當你把空中發生的足夠多的近距離錯過和遭遇事件加總起來，這是令人震驚的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. I guess it's the accumulation of so many people that have talked to me off the record, who have died.

183. Who have died?
→ {"text": "已經去世的人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. That I was given a chance to talk to people who were in some sort of the end of their days and I'd either been sought out or I had been referenced. And when you were talking to people who are essentially on their deathbed and they are describing for you the interactions that they've had with extraterrestrial biological entities in the context of their professional capacity for the United States government, how would I question what they were saying to me?
→ {"text": "我有機會與那些處於生命末期的人交談，他們要麼主動找到我，要麼我被引薦給他們。當你與那些本質上已經臨終的人交談，而他們向你描述他們在美國政府職務背景下與外星生物實體的互動時，我怎麼能質疑他們對我說的話呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. Can I provide for you right here in this room one of the many different types of extraterrestrial biological entities? I cannot. Do I believe that these primarily male individuals who have shown to me at least enough evidence about where they worked publicly, which not always connects to where they get their paycheck, that they are telling me the truth about their life and their experiences with extraterrestrial biological entities, craft, technology, the physics that we have been encountering and stunned by?
→ {"text": "我能在這個房間裡為你提供眾多不同類型的外星生物實體之一嗎？我不能。我相信這些主要是男性的個人，他們向我展示了至少足夠的證據，證明他們公開工作的地方——這並不總是與他們領取薪水的地方相符——他們正在向我講述關於他們的生活以及他們與外星生物實體、飛行器、技術、我們一直遇到並感到震驚的物理學的真實經歷嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. I believe them. And I'm a long time TV producer and investigative reporter. And as I have said before, the challenge of getting people on the record is the single biggest difficulty in this entire field because since World War II, our extremely good and sophisticated counterintelligence units that got us through World War II are exactly the people who took over at the request of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman. How do you keep all of this evolving from the press, the media, Congress, the Supreme Court and every other government agency?
→ {"text": "我相信他們。我是一名資深的電視製作人和調查記者。正如我之前所說，讓人們公開作證是這整個領域中最大的困難，因為自二戰以來，我們那些極其優秀和精密的反情報單位——正是他們幫助我們度過了二戰——正是應富蘭克林·德拉諾·羅斯福和哈里·杜魯門的要求接管了一切的人。你如何阻止所有這些資訊從新聞界、媒體、國會、最高法院和所有其他政府機構洩漏出去？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. Yeah, okay. But thank you. Somewhere between now and the end of this day, I'd like somebody to describe for me the different nonhumans that have been observed and what the differences are and do they intermingle? I think we've not asked that question.

189. One man who retired from the Defense Intelligence Agency who sought me out because of something I had published in one of my four books and he had been exposed to it but because everything is so compartmentalized on a need to know basis, he came to me as a reporter and it goes to the heart of what he said. He said, "My job when I was working for the Defense Intelligence Agency was to study and monitor the geopolitical territorial conflicts of three extraterrestrial biological entities who have been involved with this planet for at least 270 million years." He broke them down as blonde-haired, blue-eyed that we would not distinguish from the so-called archangels of history. The second group would be standing up reptoids and the third group would be a huge variety of what are called grays.

192. I would add, if I may, that research has pointed out even a greater variety than this. Depending on how you deal with abduction research, there is some of this that's fairly extensive. They would talk about insectoid-type creatures. And then let's not forget there are a large number of individuals who have had or claim to have, sometimes I think persuasively to be honest with you, some form of contact with other beings that is not physical. This is a very difficult subject to get one's hand on, but these stories do not go away. Who are these beings? Are they good, bad, and different to our fate is another issue we can discuss. In terms of interrelationships, you're asking exactly the kind of question that many researchers still would like to get to the bottom of.

194. Yes, thank you. Jeffrey Torres, I was very interested in your testimony. You said something and I think I know what you meant, but you didn't exactly say it this way, so I'm going to ask you if this is what you meant. It's kind of a yes or no question. You said that what your father witnessed in terms of the maneuverability of a particular object defied the law of physics. Well, I don't think physics law, as we currently understand it, says that you can't move very, very quickly. There's no limit on acceleration or velocity to my understanding. Of course, Dr. Bartlett may be able to help us more than I can on that, but what I think you meant to say is it defies any technology we know that can achieve those kinds of accelerations and motions. Am I correct in understanding that?
→ {"text": "是的，謝謝。傑佛瑞·托雷斯，我對你的證詞非常感興趣。你說了一些話，我想我知道你的意思，但你沒有完全這樣說，所以我要問你這是否是你的意思。這有點像是是非題。你說你父親就某個物體的機動性所目睹的現象違反了物理定律。嗯，我認為就目前我們所理解的物理定律而言，並沒有說你不能移動得非常非常快。據我所知，加速度和速度是沒有限制的。當然，巴特利特博士在這方面可能比我更能幫助我們，但我認為你想說的是，它違反了我們所知的任何能夠實現那種加速度和運動的技術。我理解得對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. Well, more than that, what he meant was that if there was a fighter pilot in that other aircraft, he would have died from the G-forces. There were so many extreme maneuvers that this thing had made. Actually, he was convinced that it was of alien origin. Because of that, he actually went to college for his aerospace engineering degree. Then he worked with Werner von Braun in the NASA space program under the Saturn and several of the moon launches.
→ {"text": "嗯，不止如此，他的意思是，如果那架飛機裡有一名戰鬥機飛行員，他會因為G力而死亡。這個東西做了太多極端的機動動作。實際上，他確信它是外星起源的。正因為如此，他後來去大學攻讀航空工程學位。然後他與華納·馮·布勞恩在NASA太空計畫中合作，參與了土星計畫和幾次登月發射。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

196. He ended up doing a PhD. He had so many questions.

197. I have no question of his qualifications. It just was an impact on him. He just couldn't understand it. He wanted knowledge. He's wondering if there might be another extraterrestrial explanation of what he observed. It's interesting because— I need to reclaim my time, I'm sorry. It's an interesting answer. What I was going to tell you is out of all the people in my life I've encountered, my dad was a constant scientist. He was an atheist. He was just this total white-lane brain.
→ {"text": "我對他的資格沒有任何疑問。這只是對他產生了影響。他就是無法理解。他想要知識。他想知道對於他所觀察到的現象是否有另一種外星解釋。這很有趣，因為——我要收回我的時間，抱歉。這是一個有趣的答案。我想告訴你的是，在我一生中遇到的所有人的，我父親始終是一位科學家。他是無神論者。他就是這種完全理性的大腦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. I appreciate it. Thank you. I believe that he was an outstanding scientist.

199. I'm going to turn to you and ask you this. Researchers have looked at a lot of things related to this. The maneuver abilities are certainly interesting. One of the reasons why I think there is skepticism that these objects have extraterrestrial origins is because of, I'll just put it bluntly, Einstein's relativity theory that nothing can go faster than the speed of light. What are the most compelling studies of people that could explain distance questions without suspending Einstein's theory of relativity, law of physics that's well accepted that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light? Mr. Cook, I'm very, very grateful you asked that question. First of all, I just want to mention that regarding atmospheric phenomena, atmospheric objects that seem to defy the laws of physics, but of course they don't.

200. Nothing defies the laws of physics. The question was asked previously, why don't they make sonic booms? How do the piles withstand G-forces? All of this is related. I would just point out there was an outstanding study done years ago by a retired NASA scientist, Paul Hill, who was known throughout NASA as their go-to guy for UFOs. His exact question was how is it that UFOs do what they do? His conclusion in his study published posthumously in the 1990s called Unconventional Flying Objects of Scientific Analysis was that they do not.

202. But actually, he did an outstanding work. His mathematics is very sound, and I would simply recommend it to everyone. Now the distance problem has also been discussed by a number of scientists in the last generation. Probably most famously, the mathematician Miguel Alcubierre, who, the math on what he did seems to be very, very good according to physicists, essentially think warp drive and Star Trek in the sense that if you have a source of power significant enough, it is possible and has been demonstrated mathematically for a craft literally to kind of shrink the space ahead and elongate it behind. You're not violating Einstein's E equals MC squared. It is literally space itself. I am going to reclaim my time only for the reason to just get this last question to you. When you say that you are kind of using anti-gravity as a way of saying we don't have to suspend Einstein's first theory of relativity, but

Aren't there researchers out there that have put together concepts or statements or proposed theories that say, hey, if you travel at even 10% of the speed of light and if you have... Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, Stan and Friedman, who is here earlier this week, has discussed this at length. There is a gentleman named Paul LeVoillet, another named Thomas Vallone, both of whom have done a lot of work in electrogravitics. I think it is very sound and worth anyone's attention. Thank you.

How in the heck did we get here with this cloak of secrecy? You really can't treat the disease until you know how it was engendered. I appreciate your testimony, Mr. Dolan, very much. You suggested at least one possible etiology for this symptom of this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest another one that may give us the hope that it will be reversed. Because if you're right, and I hope you're not, but if you're right, there is no hope, or little hope, that they're going to reverse this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest another one.
