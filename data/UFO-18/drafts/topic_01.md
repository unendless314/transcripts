→ {"text": "向本委員會陳述。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "重複宣誓詞"}

8. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. Yes, and this is what's been -- well, this is, as I understand it, the truth embargo panel. Is that a fair statement of this panel?
→ {"text": "是的，這就是——據我所知，這是真相封鎖（truth embargo）小組。這樣描述這個小組是否恰當？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. Great. And a film, as I understand it?
→ {"text": "很好。還有一段影片，我這樣理解對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. Yes. Well, as we get older and older, I'm 77 right now. You can't live forever, you know. So if this procedure I'm going to have to clean the blood doesn't work, then I've got probably a few more months to make it before my kidneys shut down. So that's kind of why I'm kind of going along with the interview at this time.
→ {"text": "是的。隨著年紀越來越大，我現在77歲了。人不可能長生不老。所以如果我即將要做的血液淨化療程無效的話，大概再過幾個月我的腎臟就會衰竭。這就是為什麼我現在願意接受這次訪談的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. You're seeing that what you went through is just too important for people not to know about.
→ {"text": "您認為您所經歷的事情太重要了，不應該讓人們不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. Can you just -- can we start at the beginning with your military career and just walk through what exactly your experiences were?
→ {"text": "您可以從您的軍旅生涯開始說起嗎？讓我們從頭開始，詳細說明您究竟經歷了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. I was drafted into the military and got into the U.S. Army. After that, I was sent to the Signal Training Center in eastern United States.
→ {"text": "我被徵召入伍，進入美國陸軍。之後被派往美國東部的通信訓練中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. What year would this be? 1958. I went through the signal training course. And at that time, I went through the radio tele-type course and also the cryptography course, Crypto. They had five instructors that were getting out of military service, so they pulled the top five students. And I was third in the class, so I got pulled as an instructor.
→ {"text": "這是哪一年？1958年。我完成了通信訓練課程。當時我修了無線電電傳打字課程，還有密碼學課程（Crypto）。當時有五名教官即將退役，所以他們選了成績最好的五名學生。我在班上排名第三，所以被選為教官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "cryptography 譯為密碼學"}

19. Now, were you at this time also working yet for CIA?
→ {"text": "那麼，這個時候您也開始為 CIA 工作了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. No.
→ {"text": "還沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. Not yet?
→ {"text": "還沒有嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. No. After one day, my boss came to me and he said, "How would you like to, you know, make some extra money?" And I said, "Well, money is good." So he explained to me that I could -- he could put it through, like, would have to get a top secret White House cue clearance for the job, you know. And I thought, boy, must be a pretty exclusive thing, you know. And I said, "Well, what is this?" And he said that I'm director for the CIA for eastern United States, you know. And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that." And he said, "You weren't supposed to."
→ {"text": "還沒有。過了一天，我的上司來找我說：「你想不想賺點外快？」我說：「錢當然是好事。」於是他向我解釋說，要接下這個工作必須取得最高機密白宮 Q 級許可（top secret White House cue clearance）。我心想，這一定是個相當機密的任務。我問：「這是什麼工作？」他說他是 CIA 東部地區的主任。我說：「哦，我還真不知道。」他說：「本來就不應該知道。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": "top secret White House cue clearance 譯為最高機密白宮 Q 級許可"}

23. After about six weeks, my security clearance came through, and I got my CIA card. It was an ID card, like a credit card, where I could just go up to the door and slice it, walk right in. And my name at that time, I used an artificial name, too. Never used my real name. I started working with him on the project he was on. And that was Project Blue Book, which was kind of partially a fraud.
→ {"text": "大約六週後，我的安全許可通過了，我拿到了 CIA 證件。那是一張像信用卡一樣的身份證，我只需要到門口刷卡就能直接進去。那時我用的也是化名，從來沒用過真名。我開始和他一起從事他手上的專案，那就是藍皮書計畫（Project Blue Book），某種程度上算是個騙局。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Project Blue Book 譯為藍皮書計畫"}

24. You're saying some of the Blue Book cases were completely fictitious?
→ {"text": "您的意思是藍皮書計畫有些案例完全是虛構的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. Yes. But the cases that we got came from, I think it was Fort Belvoir, Maryland.
→ {"text": "是的。但我們收到的案件來自——我想是馬里蘭州的貝爾沃堡基地（Fort Belvoir）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. Fort Belvoir?
→ {"text": "貝爾沃堡基地？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. Yeah. And it didn't come from the Pentagon, or it didn't come from CIA headquarters. But we would get reports about a certain sighting that they had in Mexico or Italy or something like that. And then we had people that would follow through on it, that would go out and interview the people to see if they were not cases, or if it was real, you know.
→ {"text": "是的。不是從五角大廈來的，也不是從 CIA 總部來的。但我們會收到關於墨西哥或義大利等地目擊事件的報告。然後我們會派人去跟進，外出訪問目擊者，確認是誤報還是真實事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. So you'd be going overseas frequently?
→ {"text": "所以您會經常出國？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. I wasn't, but I always stayed statewide. But the people we had working with us from CIA would do that. We would get like a new report probably a couple times a week. I was coming into the Army fresh off the farm, you know, so I really didn't have much knowledge of anything. But my boss filled me in on Project Blue Book and what they had found so far, as far as the Greys and the aliens and the Roswell Incident.
→ {"text": "我沒有，我一直留在州內。但我們 CIA 的同事會去。我們大概每週會收到幾次新報告。我當時是從農場直接進入軍隊的，所以什麼都不太懂。但我的上司向我介紹了藍皮書計畫以及他們到目前為止的發現，包括灰人（Greys）、外星人以及羅斯威爾事件（Roswell Incident）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Greys 譯為灰人，Roswell Incident 譯為羅斯威爾事件"}

30. How did you feel when this first got dumped on you? When you first learned about this?
→ {"text": "這些事情第一次被告知您時，您有什麼感受？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. I was just kind of overwhelmed with all of this, you know. And I said to him, I don't know if I'm going to be able to be a judge of this type of thing. What's real, what's not, when I don't have much knowledge of it, you know.
→ {"text": "我當時有點被這一切淹沒了。我跟他說，我不知道自己能不能判斷這種事情，什麼是真的，什麼是假的，而我對這些又沒什麼了解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. So what did he say?
→ {"text": "那他怎麼說？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. He said, well, we have to build the information as we go and you'll see how this thing is working out.
→ {"text": "他說，我們必須邊做邊建立資訊，妳就會明白這件事是怎麼運作的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. And then the other thing is, of course, you really weren't able to tell family or close friends, obviously.
→ {"text": "另外當然是，妳顯然不能告訴家人或親密朋友。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. No, I couldn't tell anybody. In fact, I had to take a vow that I wouldn't tell anybody, a lot of it for 40 years and more of it for 50 years, which is up in 2010.
→ {"text": "不，我不能告訴任何人。事實上，我必須發誓保密，其中很多內容要保密40年，更多內容要保密50年，到2010年才到期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. You're doing all this crypto work. You're looking at images, photographs, video. It's 1958, maybe the fall of '58. What happened after this?
→ {"text": "妳做著所有這些密碼工作，看著圖像、照片、影片。那是1958年，可能是58年秋天。之後發生了什麼事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. At that time, the Project Blue Book thing kind of went pot, you know. If you remember, back in those days, they kind of declared it as a nothing, you know.
→ {"text": "那時候，藍皮書計畫那件事有點不了了之了。如果妳記得，那時候他們有點把它宣佈為什麼都不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. And they were telling the world, all UFOs are misidentifications, hoaxes, psychological issues, whatever.
→ {"text": "他們告訴全世界，所有 UFO 都是誤認、惡作劇、心理問題之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. Yes. So my boss came to me and he says, we've both got a new assignment. And he says, oh, I said, where are we going? Oh, he says, we're going to the Capitol. We're going to be part of the Eisenhower push. He's trying to find out something about, all about these aliens that MJ-12 was supposed to find out, but never sent back reports to him.
→ {"text": "是的。所以我的上司來找我說，我們都有新任務。我問，我們要去哪裡？他說，我們要去國會大廈。我們將成為艾森豪威爾行動的一部分。他試圖查明 MJ-12 應該要調查的那些外星人相關的一切，但他們從未向他提交報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. The MJ-12, the UFO control group, were they calling it MJ-12 at that time?
→ {"text": "MJ-12，那個 UFO 控制小組，那時候他們就叫它 MJ-12 嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. They called us in, went into the Oval Office, and President Eisenhower was there in Nixon, and they said, we called the people in from MJ-12, from Area 51 and S-4, but they told us that the government had no jurisdiction over what they were doing. So being a general, past general, you didn't tell them to go to hell without any real good reason, you know.
→ {"text": "他們召見我們，進入橢圓形辦公室，艾森豪威爾總統和尼克森都在，他們說，我們召見了 MJ-12、51區（Area 51）和 S-4 的人，但他們告訴我們政府對他們所做的事沒有管轄權。身為將軍、前任將軍，妳不會沒有充分理由就叫他們滾開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. So he said, I want you and your boss to fly out there. I want you to give them a personal message. He says, I want you to tell them, whoever is in charge, tell them that to get in, they have this week, coming week, to get into Washington and to report to me. And if they don't, I'm going to get the st Army from Colorado, and we're going to go over, we're going to take the base over, I don't care what kind of classified material you got, we're going to rip this thing apart.
→ {"text": "所以他說，我要妳和妳的老闆飛過去那裡。我要妳親自帶個訊息給他們。他說，我要妳告訴他們，不管是誰在負責，告訴他們這週，下週，必須到華盛頓來向我報告。如果不來，我就要從科羅拉多調第一軍過去，我們會過去接管那個基地，我不在乎妳們有什麼機密資料，我們會把整個地方翻過來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. Eisenhower was going to invade Area 51, yeah, with the 1st Army.
→ {"text": "艾森豪威爾打算入侵 51區，是的，用第一軍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. So you go out with your superior, you fly out, you land, what happens? Can you describe this whole process, what you saw?
→ {"text": "所以妳和妳的上司一起出發，飛過去，降落，然後發生了什麼？妳能描述整個過程嗎，妳看到了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. It took us the 13 or 15 miles south to S4, had like different garage door openings. And in these garage door openings, they had like different saucer crafts. The very first one had the Roswell craft in. It was kind of crashed up, but apparently every alien that was in it died except for a couple.
→ {"text": "我們向南走了13或15英里到 S-4，那裡有不同車庫門開口。在這些車庫門開口裡，他們有不同的碟形飛行器。第一個裡面就是羅斯威爾飛行器（Roswell craft）。它撞毀得相當嚴重，但顯然裡面的每個外星人都死了，除了幾個之外。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. So you see the Roswell craft, and what are some of the others that you see?
→ {"text": "所以妳看到了羅斯威爾飛行器，還有其他什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. Well, the Roswell craft was really strange, because it looked like real heavy aluminum foil. We could rock next to it, and you could rock, the whole thing probably weighed 150, 300 pounds.
→ {"text": "嗯，羅斯威爾飛行器真的很奇怪，因為它看起來像很厚的鋁箔。我們可以站在旁邊推它，你可以搖晃它，整個東西可能只有150到300磅重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. Could they tell what the source of power was of this craft?
→ {"text": "他們能分辨這個飛行器的動力來源嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. Yeah, it was like a river's gravitational thing of some kind. In fact, one, later on, I got the mathematical code for reversing gravity in a 3x5 card. I guess there are different types of grays and so on.
→ {"text": "是的，那像是某種反轉重力的裝置。事實上，後來我拿到一張3x5卡片，上面有反轉重力的數學公式。我猜還有不同類型的灰人等等。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文 'river's gravitational thing' 根據 terminology.yaml 應為 'reverse gravitational thing'，譯為反轉重力"}

51. How did you see that evidence?
→ {"text": "妳是怎麼看到那些證據的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. Well, later on at S4, we viewed the autopsy film. And then the colonel said, "What we've got in here is we're interviewing a gray alien."
→ {"text": "嗯，後來在 S-4，我們看了解剖影片。然後上校說：「我們現在在這裡要做的是訪問一個灰人（gray alien）。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. All right, right there. How did you feel at that moment?
→ {"text": "好的，就在那個時候。那一刻妳有什麼感受？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. Well, I thought, boy, we had no idea we were going to see真實的東西。我們只看了影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. You had to have a little bit of heart racing at that moment.
→ {"text": "那一刻妳一定心跳加速了吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. Yes. My boss was able to go in and had a partial interview with him.
→ {"text": "是的。我的老闆得以進去，並與他進行了部分訪談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. So what did this gray alien look like? Could you describe him a little bit?
→ {"text": "那麼這個灰人長什麼樣子？妳能描述一下嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. This one looked a little bit oriental.
→ {"text": "這個看起來有點東方人的樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

59. So I'm just wondering, if it looked almost human, what about this didn't look human?
→ {"text": "那我在想，如果它看起來幾乎像人類，那哪裡不像人類呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. No, it didn't look human as far as the skin tone and basically the shape of it and the size.
→ {"text": "不，就膚色、基本外形和大小來說，它看起來不像人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. How was its head size compared with a normal human, for example?
→ {"text": "比如說，它的頭部大小和正常人類相比如何？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. One was kind of a little bit bigger and some of them noses were very, very small and ears were just like holes. Mouth was very small.
→ {"text": "其中一個頭有點大一點，有些鼻子非常非常小，耳朵就像洞一樣。嘴巴也很小。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. Why were they bringing you out here at all anyway to see an alien? What was the point?
→ {"text": "他們為什麼要把妳帶來這裡看外星人？目的是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. To go back and tell the president they actually had one.
→ {"text": "為了回去告訴總統他們真的有一個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. So he did not know at this point if there was an alien at S4.
→ {"text": "所以當時他並不知道 S-4 是否真的有外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. What did you do then? Were you done or did you have other things to do at S4?
→ {"text": "那之後妳做了什麼？結束了還是在 S-4 還有其他事情？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. Yes, basically we were kind of done. We went back to Area 51. They took us into the main building and there we saw a U-2 which of course we didn't know existed and a model of the SR-71.
→ {"text": "是的，基本上我們算是結束了。我們回到 51區。他們帶我們進入主建築，在那裡我們看到了 U-2，當然那時我們根本不知道它的存在，還有 SR-71 的模型。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. The Blackbird.
→ {"text": "黑鳥式（Blackbird）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. But like I mentioned earlier, it was not a model of the current Blackbird, but an early version.
→ {"text": "但就像我剛才說的，那不是現在黑鳥式的模型，而是早期版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

70. Did you go directly to Washington after this or did you go somewhere else? Did you fly regular airline?
→ {"text": "之後妳直接回華盛頓還是去了別的地方？妳搭的是一般民航嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. We flew back to the commuter plane, back to the air base and then took President Eisenhower's Lockheed Electra back to Washington.
→ {"text": "我們飛回通勤飛機，回到空軍基地，然後搭乘艾森豪威爾總統的洛克希德 Electra 回華盛頓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

72. You and your supervisor, superior officer, and now you're meeting with the president?
→ {"text": "妳和妳的上司、長官，現在要去見總統？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. We met with him in the second story of the old OSS warehouse building. Eisenhower and Nixon were there and also Hoover was there. So he asked us what was going on and we told him about the alien and the whole situation and the black projects and so on. He was just totally shocked. He appeared for the first time to be worried, like he was worried.
→ {"text": "我們在舊 OSS 倉庫大樓的二樓見到他。艾森豪威爾和尼克森都在，胡佛也在。他問我們發生了什麼事，我們就告訴他關於外星人、整個情況以及黑計畫等等。他完全震驚了。他第一次顯露出擔憂的樣子，就像他真的在擔心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "OSS 譯為戰略情報局"}

75. I would think that Eisenhower would, I mean he certainly knew that flying saucers were real.
→ {"text": "我以為艾森豪威爾——我的意思是，他當然知道飛碟是真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. They were aliens. So I guess I'm just wondering what would he have been really surprised about?
→ {"text": "它們是外星人。所以我想知道，他究竟會對什麼感到驚訝？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. Surprised about the black programs. Eisenhower said, "I've got to keep this thing completely secret. I can't talk about this."
→ {"text": "對黑計畫感到驚訝。艾森豪威爾說：「我必須把這件事完全保密。我不能談論這個。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. Your actual name, the name you grew up with, that was a different name than what you had in the...
→ {"text": "妳的真名，妳從小用的名字，和妳在……用的不同？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. I never used it in the CIA at all.
→ {"text": "我在 CIA 從來沒用過真名。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. Now what about today? You're going on the public record and this is still sensitive information even though earlier you talked about security oaths that maybe expire after a certain period of time. 50 years.
→ {"text": "那現在呢？妳要公開作證，這仍然是敏感資訊，儘管妳剛才說保密誓言會在一定時間後到期，50年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. But you're still concerned.
→ {"text": "但妳還是擔心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. I had a Linda Moulton Howe phone call. Her phone was tapped and they got my phone number and through the telephone company they were able to find me and so on.
→ {"text": "我曾經和琳達·莫爾頓·豪（Linda Moulton Howe）通過電話。她的電話被監聽了，他們得到了我的電話號碼，透過電話公司找到了我等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. When they found you, what happened?
→ {"text": "他們找到妳的時候，發生了什麼事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. I was going to a grocery store. Two guys in black suits came out of a black Lincoln town car and came over to see me and they told me that I better not publish anything or talk to Linda about any more things. So at that time, I did. I stopped.
→ {"text": "那時候我正要去雜貨店。兩個穿黑西裝的人從一輛黑色林肯房車出來，過來找我，他們告訴我最好不要發表任何東西，也不要再跟琳達談任何事了。所以那時候我就照做了。我停止了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. That was enough to intimidate you.
→ {"text": "那足以恐嚇妳了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. I'd rather remain anonymous. Never show my face on anything.
→ {"text": "我寧願保持匿名。絕對不要在任何地方露臉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. Really thank you for doing this.
→ {"text": "真的很感謝您願意這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. Yes. This was, I guess, kind of a good idea because I feel much better having talked about it. I kind of feel like there's a load off my shoulders.
→ {"text": "是的。我想這是個好主意，因為說出來之後我感覺好多了。我感覺肩上的重擔放下了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. Really?
→ {"text": "真的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. Yes. Because I had an awful lot of secrets that I had kept over the years.
→ {"text": "是的。因為我這些年來保守了太多秘密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
