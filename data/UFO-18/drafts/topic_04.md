## Speaker Group 1

123. Thank you. You are, the last two witnesses have been particularly good at keeping it right within the time limit. We sure appreciate that. Jeffrey Torres, you've got 10 minutes.

124. My pleasure. Well, good day to everybody. My name is Jeffrey Torres. I'm not going to talk about myself much. I'm a veteran. I served the United States Air Force. I'm talking here today about my father. I'm the son of Major Milton John Torres. My father served in the U.S. Air Force from 1951 to 1971, and regrettably, my father cannot attend this hearing as he is now suffering from ill health directly related to combat from the Vietnam War. I told him before I left that I was coming on his behalf, and he expressed his deep gratitude that I was coming here today to testify and tell you folks his story. First of all, I would like to give you a brief history of who my father was and his accomplishments.

125. Dad earned a bachelor's degree in general engineering with a minor in chemistry, and completed his master's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1961. His military career was spent over the span of 20 years. Dad served as a fighter pilot, flying the F-86D, and according to him, the best airplane ever made, as well as the F-100. He was a decorated pilot, achieving the title of USAF command pilot. Dad flew over 300 combat missions in Vietnam as a forward air controller in Vietnam. He received 13 air medals, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, and I know firsthand that he was even put in for the Air Force Cross, which he denied because of political reasons, which we'll not get into here. My father attained a rank of major, as well as during his career he also worked with NASA as a chief of range control for the Gemini and Apollo Moon missions.

126. After Dad retired from the United States Air Force, Dad worked for Pan Am as an engineer, and later acquired his doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of Miami.

127. My father's last job was as a professor at Florida International University teaching engineering.

128. During his tenure at FIU, he invented a chemical encoding process using a polymer to prevent catastrophic metal fatigue on aircraft and received a patent for that process. Dad retired from FIU in 2004. So now we'll go on to Dad's story and the event that happened. I will go into some details he shared with our family, but before I do, I want to point out something here. That my father, he kept his secret for over 50 years. He never told anyone and he honored his oath to this country. And he never had the chance to tell his story to my grandfather, his father who he loved very, very much. And I've never seen my father cry until this story broke. Sadly, my father kept it all from everyone, including us and my family. Not even telling his father's story when he was the closest man that he ever had. I know Dad would never have discussed this event if not for it being declassified by the Minister of Defense, Nick

129. Pope, out of the UK. After the event was declassified, Dad shared the story often with us. It was May 20th, 1957. Dad was stationed at RAF Manston, England. Dad was working on intercept standby.

130. Of course, this was a cycle between the pilots in this particular event. It was Dad's turn.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. Dad was again flying the F-86D. This aircraft was a D model, which meant it was an all-weather fighter. Dad told me that the RAF Manston was a main intercept squadron during the Cold War in England. Dad was on alert with his wingman and some of the ground crew in the ready room. That night was a typical English night with the weather being poor and foggy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. The notification came down from the ready room indicating a scramble. Dad ran for his plane. The scramble was initiated. Dad jumped in his cockpit. If you could please, I put the photo of Dad's aircraft, if anybody would like to see the airplane. I have one saved on there. Anyhow, so he jumped in his cockpit upon getting the authentication code to fire.

133. He then realized that this was no drill. They normally would never give you an authentication code, and they told him it was a hot mission. He had orders to shoot this thing down. Dad told me whatever this thing was, they wanted it down, and he thought he was starting World War III. All kinds of thoughts were in his head. The intercept controller ordered Dad to fire a full salvo of 24 rockets at this object. Dad later told me that he knew full well how serious this event was. Dad was in his aircraft. His aircraft came to life, and he was given an order to go gate, which meant full afterburners were to be used after getting airborne. Dad said, "Do you want me to continue with the afterburners? Affirmative. Go gate."

134. In other words, they wanted him to close in on this thing, and they wanted him there fast.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. Dad was told to vector over to the North Sea. The object had been sighted hovering over East Ipswich. Dad told me he had a confirmation of the target acquisition from the ground radar. His jet flying with full afterburners was now headed towards the North Sea, and Dad was flying at 32,000 feet, and full afterburner and heavy cloud cover with zero visibility.

136. However, his radar was painting a target as big as an aircraft carrier at that altitude.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. Dad was fast approaching the target, and the object kept pulling in front of him just beyond range. It was toying with him. Finally, he was able to get his radar lock on the object.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. Dad said this thing was huge, and the blip was so big that it was easy to get target acquisition. Right before he got the instruction to fire from the radar control set, the target made an erratic side-to-side movement and moved beyond range, causing Dad to lose lock on his target. The object then accelerated from zero to Mach 10 in seconds, and Dad was unable to fire as a result. He lost complete lock. Dad told me his radar, his wingman's radar and the ground radar confirmed it as well. They had lost lock, and they were totally perplexed as to what happened. So, to make a long story short, the most compelling thing Dad said was that this thing was doing things that an ordinary aircraft could do. It was defying the laws of physics, and he was convinced that it was of alien origin. Anyhow, during that time, there was nothing in the Air Force that could come close to it. The F-86 could

139. barely make Mach .98 Mach. It would make Mach 1 in its complete dive at the time, and this thing did Mach 10. There was no known aircraft that could do this. So, upon landing his aircraft, Dad was contacted by the intercept officer on a secure phone. The person on the line told him that what happened was considered classified, and not to discuss this with anyone, from his wingman to his commander. He would be debriefed in the morning. Dad told me he realized how lucky he was, as if he did manage to fire at this object, he probably would have vaporized him. Off the record, he was scared shitless. So, he did tell me that the following day, Dad reported for duty, a call came in from a man that was from the NSA, and that he called him a spook. For us, it was much more personal, this whole event, because the spook came in, and swore Dad to secrecy that he would never, ever repeat what

140. he'd seen, and it was a matter of national security. The guy showed his credentials, he locked himself in a room with Dad for about a half hour, and threatened to pull his wings, and everything else that he held dear, including, you know, God knows his family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. The witness has about one more minute. Okay, I'll make it short. You know, my Dad waited 40 years for this, and forgive me. I'll make it quick here. You know, guys like my Dad are heroes. Guys like Edgar Mitchell. When I was a kid, I watched these guys from the side of the beach watching the Apollo moon launches, and now we're riding with the Russians to the moon now. We can't even go ourselves anymore. And yet, the media has blasphemized these great men. You know, how can they? How dare them? How dare them, and how dare everybody stay silent here? When people like my Dad held this secret, people who died and that never could tell a secret in Vietnam. It's a shame. It's a real shame that our media has bought and paid for by the Kardashians and the corporate industries of this country and the world. And this truth needs to come out because there's a lot of
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. people, including my family, who suffered and ridiculed. My father got ridiculed, my brother took phone calls from ridiculing people, and my Dad had a Ph.D. What more do they want?
