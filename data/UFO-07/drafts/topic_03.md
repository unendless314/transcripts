263. Sergeant Scott.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. I'm Tech Sergeant David Charles Scott, United States Air Force Security Police, retired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. At the time of my sighting, I was an Airman First Class with a secret security clearance and was assigned to Alpha Flight 91st Missile Security Squadron, Strategic Air Command, Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. November, 1974. It was after midnight when Airman Bill Gray, a member of my security alert team, and I were dispatched from Alpha 1 Launch Control Facility to an alarm situation at one of our 10-minute manned nuclear missile sites.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. Probably just another jackrabbit setting off an outer zone alarm, we thought.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. As we drove there, Gray spotted a strange light in the night sky, called it to my attention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. It appeared to be about the size of a star in the sky, but was pulsating red.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. We checked the site and found everything secure. Gray said the strange light had gotten bigger and acted weird when I was below.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. Then we parked our vehicle off-site to await the alarm system to reset and the order which would allow us to leave the area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. Now the strange light in the sky was pulsating and changing color in a sequence red, blue, and yellow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. Suddenly our radio went dead and the idling engine of our vehicle quit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. Gray and I sat there on guard duty for 45 minutes, protecting our missile site.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. We wondered aloud if the strange light above was a UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. When the light changed to white and pulsated three times and in quick succession, it disappeared and our engine came to life as the radio also came back on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. As it did, Sergeant Hicks, our flight security controller, called and ordered us back to Alpha 1.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. All alarms had reset properly back at the missile site.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. We arrived back at Alpha 1 a little after three in the morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. We reported our story to Sergeant Hicks about the strange light.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. We wanted to convince him that we had not fallen asleep on duty or we weren't drunk.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. He said, "I believe you, men."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. Then Sergeant Hicks hit us with a bombshell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. All Minuteman nuclear missile site alarms in our wing had sounded simultaneously.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. Many security police and security alert teams reported seeing the strange lights, which Gray and I saw, and they too lost radio communication and vehicle power.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. "You know what I think?" Gray asked. "I think it was a UFO."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. Sergeant Hicks just nodded.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. I ventured. "Should we report it? Gray and I aren't lying. We'll write statements."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. Gray signaled his agreement with a nod.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. Sergeant Hicks said, "Why stir up a lot of trouble?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. The official Air Force position is that UFOs don't even exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. Let's just drop it unless you two want to get laughed out of this service."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. A few nights later, in the security police barracks back at Minot Air Force Base, I was listening to a news broadcast from Winnipeg, Canada, radio station.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. The announcer read the story of an incident which had occurred just a few nights before, and fighter planes of the Canadian Air Force had scrambled to pursue the UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. The fighters tracked it until it climbed at a steep angle and, with blazing speed, disappeared.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. The Canadians responded to the UFO that was over our missile site.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. When that UFO, when that strange light disappeared, the Canadians picked up on it because the reporter on the radio then stated the United States Air Force would release the report on this incident and it would be released in May of 1975.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. But the day came and went without official comment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. And as far as I know, the U.S. Air Force has never officially recognized that event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. Completed, sir? You're complete? Thank you very much, Sergeant Scott. Thank you. Very riveting and thank you for your service as well. Now, Captain, I won't even try to pronounce your name. Please say it for us.
