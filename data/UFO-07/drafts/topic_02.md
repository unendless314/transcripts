→ {"text": "我被告知永遠不要再談論這起事件，並且被告知就我而言，它從未發生過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. Because of that, I am before you today with a bit of trepidation.

190. I must say a lot of trepidation, as I have never before shown my face in person on this matter.
→ {"text": "我必須說是相當大的惶恐，因為我此前從未就此事親自露面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. I was a Minuteman ICBM launch control officer, a first lieutenant, and a deputy missile combat crew commander in a two-man launch control, launch crew with my crew commander who held the rank of captain.
→ {"text": "我是一名民兵洲際彈道導彈 (Minuteman ICBM) 發射控制官，當時是少尉軍銜，擔任副導彈戰鬥組指揮官，與我的組長（上尉軍銜）組成兩人發射控制組。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. He was about 15 years older than I. I held a top secret clearance, which was required for my job.
→ {"text": "他比我大約年長 15 歲。我持有最高機密許可，這是我工作所必需的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. It all began one morning when I was watching TV while having breakfast, and I heard the local news announcer mention that some residents in the town of Mohall, North Dakota had seen strange lights overnight, which they attributed to a UFO.
→ {"text": "這一切始於某天早上，我在吃早餐時看電視，我聽到當地新聞播報員提到北達科他州莫霍爾鎮 (Mohall) 的一些居民在夜間看到奇怪的光點，他們認為是 UFO。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Mole Hall 錯誤"}

194. This caught my attention because I was scheduled for duty that morning at a launch control facility called November Flight, about three miles west of Mole Hall, and about 37 miles north of Minot, North Dakota.
→ {"text": "這引起了我的注意，因為我當天早上被安排在一個名為 November 飛行中隊的發射控制設施值勤，位於莫霍爾以西約 3 英里，邁諾特以北約 37 英里。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Minut 錯誤"}

195. I lived in the town of Minut at the time, and I drove to the air base to attend the morning pre-departure crew briefing at Wing headquarters, where all 15 missile crews would normally meet each day prior to pulling alert duty at the respective launch control facilities.
→ {"text": "當時我住在邁諾特鎮，我開車前往空軍基地參加聯隊總部的早晨出發前組員簡報，在那裡所有 15 個導彈組員通常每天在前往各自的發射控制設施執行警戒任務之前會面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Wigan 為 Wing headquarters"}

196. During that pre-departure crew briefing, it was mentioned that some missiles at November Flight had gone off alert, but there was no further information provided.
→ {"text": "在出發前簡報期間，有人提到 November 飛行中隊的一些導彈已經脫離警戒狀態，但沒有提供進一步的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我立即將這與我早上稍早聽到的關於莫霍爾鎮附近可能目擊 UFO 的新聞聯繫起來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "簡報結束後，坐在我附近的幾個發射組員評論了他們那天早上也聽到的新聞報導，並推測可能與 November 飛行中隊有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. My crew commander had also heard the news item, and we were both anxious and quite curious about what we might find as we drove out to the launch control facility.
→ {"text": "我的組長也聽到了這則新聞，當我們開車前往發射控制設施時，我們都既焦慮又相當好奇會發現什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. If you could display my second slide.

201. On this second slide, I don't believe you members have a picture of this, but you can see it on the screen here.
→ {"text": "在這張第二投影片上，我不認為各位委員手上有這張圖片，但各位可以在這裡的螢幕上看到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. This is the November launch control facility from an air view from Google Earth.
→ {"text": "這是從 Google Earth 空中視圖看到的 November 發射控制設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. There is an access road to the facility from the north coming down to the flight facility, where there's a main gate at the perimeter fence.
→ {"text": "從北邊有一條通往該設施的通道，通向飛行設施，在圍欄處有一個主要入口。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. The perimeter fence goes around the launch control facility building topside, and there's a garage to the right of the main gate.
→ {"text": "圍欄環繞著地面的發射控制設施建築，主入口右側有一個車庫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. The usual procedure upon arrival was to inspect the grounds and building, but this time my commander immediately went into the security section of the building to debrief security personnel and guards.
→ {"text": "通常抵達時的程序是檢查場地和建築，但這次我的組長立即前往建築的安全部門，向安全人員和警衛聽取匯報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. The security center was the topmost north side of the building near the main gate.
→ {"text": "安全中心位於建築的最北端，靠近主入口。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. I entered the facility from the back door at the end of the facility and then encountered the site manager, a tech sergeant, who immediately took me into the day room and asked if I had been briefed on the previous night's events.
→ {"text": "我從設施末端的後門進入，然後遇到了現場經理，一名技術士官，他立即帶我進入休息室，並問我是否已聽取了前一晚事件的簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. I said I hadn't.
→ {"text": "我說我沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. We then proceeded toward the windows on the west side of the day room, where he described to me the large object with flashing lights that had been hovering just outside the fence that night, and he spread his arms out in front of him to indicate its size, the size of the object.
→ {"text": "然後我們走向休息室西側的窗戶，他向我描述那天晚上在圍欄外懸停的帶有閃光燈的大型物體，他在面前張開雙臂來表示它的大小，物體的大小。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. Based on his description, I estimated the object may have been 80 to 100 feet wide and approximately 100 feet from the building, maybe a bit closer.
→ {"text": "根據他的描述，我估計該物體可能寬 80 到 100 英呎，距離建築約 100 英呎，也許更近一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. I immediately asked if it had been a helicopter, and he said that it just hovered with no noise being heard, quite unlike the usual noisy helicopters heard from within the building.
→ {"text": "我立即問是否是直升機，他說它只是懸停著沒有任何聲音，與從建築內通常聽到的嘈雜直升機聲完全不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. I also asked what the flashing lights were like, but he could not answer.
→ {"text": "我還問閃光燈是什麼樣子的，但他無法回答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. They were unlike any he had ever seen.
→ {"text": "它們與他見過的任何東西都不一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. They were not like the usual beacon lights on planes, but something like a pulsating glow.
→ {"text": "它們不像飛機上通常的信標燈，而是像一種脈動的光芒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. He then said the object, while hovering close to the ground, then glided to the right toward the north end of the building and out of sight.
→ {"text": "然後他說，該物體在靠近地面懸停時，向右滑向建築的北端並消失在視線之外。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. The object then came into view from the security section of the facility and hovered just behind and slightly to the right of the main gate.
→ {"text": "該物體然後從設施的安全部門進入視線，懸停在主入口的正後方稍右側。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. Concealed partly by the large garage located within the fenced area to the right of the gate.
→ {"text": "部分被位於圍欄區域內主入口右側的大型車庫遮擋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. As you can see there, the garage is labeled, the second position of the object.
→ {"text": "如各位所見，車庫被標示出來，這是物體的第二個位置。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. This location put the object almost directly above the hardened launch control capsule, located 60 feet below ground.
→ {"text": "這個位置使該物體幾乎正好位於地下 60 英呎的加固發射控制艙室正上方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. All our missiles, our 10 missiles, were located 4 to 14 miles away from the launch control facility.
→ {"text": "我們所有的導彈，我們的 10 枚導彈，都位於距離發射控制設施 4 到 14 英里的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. This capsule was located approximately underneath the garage.
→ {"text": "這個艙室大約位於車庫正下方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. This was the launch crew quarters and the launch control center for all 10 interconnected nuclear-tipped missiles that were located away from the launch facility.
→ {"text": "這是發射組員宿舍和發射控制中心，負責控制所有 10 枚相互連接的核彈頭導彈，這些導彈位於遠離發射設施的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. Security personnel confirmed everything that the site manager had related to me.
→ {"text": "安全人員證實了現場經理向我講述的一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. My commander and I then proceeded to take the elevator down to the launch control center, the capsule, to relieve the two-man officer crew below.
→ {"text": "我和我的組長隨後乘電梯下到發射控制中心，也就是艙室，以接替下面的兩人軍官組。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. After entering the capsule, our eyes were immediately transfixed on the launch control console, which showed that all missiles were off alert and unlaunchable.
→ {"text": "進入艙室後，我們的目光立即被發射控制台吸引住，它顯示所有導彈都脫離警戒狀態且無法發射。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. We had never seen such a thing before.
→ {"text": "我們以前從未見過這樣的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. The outgoing crew briefed us on the wild events that transpired overnight and indicated that the missiles malfunctioned at the time the object was hovering directly above the capsule and next to the main gate.
→ {"text": "即將離開的組員向我們簡報了整夜發生的瘋狂事件，並指出導彈故障發生在物體直接懸停在艙室上方和主入口旁邊的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. We speculated on the possibility of an EMF pulse that might have created the situation.
→ {"text": "我們推測可能是電磁脈衝造成了這種情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. We had no doubt, however, that the 10 outlying nuclear-tipped missiles of November flight had been compromised, tampered with, and put out of commission by the object that had paid a visit.
→ {"text": "然而，我們毫不懷疑，November 飛行中隊的 10 枚外圍核彈頭導彈已被造訪的物體破壞、篡改並使其失去作用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. Normally, it was quite unusual to have even one missile down, except for maintenance, and Wing headquarters was very proud of having more than 95 percent uptime for all 150 missiles of the Wing.
→ {"text": "通常來說，除了維修之外，即使有一枚導彈失效都是相當不尋常的，聯隊總部非常自豪地保持著聯隊所有 150 枚導彈超過 95% 的運行時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. The following morning, after we had been relieved by the follow-on crew, we arrived Hopside, and I attempted to further query the flight security controller who had been on duty at the time of the situation.
→ {"text": "隔天早上，在我們被接班組接替後，我們回到地面，我試圖進一步詢問當時值勤的飛行安全管制員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. But he interrupted me, and he said that he had been instructed not to discuss the incident.
→ {"text": "但他打斷了我，說他已被指示不得討論這起事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. That is when my commander then told me that he had received a call while I was on a scheduled respite break down below, and he told me -- and he was told that we were never to discuss the incident.
→ {"text": "就在那時，我的組長告訴我，他在我在下面進行預定的休息時接到了一通電話，他告訴我——他被告知我們永遠不得討論這起事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. When I asked where the directive came from, he said the OSI.
→ {"text": "當我問指令來自哪裡時，他說是 OSI（特別調查辦公室）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. He evidently received a call from the OSI.
→ {"text": "他顯然接到了 OSI 的電話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. With no discussion allowed on the subject, between him and me together, or with anybody else, my crew commander and I were left in limbo and left on our own to conjure in our own minds how other situations might unfold and be handled.
→ {"text": "在不允許討論這個主題的情況下，無論是我們之間還是與其他任何人，我的組長和我都被置於不確定的狀態，只能靠自己在腦海中想像其他情況可能如何展開和處理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. Normally, the Air Force would train us on all procedures.
→ {"text": "通常，空軍會對我們進行所有程序的訓練。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. We were in a simulator constantly training.
→ {"text": "我們不斷在模擬器中進行訓練。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. This serious lack of follow-through by the Air Force was more than bewildering, and it served to keep this situation on our minds.
→ {"text": "空軍這種嚴重缺乏後續處理的做法不僅令人困惑，而且使這個情況一直縈繞在我們心頭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. Together, there were a dozen of us involved with this incident.
→ {"text": "總共有十幾個人參與了這起事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. My commander and I were not there during the encounter, but we had to deal with the ramifications of the incident, and I'll never forget the frightened emotion on the faces of topside airmen who were gathered with me when I was briefed by the site manager.
→ {"text": "我的組長和我在遭遇時不在場，但我們必須處理事件的後果，我永遠不會忘記當現場經理向我簡報時，與我聚在一起的地面空軍人員臉上的恐懼表情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. Besides those of us at the launch control facility, there had to be many more people involved with this, including maintenance people who had to retarget and reline the missiles, also additional security personnel to guard and protect the missile launch facilities, and who knows how many others on base were concerned.
→ {"text": "除了我們這些在發射控制設施的人之外，肯定還有更多人參與其中，包括必須重新瞄準和重新校準導彈的維修人員，以及負責守衛和保護導彈發射設施的額外安全人員，還有誰知道基地上還有多少其他相關人員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. Everyone had been silenced. The incident was never discussed, and I never heard a word of any other incident from people that I associated with.
→ {"text": "每個人都被噤聲了。這起事件從未被討論過，我從與我交往的人那裡從未聽說過任何其他事件的消息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. I never spoke a word about my incident for almost 40 years, and my wife never knew.
→ {"text": "我近 40 年來從未談論過我的事件，我的妻子從不知情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. After several years of searching the Internet in the hopes of finding someone who would give me a clue about my incident, I then found what was described by Captain Robert Salas, and I felt immediate joyous freedom from my haunting memory.
→ {"text": "經過數年在網路上搜尋，希望找到能給我關於我事件線索的人，我找到了羅伯特·薩拉斯上尉所描述的內容，我立即感到從縈繞心頭的記憶中獲得了解脫的喜悅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. I then informed my wife.
→ {"text": "然後我告訴了我的妻子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. Since then, I have run across several missileers from my days at Minot who were there with me in the wing, and two of them have gone public with their own experiences.
→ {"text": "從那以後，我遇到了幾位與我一起在邁諾特服役的導彈軍官，他們當時與我在聯隊中，其中兩人已公開講述他們自己的經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. Two others have described to me their unique experiences, but they have pleaded that I not divulge their names.
→ {"text": "另外兩人向我描述了他們獨特的經歷，但他們懇求我不要透露他們的名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. They fear losing their first pension, are losing their personal integrity and keeping it secret, or have been ridiculed.
→ {"text": "他們害怕失去退休金、失去個人誠信而保守秘密，或者被嘲笑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. I also know of two other officers involved in incidents, but they will not admit to their secret, probably for the same reasons.
→ {"text": "我還知道另外兩名參與事件的軍官，但他們不會承認他們的秘密，可能是出於同樣的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. And then there's the late Captain Val Smith of my squadron, who is mentioned in official documents released by FOIA.
→ {"text": "還有我中隊已故的瓦爾·史密斯上尉 (Captain Val Smith)，他在根據資訊自由法 (FOIA) 公布的官方文件中被提及。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 FIA 錯誤"}

252. He was interviewed by the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek of Blue Book fame, who wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post, published on 17 December 1966, which described the incident that Smith was involved with on 25 August 1966.
→ {"text": "他接受了已故的藍皮書計畫知名人物 J·艾倫·海尼克博士 (Dr. J. Allen Hynek) 的訪談，海尼克在 1966 年 12 月 17 日出版的《週六晚郵報》(Saturday Evening Post) 上寫了一篇文章，描述了史密斯在 1966 年 8 月 25 日參與的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Alan Heineck 錯誤"}

253. Heineck stated in the article, "This incident was not picked up by the press.
→ {"text": "海尼克在文章中表示：「這起事件沒有被媒體報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. It is typical of the puzzling cases that I have studied during the 18 years that I have served as the Air Force's scientific consultant on the problem of UFOs."

256. Just prior to release of this post article, the Minot Daily News got wind of it, and then published on 6 December 1966, a front page news item with major bold headline that read, "Minot Launch Control Center Saucer, Cited as One Indication of Outer Space Visitors."
→ {"text": "就在這篇郵報文章發表前，《邁諾特每日新聞》(Minot Daily News) 得知此事，並於 1966 年 12 月 6 日在頭版以粗體大標題刊登新聞，標題為：「邁諾特發射控制中心飛碟，被引用為外太空訪客的一個跡象。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. The front page. I remember this article. I thought, "Oh, maybe I could start talking."
→ {"text": "頭版。我記得這篇文章。我想：「哦，也許我可以開始談論了。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. In 1966, when I was at Minot, the evidence was everywhere that something quite unique was happening.
→ {"text": "1966 年，當我在邁諾特時，到處都有證據顯示某種相當獨特的事情正在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. But I was embedded in a shell of silence.
→ {"text": "但我被嵌入在沉默的外殼中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. The Air Force knew the truth. The Air Force knew that I knew the truth, and that is the only reason they warned and instructed me that it never happened.
→ {"text": "空軍知道真相。空軍知道我知道真相，這是他們警告並指示我說這件事從未發生的唯一原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
