504. We're now going to open it to our members, and we're going to start with Congressman Bartlett.
→ {"text": "我們現在將開放給委員會成員提問，我們將從巴特利特眾議員 (Congressman Bartlett) 開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

505. As I've sat and listened to this testimony, I was asking myself a question. If for my good, there is a cover-up of these sightings, then what else might the government do for my good?
→ {"text": "當我坐在這裡聆聽這些證詞時，我在問自己一個問題。如果為了我好，政府掩蓋這些目擊事件，那麼政府還可能為了我好而做什麼其他事情？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

506. This is kind of Orwellian, 1984.
→ {"text": "這有點像歐威爾小說《1984》的極權監控。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "參考 terminology.yaml 中 Orwellian, 1984 條目"}

507. Mr. Dole, what was the reference for size, because the description of one of these is different than the description of others.
→ {"text": "多蘭先生 (Mr. Dolan)，尺寸的參考依據是什麼，因為其中一個的描述與其他描述不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "可能為 Dolan 的口誤，context 確認為 Richard Dolan"}

508. It was enormous in size.
→ {"text": "它的尺寸非常巨大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. What was their reference?
→ {"text": "他們的參考依據是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

510. Well, when I drive down the road and I have a little speck on my windshield, it doesn't look very big, but by golly, it can obscure my vision of a whole darn car down the road.
→ {"text": "嗯，當我在路上開車時，如果擋風玻璃上有一個小斑點，它看起來並不大，但天啊，它可以遮擋我對前方整輛車的視線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. So perception here, you know, there has to be some reference point before you really know how big something is.
→ {"text": "所以在感知上，你知道，在你真正知道某物有多大之前，必須有一些參考點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

512. I certainly agree, sir.
→ {"text": "我完全同意，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Dolan 回應"}

→ {"text": "尺寸的參考依據是出了名的不準確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

514. You get this frequently.
→ {"text": "這種情況經常發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. I assume you're referring to the first incident I mentioned, the Hanford case of 1945, where the pilots-- Well, he said it was as big as a couple aircraft carriers.
→ {"text": "我想您指的是我提到的第一起事件，1945 年的漢福德案例，飛行員——嗯，他說它有幾艘航空母艦那麼大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. Yeah, I don't know how he came to that conclusion, to be perfectly honest with you.
→ {"text": "是的，坦白說，我不知道他是如何得出那個結論的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

517. You do have in the research a few confirmed, and by confirmed I simply mean radar plus visual accounts of very enormous objects.
→ {"text": "在研究中確實有一些經過確認的案例，我所謂的確認只是指雷達加上目視報告的非常巨大的物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

518. It has happened.
→ {"text": "這種情況確實發生過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

520. In this particular case, I really don't know.
→ {"text": "在這個特定案例中，我真的不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

521. He simply, to his perception at that time, it looked very enormous.
→ {"text": "他只是，根據他當時的感知，它看起來非常巨大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

522. The sightings that were talked about are all fairly old.
→ {"text": "剛才談到的這些目擊事件都相當久遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

523. What's happened more recently?
→ {"text": "最近發生了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

524. Well, I don't want to jump if you had to say something, Robert.
→ {"text": "嗯，如果 Robert 有話要說，我不想搶先。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "可能指 Captain Salas"}

525. Recently, let's say 2010, there was a shutdown of 50 missiles at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base.
→ {"text": "最近，比如說 2010 年，F.E. Warren 空軍基地 (Francis E. Warren Air Force Base) 發生了 50 枚導彈關閉事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

526. This was announced by the Air Force.
→ {"text": "這是空軍宣布的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

527. It was eventually announced that it was a computer glitch.
→ {"text": "最終宣布這是一個電腦故障。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

528. Now, I'm very wary about that.
→ {"text": "現在，我對此非常謹慎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

529. I'm not sure I believe that, but we do have witnesses that have come forward, both civilian and Air Force, that said they saw an object in the sky at the time of these shutdowns.
→ {"text": "我不確定我是否相信，但我們確實有證人站出來，包括平民和空軍人員，他們說在這些導彈關閉時看到天空中有物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

530. This is still being investigated, but these incidents are still going on.
→ {"text": "這仍在調查中，但這些事件仍在繼續發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

531. They used to be reported by the press.
→ {"text": "過去媒體會報導這些事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

532. I don't see reports now in the public media.
→ {"text": "我現在沒有在公共媒體上看到報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

533. Do they just not report them because of the climate, the psychological climate that we're in?
→ {"text": "他們只是因為我們所處的氛圍、心理氛圍而不報導嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

534. Or are there no sightings recently?
→ {"text": "還是最近沒有目擊事件？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

535. I've seen no reports recently.
→ {"text": "我最近沒有看到報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

536. Well, I'd just like to mention a couple of things with regard to that.
→ {"text": "嗯，關於這一點，我想提一些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

537. It was mentioned previously in the Bentwaters panel.
→ {"text": "在之前的 Bentwaters 證人小組中曾提到過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

538. They talked about personnel reliability reporting, where they keep tabs on people involved with nuclear weapons and make sure they stay reliable.
→ {"text": "他們談到人員可靠性報告，也就是對涉及核武器的人員進行監控，確保他們保持可靠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

539. This is one way the Air Force is applying pressure not to report these things, but we certainly know from reports we're getting from time to time that these incidents are continuing.
→ {"text": "這是空軍施加壓力不讓報告這些事情的一種方式，但我們當然從不時收到的報告中知道這些事件仍在繼續。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

540. But that's one of the reasons I think Mr. Fenstermacher noted that some of their people were very reluctant to report what they saw, and I'm sure that had to do with the PRP program.
→ {"text": "但這就是我認為芬斯特馬赫先生 (Mr. Fenstermacher) 指出的原因之一，他們的一些人非常不願意報告他們所看到的，我確信這與 PRP（人員可靠性計畫）有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "PRP = Personnel Reliability Program"}

541. Two points. Since all of you have followed this activity, you know, we're not the only country that has Minutemen missiles in holes in the ground pointed at somebody.
→ {"text": "兩點。既然你們所有人都一直關注這項活動，你們知道，我們不是唯一一個在地下洞穴中擁有民兵導彈瞄準某人的國家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

542. It's the somebody that we're pointing at.
→ {"text": "就是我們瞄準的那個對象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指蘇聯"}

543. Did they have any, as a result of the implosion of the Soviet Union, the data that came forward and a lot of their files, do you have any knowledge as to whether or not the Russians or the Soviets had a similar experience with their missiles?
→ {"text": "由於蘇聯的解體，湧現出的數據和大量檔案，你們是否了解俄羅斯人或蘇聯人是否對他們的導彈有過類似的經歷？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

544. Anyone that wants to answer that? We'll start with Captain Scott.
→ {"text": "誰想回答這個問題？我們從斯科特上尉 (Captain Scott) 開始。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "委員會主席提問，但 Scott 是技術士官非上尉，可能口誤"}

545. I'll start with one that I think is in my book that I've given you a copy of.
→ {"text": "我先從一個我認為在我給過各位副本的書中的案例開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Captain Salas 回答"}

546. This was an incident, I think it was 1982. It was in the Soviet Union.
→ {"text": "這是一起事件，我想是 1982 年。發生在蘇聯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

547. And it was, you know, the witnesses come forward and are named.
→ {"text": "而且，你知道，證人站出來並且有名有姓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

548. And actually, I think there was an ABC special on this particular incident.
→ {"text": "事實上，我認為 ABC 電視台有一個關於這起特定事件的專題節目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

549. But as I recall, UFO came over and actually started their missile on the launch sequence.
→ {"text": "但據我回憶，不明飛行物飛過來，實際上啟動了他們導彈的發射序列。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

550. And thankfully, it was shut down from that launch sequence.
→ {"text": "幸運的是，它從該發射序列中被關閉了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

551. But there have been, there definitely have been sightings over Soviet bases.
→ {"text": "但確實有過，肯定有過蘇聯基地上空的目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

552. There's a large, large quantity there also of incidents where UFOs were seen over missile bases.
→ {"text": "在那裡也有大量的事件，UFO 被看到在導彈基地上空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

553. Did they have the same effect that is stopping the ability of the missile to work through whatever device?
→ {"text": "他們是否有相同的效果，也就是透過某種裝置阻止導彈工作的能力？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "委員追問"}

554. I'm not familiar with any specific case like that.
→ {"text": "我不熟悉任何那樣的具體案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

555. Okay. And Captain Fenstermacher, did you nod at your head like you had some knowledge in that?
→ {"text": "好的。芬斯特馬赫上尉 (Captain Fenstermacher)，您點頭了，是不是對此有所了解？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

556. I saw the same report that Bob Salas had. I saw it on ABC.
→ {"text": "我看到了 Bob Salas 看到的同一份報告。我在 ABC 上看到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Salwas 拼寫錯誤"}

557. And I've read other reports, but nothing quantifiable, you know.
→ {"text": "我讀過其他報告，但都沒有可量化的內容，你知道的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

558. Plus, if I read reports about some of the people coming forward like we have, I wouldn't necessarily believe them, you know.
→ {"text": "而且，如果我讀到關於一些像我們這樣站出來的人的報告，我不一定會相信他們，你知道的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

559. But I've read reports about it.
→ {"text": "但我讀過相關報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

560. And instead of knocking them offline, actually it started the launch process, which really to me is more worrisome.
→ {"text": "不是使它們離線，而是實際上啟動了發射過程，這對我來說真的更令人擔憂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

561. Yeah, because they suspected us.
→ {"text": "是的，因為他們懷疑是我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "委員回應"}

562. But so either the launch sequence was interrupted or they backed down.
→ {"text": "但所以要麼發射序列被中斷，要麼他們退縮了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

563. It was initiated.
→ {"text": "它被啟動了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

564. It was initiated.
→ {"text": "它被啟動了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "重複確認"}

565. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

566. But apparently, it's the control mechanisms that you could still start to launch sequence, but the control mechanisms were the ones that were interrupted by whatever forces were in effect.
→ {"text": "但顯然，是控制機制，你仍然可以啟動發射序列，但控制機制是被當時生效的任何力量中斷的部分。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句子結構較複雜"}

567. So I was just curious that, you know, if there was a focus of attention on U.S. ICBMs, obviously extraterrestrial would have an interest in the Soviet ICBMs and also would have interest in ICBMs in the world today, not by other countries.
→ {"text": "所以我只是好奇，你知道，如果關注焦點在美國洲際彈道導彈上，顯然外星的存在會對蘇聯洲際彈道導彈感興趣，也會對當今世界其他國家的洲際彈道導彈感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "extraterrestrial 用作形容詞"}

568. At the very end of the Soviet -- Richard, I was going to just come to you.
→ {"text": "在蘇聯末期——Richard，我正要問你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "委員轉向 Richard Dolan"}

569. Oh, I'm so sorry.
→ {"text": "哦，非常抱歉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. Maybe your research -- now you've found something. This was anecdotal. Now what did you find?
→ {"text": "也許你的研究——你找到了些東西。這是軼事性質的。現在你發現了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

571. Well, in the last couple of years of the Soviet Union's existence, there was a remarkable amount of openness in the press from the Soviet military on this matter, quite a bit.
→ {"text": "嗯，在蘇聯存在的最後幾年，蘇聯軍方在這個問題上向媒體表現出驚人的開放程度，相當多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

572. It was like a window of opportunity, as people used to say at the time.
→ {"text": "這就像一個機會之窗，正如當時人們常說的那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

573. And there were a number of cases, one at Kasputin Yar in 1989.
→ {"text": "有許多案例，其中一個是 1989 年在 Kasputin Yar 的案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

574. I don't think that involved nuclear, but that was a rocket launch facility.
→ {"text": "我不認為那涉及核武，但那是一個火箭發射設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

575. There was an unknown object that appeared. It involved a jet scramble.

576. It was quite extraordinary, very dramatic.
→ {"text": "那是相當不尋常的，非常戲劇性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

577. There was a case just outside Moscow in March of 1990, which involved an unbelievable encounter by an object that was playing all sorts of games with the Soviet jet interceptor, seen by multiple witnesses.
→ {"text": "1990 年 3 月在莫斯科郊外有一起案例，涉及一個令人難以置信的遭遇，一個物體與蘇聯噴射攔截機玩各種花樣，被多名證人目擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

578. The Soviet minister of defense spoke about it.
→ {"text": "蘇聯國防部長談到了這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. The Soviet top general for air defense spoke about it.
→ {"text": "蘇聯防空最高將領談到了這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. They both discounted that this was American. They said, "It's not a chance."
→ {"text": "他們都排除了這是美國的可能性。他們說：「不可能。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

581. In fact, the top Soviet commander said, "There is no way we're ever going to try to attack this.
→ {"text": "事實上，蘇聯最高指揮官說：「我們永遠不會試圖攻擊這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

582. It was vastly beyond anything that we or anyone we know had."
→ {"text": "它遠遠超出我們或我們所知的任何人所擁有的任何東西。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. So there were quite a few very dramatic cases, and there were some that involved nuclear facilities, but we don't have as much information.
→ {"text": "所以有相當多非常戲劇性的案例，其中有一些涉及核設施，但我們沒有那麼多資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我有一些一般性的問題，也許我們從薩拉斯上尉 (Captain Salas) 開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. These were all classified, and you took the oath that you wouldn't tell.

600. And so they did. They declassified the echo shutdown incident, and they started sending me documents.
→ {"text": "他們就這樣做了。他們解密了 Echo 關閉事件，並開始向我發送文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

601. So I started speaking about it at that point because I thought at that point that that's where I was because you have to understand all these facilities look pretty much the same.
→ {"text": "所以我當時開始談論它，因為我當時認為那就是我所在的地方，因為你必須了解所有這些設施看起來都差不多一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

602. I knew I wasn't in the same squadron as Echo, but I did know that at times we did help out when they were short on crews.
→ {"text": "我知道我不在與 Echo 同一個中隊，但我確實知道有時當他們人手不足時我們會幫忙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "直到 1996 年，當我聯繫我的指揮官 Fred Mywald 時，我才意識到我在 Oscar 飛行中隊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Mywall 可能為 Mywald 的轉錄錯誤"}

604. And then I realized I'd been speaking out of turn, so to speak, because I had violated my oath by not speaking about my specific incident.
→ {"text": "然後我意識到我說錯了話，可以這麼說，因為我沒有談論我的特定事件而違反了我的誓言。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "意思是他誤以為在談論已解密的 Echo 事件，實際上是在談論仍機密的 Oscar 事件"}

605. I made a decision to continue speaking about it, and I've been speaking about it ever since.

606. I've never been harried by the Air Force.

609. Well, we're glad you do.
→ {"text": "嗯，我們很高興你這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

610. For any one of you, I think so often when we hear the initial UFO, we always think of it as somewhere outer space, don't know, this is a huge universe, where they come from.
→ {"text": "對你們任何一個人來說，我認為當我們聽到 UFO 這個詞時，我們總是認為它來自外太空某處，不知道，這是一個巨大的宇宙，它們從哪裡來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "女士，這些問題不僅私人研究人員一直在問，機密研究人員也一直在問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Dolan 回答"}

→ {"text": "當你回顧我們所知的歷史，回到 1940 年代末，當這個現象首次在空軍中出現時，對這個問題有各種競爭性的解決方案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

685. I alluded to it in my statement.

689. And never followed up on it. The Condon investigators never followed up on it. Robert Lowe never followed up on it. It was never mentioned. And that's because it was classified.
→ {"text": "但從未跟進。康登調查員從未跟進。Robert Low 從未跟進。它從未被提及。那是因為它是機密的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Robert Lowe 可能為 Low 的拼寫錯誤"}

→ {"text": "藍皮書計畫於 1952 年成立，是由於當時發生的 UFO 目擊事件大幅增加。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

695. That this problem is too big and we need to knock UFOs out of the public mind. And Blue Book was then gutted and stripped of really all capabilities. And for the rest of its existence, it had no more than a staff of about four or five people with no capability and on strict orders.
→ {"text": "這個問題太大了，我們需要把 UFO 從公眾的腦海中剔除。然後藍皮書計畫被掏空並被剝奪了真正所有的能力。在它存在的其餘時間裡，它只有大約四五個人的工作人員，沒有能力並且受到嚴格命令。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

696. This is an explicit Air Force order of 1954-55 saying you are required to get your number of unknowns down to a bare minimum. And they did that by hook or crook. Didn't matter. So it became very much a kind of an open joke, to be quite frank.
→ {"text": "這是 1954-55 年空軍的明確命令，說你必須將未知案例的數量減少到最低限度。他們不擇手段地做到了這一點。無所謂。所以坦白說，它在很大程度上成為一種公開的笑話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

699. Is your opinion then, Mr. Dolan, that the Air Force is more reluctant even today than they were during that period of '52 to '67 to even talk about or discuss or take information from captains and sergeants and colonels and even generals, any kind of pilots and so on, than they were then?
→ {"text": "那麼，多蘭先生 (Mr. Dolan)，你的意見是，空軍今天甚至比他們在 1952 到 1967 年期間更不願意談論或討論或從上尉、士官、上校甚至將軍、任何類型的飛行員等那裡獲取資訊嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

700. Absolutely, I believe that. This is a complete nightmare for them to deal with.
→ {"text": "絕對的，我相信。這對他們來說是一場完全的噩夢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

701. Our final presenter before our break, our ten minute break or so, will be Congresswoman Wolsey. Well, I was sitting here, thank you, all five of you, and Steve who was there before you, getting really uncomfortable about the position this has put you in all these years.

→ {"text": "但我想回顧一下為什麼是這個小組，為什麼我們都是退休的國會議員？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

704. Well, you know what? We don't have a lot to lose. But it would be, this would be one of the issues that a sitting member would risk losing an election over. 60 second, I mean, ad. And clearance, yeah, to find out data that you have to have clearance for.

705. And but then that was the third piece of this is to me and I feel maybe I'm being too optimistic. I think this week is going to change the feeling and respect that the common constituent, the regular member of our country, the population, the populace.
→ {"text": "但那是這個的第三部分，對我來說，我覺得也許我太樂觀了。我認為這一周將改變普通選民、我國的普通成員、人口、民眾的感受和尊重。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句子結構較鬆散"}

→ {"text": "人們不再對我耳語，他們知道我經常被取笑，因為我是已經離開眾議院的最左翼進步派成員之一，但那是在眾議院的時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

708. And so my constituents, they're really supportive of me. Lucky me. But they would come in and they would whisper, you know, Congresswoman, I think there's something to this.
→ {"text": "所以我的選民，他們真的很支持我。我很幸運。但他們會進來，他們會低聲說，你知道，女議員，我認為這件事有些道理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

709. And I would say, well, if it is or isn't, I'm going to go and find out why we can't find out. And they can count on, you know, that I would do that. But I'm not sure I would have done it if I was a sitting member. I have to be honest with you.
→ {"text": "我會說，嗯，不管是不是，我會去找出為什麼我們無法找出答案。他們可以指望，你知道，我會這樣做。但我不確定如果我是現任議員我會這樣做。我必須對你們誠實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

710. Ms. Woolsey, may I make a comment? For the last year, we have been sending documents, myself and Mr. Victor Viggiani of ZlandCommunications have been sending documents to Representative Peter King of New York.
