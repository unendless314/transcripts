## Speaker Group 1

504. We're now going to open it to our members, and we're going to start with Congressman Bartlett.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. As I've sat and listened to this testimony, I was asking myself a question. If for my good, there is a cover-up of these sightings, then what else might the government do for my good?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. This is kind of Orwellian, 1984.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. Mr. Dole, what was the reference for size, because the description of one of these is different than the description of others.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

508. It was enormous in size.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

509. What was their reference?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. Well, when I drive down the road and I have a little speck on my windshield, it doesn't look very big, but by golly, it can obscure my vision of a whole darn car down the road.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. So perception here, you know, there has to be some reference point before you really know how big something is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. I certainly agree, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. References for size are notoriously inaccurate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. You get this frequently.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. I assume you're referring to the first incident I mentioned, the Hanford case of 1945, where the pilots-- Well, he said it was as big as a couple aircraft carriers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. Yeah, I don't know how he came to that conclusion, to be perfectly honest with you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. You do have in the research a few confirmed, and by confirmed I simply mean radar plus visual accounts of very enormous objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

518. It has happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. It seems incomprehensible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

520. In this particular case, I really don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. He simply, to his perception at that time, it looked very enormous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. The sightings that were talked about are all fairly old.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. What's happened more recently?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. Well, I don't want to jump if you had to say something, Robert.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. Recently, let's say 2010, there was a shutdown of 50 missiles at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. This was announced by the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

527. It was eventually announced that it was a computer glitch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

528. Now, I'm very wary about that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. I'm not sure I believe that, but we do have witnesses that have come forward, both civilian and Air Force, that said they saw an object in the sky at the time of these shutdowns.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

530. This is still being investigated, but these incidents are still going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. They used to be reported by the press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. I don't see reports now in the public media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. Do they just not report them because of the climate, the psychological climate that we're in?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. Or are there no sightings recently?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. I've seen no reports recently.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. Well, I'd just like to mention a couple of things with regard to that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. It was mentioned previously in the Bentwaters panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. They talked about personnel reliability reporting, where they keep tabs on people involved with nuclear weapons and make sure they stay reliable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

539. This is one way the Air Force is applying pressure not to report these things, but we certainly know from reports we're getting from time to time that these incidents are continuing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. But that's one of the reasons I think Mr. Fenstermacher noted that some of their people were very reluctant to report what they saw, and I'm sure that had to do with the PRP program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. Two points. Since all of you have followed this activity, you know, we're not the only country that has Minutemen missiles in holes in the ground pointed at somebody.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

542. It's the somebody that we're pointing at.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. Did they have any, as a result of the implosion of the Soviet Union, the data that came forward and a lot of their files, do you have any knowledge as to whether or not the Russians or the Soviets had a similar experience with their missiles?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. Anyone that wants to answer that? We'll start with Captain Scott.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

545. I'll start with one that I think is in my book that I've given you a copy of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

546. This was an incident, I think it was 1982. It was in the Soviet Union.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. And it was, you know, the witnesses come forward and are named.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. And actually, I think there was an ABC special on this particular incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. But as I recall, UFO came over and actually started their missile on the launch sequence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. And thankfully, it was shut down from that launch sequence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. But there have been, there definitely have been sightings over Soviet bases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

552. There's a large, large quantity there also of incidents where UFOs were seen over missile bases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. Did they have the same effect that is stopping the ability of the missile to work through whatever device?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

554. I'm not familiar with any specific case like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

555. Okay. And Captain Fenstermacher, did you nod at your head like you had some knowledge in that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

556. I saw the same report that Bob Salas had. I saw it on ABC.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

557. And I've read other reports, but nothing quantifiable, you know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

558. Plus, if I read reports about some of the people coming forward like we have, I wouldn't necessarily believe them, you know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

559. But I've read reports about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. And instead of knocking them offline, actually it started the launch process, which really to me is more worrisome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

561. Yeah, because they suspected us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

562. But so either the launch sequence was interrupted or they backed down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

563. It was initiated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

564. It was initiated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

565. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

566. But apparently, it's the control mechanisms that you could still start to launch sequence, but the control mechanisms were the ones that were interrupted by whatever forces were in effect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

567. So I was just curious that, you know, if there was a focus of attention on U.S. ICBMs, obviously extraterrestrial would have an interest in the Soviet ICBMs and also would have interest in ICBMs in the world today, not by other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. At the very end of the Soviet -- Richard, I was going to just come to you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. Oh, I'm so sorry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

570. Maybe your research -- now you've found something. This was anecdotal. Now what did you find?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

571. Well, in the last couple of years of the Soviet Union's existence, there was a remarkable amount of openness in the press from the Soviet military on this matter, quite a bit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

572. It was like a window of opportunity, as people used to say at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

573. And there were a number of cases, one at Kasputin Yar in 1989.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

574. I don't think that involved nuclear, but that was a rocket launch facility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

575. There was an unknown object that appeared. It involved a jet scramble.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

576. It was quite extraordinary, very dramatic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

577. There was a case just outside Moscow in March of 1990, which involved an unbelievable encounter by an object that was playing all sorts of games with the Soviet jet interceptor, seen by multiple witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

578. The Soviet minister of defense spoke about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

579. The Soviet top general for air defense spoke about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

580. They both discounted that this was American. They said, "It's not a chance."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. In fact, the top Soviet commander said, "There is no way we're ever going to try to attack this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

582. It was vastly beyond anything that we or anyone we know had."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

583. So there were quite a few very dramatic cases, and there were some that involved nuclear facilities, but we don't have as much information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

584. Thank you. My time's up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

585. Thank you. Congresswoman Hooley.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

586. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

587. I have some questions just in general, and maybe we'll start with Captain Salas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

588. These were all classified, and you took the oath that you wouldn't tell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

589. Keep them as a secret. Why are you talking now?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. Thank you for asking that question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

591. I did not speak about this for almost 30 years. I kept my oath.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

592. In 1994, I happened to pick up a book called "Above Top Secret" by Timothy Goode.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

593. On page 301 of that book, it stated in a very short paragraph that missiles were shut down in Malsom Air Force Base during UFO sighting in 1967.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

594. I immediately thought that that was my incident because it described it fairly well, and I decided to go ahead and request, under the Freedom of Information Act, information about that specific incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. They were talking about the echo flight shutdown because I thought that was my incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

596. So I didn't mention anything about UFOs when we sent the inquiry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

597. I just asked for, well, actually my researcher, James Klotz, who was with MUFON at the time, requested this information under FOIA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

598. The Air Force wrote back and said, you know, this incident is classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

599. However, because of the time lapse, we're going to declassify it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

600. And so they did. They declassified the echo shutdown incident, and they started sending me documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

601. So I started speaking about it at that point because I thought at that point that that's where I was because you have to understand all these facilities look pretty much the same.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

602. I knew I wasn't in the same squadron as Echo, but I did know that at times we did help out when they were short on crews.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

603. It wasn't until 1996 when I contacted my commander, Fred Mywall, that I realized I was at Oscar flight.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

604. And then I realized I'd been speaking out of turn, so to speak, because I had violated my oath by not speaking about my specific incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

605. I made a decision to continue speaking about it, and I've been speaking about it ever since.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

606. I've never been harried by the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

607. Nobody's ever knocked on my door and said, can't talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

608. So I continue to speak about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

609. Well, we're glad you do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

610. For any one of you, I think so often when we hear the initial UFO, we always think of it as somewhere outer space, don't know, this is a huge universe, where they come from.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

611. Do you think they're from somewhere in outer space, or do you think these are made by some country that we, in our little universe, that we know about?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

612. Tell me what you think.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

613. Madam, these are questions that not only private researchers have been asking, but also classified researchers have been asking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

614. When you go back through the history that we know of, back in the late 1940s, when this first appeared on the scene within the Air Force, there were competing solutions to this problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

615. Right off the bat, you had analysts who were convinced that there was no possible way that this could have been Soviet manufacture or American, that the performance capabilities were too advanced.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

616. There were other people who did suspect the Soviet Union.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

617. In fact, during the incident over Los Alamos that I mentioned earlier, there was speculation, wondering, could this have been a Soviet type of technology?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

618. There's just no evidence for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

619. We all realize that within the black budget world, there are vastly advanced types of technologies in various ways.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

620. In many cases, NSA computing, for example, is at least three decades ahead of the rest of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

621. At least they were in the 1960s, and they probably still are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

622. There are other black budget groups that have, who knows what they have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

623. That's always a thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

624. If you were to see a perfectly hovering triangle, and there are triangular UFOs hovering above you today, you'd have to ask yourself, is this ours or theirs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

625. This is one of the fundamental questions that serious research asks these days, because it's very difficult.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

626. I will just offer my own opinion that a large portion of these objects are not ours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

627. I think that's what you find when you speak with individuals within the classified world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

628. I've been privileged to do that many, many times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

629. Some extremely prominent individuals, if I may say, and that is their opinion as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

630. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

631. Thank you, Congresswoman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

632. Congressman Cook, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

633. Congressman Fenstermacher, unlike some of the other testimony here today, you said that you didn't wait too long before you started talking about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

634. Am I correct in understanding that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

635. I just came forward after I saw Bob Salas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

636. Oh, excuse me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

637. I misunderstood that then.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

638. I just want to say I would commend all of you for coming out with your statements.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

639. And I certainly understand the reasons why for many, many years you may be reluctant.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

640. But had you -- I thought I had heard something that I misheard, obviously.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

641. But the reason I'm asking this is because I want to ask you all each about the Air Force Project Blue Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

642. Blue Book was being done -- you know, there's a lot of money spent on Project Blue Book by the Air Force during, what, the '47 to '69 period.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

643. And some of your events occurred that you've talked about, certainly that you saw as your event, occurred while Blue Book was still being funded and written about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

644. And Blue Book is, as I understand it, totally published now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

645. It's out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

646. And let me make sure I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

647. I think the ear of your -- what you saw witnessed -- Seventy-six.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

648. Seventy-six.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

649. And again -- Seventy-four.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

650. Seventy-four.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

651. Seventy-six.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

652. Seventy-six.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

653. So both the two captains right directly in front of me here, the things that you saw, is there any indication in Project Blue Book about those?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

654. Or were you ever contacted in regards -- I take it you were never contacted in regards to Project Blue Book at the time?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

655. Or am I wrong on that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

656. Or by anybody in the Air Force that was telling you that that's what they were doing?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

657. They were gathering -- I realize they may take your statements and not tell you why they're taking them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

658. So the only thing they did with me is shove a piece of paper in my face and told me to sign it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

659. I never heard another word about it afterwards.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

660. In researching -- I've been researching this subject for 18, 19 years now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

661. And recently I discovered that Project Blue Book had secret files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

662. They had two sets of files, one available to the public and a set of secret files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

663. And so again, I've got evidence of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

664. So no, when the Conant investigator came to Malmstrom Air Force Base to talk to our deputy base commander, Colonel Chase, Colonel Chase said this was a classified incident, you could not review the report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

665. So they put it in a classified Blue Book file at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

666. And do you have any feeling on the same question, Captain Scindelli?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

667. At the time I knew nothing about Blue Book per se.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

668. I do recall an incident or instance during my time at Minot where there was some discussion among some crew members about Blue Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

669. But I never knew what that was at the time until 40 years later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

670. And then I find out about Blue Book and then I find out about this article in the Saturday Evening Post.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

671. And I find out about Val Smith, who's in my squadron.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

672. And then I find out about released documents from the Air Force that mention his name.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

673. And now I understand that's where the talk about Blue Book came from.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

674. It's very likely that not too many people in the Air Force, even captains and colonels and everything else, even generals, knew that much about Blue Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

675. Am I right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

676. I imagine that you've reviewed some of what's in Blue Book since.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

677. I mean, recently, for example, is there anything in Blue Book that's been published now that would indicate anything close to what you saw in Montana or in North Dakota, Minot, or in Wyoming or in the other?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

678. Have you looked at that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

679. In other words?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

680. No, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

681. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

682. And do any of you have any feeling as to why Blue Book, why they stopped Blue Book?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

683. Or do you have any, can you give us your opinion, totally opinion, of why Blue Book was discontinued?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

684. Yes, Mr. Cook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

685. I alluded to it in my statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

686. The Condon investigation, which was supposed to look into the UFO question for the Air Force, was a whitewash.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

687. It was intended to allow the Air Force to wash its hands of the UFO question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

688. And I have evidence of that. The evidence that I have is the fact that Dr. Craig, who was the chief investigator for Condon, was given information about the Echo and Oscar flight shutdowns. He was given names and dates, et cetera.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

689. And never followed up on it. The Condon investigators never followed up on it. Robert Lowe never followed up on it. It was never mentioned. And that's because it was classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

690. I would like to just answer your question very quickly. I can give you the quick lowdown on Blue Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

691. Blue Book was formed in 1952 as a result of a tremendous upsurge in UFO sightings that were happening at that time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

692. That was the only time in Blue Book's history that they actually had a staff that was capable of doing investigations. They had about 12 people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

693. Their percentage of unknowns for that year was quite high. It was almost 25 percent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

694. The order came down after the CIA sponsored Robertson Panel, which was at the very end of the Truman administration, to say, that's too high.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

695. That this problem is too big and we need to knock UFOs out of the public mind. And Blue Book was then gutted and stripped of really all capabilities. And for the rest of its existence, it had no more than a staff of about four or five people with no capability and on strict orders.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

696. This is an explicit Air Force order of 1954-55 saying you are required to get your number of unknowns down to a bare minimum. And they did that by hook or crook. Didn't matter. So it became very much a kind of an open joke, to be quite frank.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

697. The Blue Book explanations were generally not considered very valid because they were not sufficiently investigated in any scientific way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

698. Chair, one quick follow-up question that will take ten seconds to answer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

699. Is your opinion then, Mr. Dolan, that the Air Force is more reluctant even today than they were during that period of '52 to '67 to even talk about or discuss or take information from captains and sergeants and colonels and even generals, any kind of pilots and so on, than they were then?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

700. Absolutely, I believe that. This is a complete nightmare for them to deal with.

701. Our final presenter before our break, our ten minute break or so, will be Congresswoman Wolsey. Well, I was sitting here, thank you, all five of you, and Steve who was there before you, getting really uncomfortable about the position this has put you in all these years.

702. And honoring you in my heart for getting past that and getting here today and knowing that was not an easy thing to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

703. But I wanted to then reflect back on why is this panel, why are we all retired members of Congress?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

704. Well, you know what? We don't have a lot to lose. But it would be, this would be one of the issues that a sitting member would risk losing an election over. 60 second, I mean, ad. And clearance, yeah, to find out data that you have to have clearance for.

705. And but then that was the third piece of this is to me and I feel maybe I'm being too optimistic. I think this week is going to change the feeling and respect that the common constituent, the regular member of our country, the population, the populace.

706. I think if they pay any attention to this, they are going to have a different respect for it. And they'll be able to say it.

707. Instead of whispering to me, people who knew that I get teased a lot because I'm the one of the most left progressive members that have left the house, but that was in the house.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

708. And so my constituents, they're really supportive of me. Lucky me. But they would come in and they would whisper, you know, Congresswoman, I think there's something to this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

709. And I would say, well, if it is or isn't, I'm going to go and find out why we can't find out. And they can count on, you know, that I would do that. But I'm not sure I would have done it if I was a sitting member. I have to be honest with you.

710. Ms. Woolsey, may I make a comment? For the last year, we have been sending documents, myself and Mr. Victor Viggiani of ZlandCommunications have been sending documents to Representative Peter King of New York.

711. He's got all the documents. He's got my book. He knows my story, but he has not acted on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

712. I've also briefed Congressman Rohrabacher, a congressman from California. I think he's still in Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

713. Yes, he is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

714. I briefed him, I think it was the year 2000, and he still hasn't acted on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

715. Well, there's 433 other members that haven't acted also.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

716. So I hope that this week could make it more comfortable for them and maybe help put the pressure on our government to be more open and to stop covering up and having secret files. So I thank you very much for being here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

717. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

718. We're going to take a short 8, 10 minute stretch or break for a moment and when we come back we'll conclude for the afternoon.
