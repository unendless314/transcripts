→ {"text": "我不是美國軍方的前成員，但我一生都致力於研究不明飛行物與國家安全的議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. What we know from research and archival work is that from the beginning of the atomic age, there have been good reports, very good reports, of unknown objects with extraordinary capabilities being in the vicinity of our most advanced nuclear facilities.
→ {"text": "根據研究與檔案工作，我們得知從原子時代開始，就有良好的報告，非常良好的報告，記載具有非凡能力的不明物體出現在我們最先進的核設施附近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. They certainly appear to be interested, if not always tampering, definitely interested.

393. I'm going to describe a few of these cases to you, but first I want to describe an event that is not in a declassified document.
→ {"text": "我將向各位描述其中幾個案例，但首先我想描述一個並非來自解密文件的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. It's a written account from a credible witness that really is quite fascinating.

→ {"text": "UFO 互動網絡，簡稱 MUFON，多年來一直是美國最大的民間 UFO 組織。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. So here's what happened. In July 1945, near the close of the Pacific War, the Hanford Atomic Facility, located in the state of Washington, one of the key elements of America's new nuclear infrastructure was there.
→ {"text": "事情是這樣的。1945 年 7 月，接近太平洋戰爭尾聲時，位於華盛頓州的漢福德原子設施 (Hanford Atomic Facility)，美國新核武基礎設施的關鍵要素之一就在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. Now, although at this time no one was expecting a Japanese threat to it as the end of the war was near, but there were still standby aircraft armed and ready at all times just in case anything were to happen.
→ {"text": "當時，儘管由於戰爭即將結束，沒有人預期會有日本的威脅，但仍然有待命飛機隨時武裝就緒，以防萬一發生任何狀況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "雷達偵測到一個快速移動的物體，現在正以盤旋模式懸停在漢福德工廠的正上方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. It was very high. No one was able to see it at first, only on radar.
→ {"text": "它的高度非常高。起初沒有人能用肉眼看見它，只能在雷達上看到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. Six pilots flying Grumman F6F Hellcats were sent up. Finally, they saw it, and they flew to intercept it.

407. It was estimated to be about 65,000 feet, very, very high up.
→ {"text": "估計它的高度約為 65,000 英呎，非常非常高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. No one was able to recognize it. It had what the book described as "a saucer-like appearance, bright, very fast, very high."
→ {"text": "沒有人能辨認出它是什麼。根據書中描述，它具有「類似碟形的外觀，明亮、速度非常快、高度非常高」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. The pilot, Roland Powell, later described this object to be as large as "three aircraft carriers, side-by-side, oval-shaped, very streamlined, like a stretched-out egg, and pinkish in color."
→ {"text": "飛行員 Roland Powell 後來描述這個物體的大小如同「三艘航空母艦並排放置，橢圓形，非常流線型，像一顆拉長的蛋，顏色呈粉紅色」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. He said it gave out a kind of vapor around the outside edges, he believed, from portholes or vents, and he speculated that the vapor was being discharged to form a cloud as a disguise.
→ {"text": "他說它在外緣周圍散發出一種蒸氣，他相信是從舷窗或通風口排出，他推測這些蒸氣被排放出來形成雲層作為偽裝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. Anyway, the pilots were baffled. They were told to go higher.
→ {"text": "無論如何，飛行員們都感到困惑。他們被告知要飛得更高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. They replied, "If we go much higher, we're going to ruin these engines."
→ {"text": "他們回答：「如果我們再飛高一點，就會毀掉這些引擎。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. And the answer came back, "Blow the engines if you have to, but use full power, full military power, full throttle injection, maximum continuous, go for it."
→ {"text": "得到的回應是：「如果必要的話就炸掉引擎，但要使用全功率，全軍用功率，全油門注入，最大持續功率，全力以赴。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. They were then told that if the engines quit, they were to glide back toward the airport and hope that you make it.
→ {"text": "然後他們被告知，如果引擎熄火，就滑翔回機場，希望能成功降落。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. Even so, no one was able to get close enough to the object.
→ {"text": "即使如此，沒有人能夠接近那個物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. It didn't seem to do anything. It just hovered there, as if observing, staying well enough out of reach.
→ {"text": "它似乎什麼也沒做。它只是懸停在那裡，彷彿在觀察，保持著足夠的距離無法接近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. The pilots were quite amazed at its ability to hover.

421. They had pushed their aircraft up to 42,000 feet, which was 5,000 feet above their maximum ceiling.
→ {"text": "他們將飛機推升到 42,000 英呎，比最大升限高出 5,000 英呎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. It was very obviously a serious event. No press coverage, as you would expect.
→ {"text": "這顯然是一個嚴重的事件。如你所料，沒有任何新聞報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. Now, you might argue, you might quibble that this is just a story unconfirmed by government or military documents, but it was a detailed story from an experienced World War II pilot, and you can take it for what you will.
→ {"text": "現在，你可能會爭辯，你可能會質疑這只是一個未經政府或軍方文件證實的故事，但這是一位經驗豐富的二戰飛行員的詳細敘述，你可以自行判斷其價值。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. We do, however, have a number of declassified government documents that describe UFOs being seen over America's nuclear facilities in the early atomic era.
→ {"text": "然而，我們確實擁有許多解密的政府文件，描述在早期原子時代於美國核設施上空目擊 UFO 的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. Several from the FBI describe a series of events over and near Los Alamos.
→ {"text": "其中幾份來自 FBI 的文件描述了在洛斯阿拉莫斯 (Los Alamos) 上空及附近發生的一系列事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. This is, again, another central component of America's nuclear program.
→ {"text": "這同樣是美國核武計畫的另一個核心組成部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. One of these FBI documents from January 31, 1949, and then there was another from a year and a half later, in August of 1950, describe what you can only call an invasion of sensitive airspace repeatedly by unknown and extraordinary objects.
→ {"text": "其中一份 FBI 文件日期為 1949 年 1 月 31 日，另一份則是一年半後的 1950 年 8 月，描述了只能稱之為不明且非凡物體反覆入侵敏感空域的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. So the first document gives specific dates for the initial sightings when they began in December 1948.
→ {"text": "第一份文件記載了最初目擊事件的具體日期，始於 1948 年 12 月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. In that month, they occurred on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 20th, and 28th of that month.

430. The witnesses were all very high caliber. We're talking special agents of OSI, airline pilots, military pilots, Los Alamos security inspectors.
→ {"text": "證人的可信度都非常高。我們談的是特別調查處 (OSI) 的特別探員、航空公司飛行員、軍方飛行員、洛斯阿拉莫斯安全檢查員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. There was some speculation that these objects might have been Soviet, but there were no reasons offered, no evidence offered.
→ {"text": "有人推測這些物體可能是蘇聯的，但沒有提供任何理由，也沒有提供任何證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. In fact, there's no evidence to this day. Meteorites were also ruled out in this analysis.
→ {"text": "事實上，直到今天也沒有證據。隕石也在這次分析中被排除了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Whisper 錯誤（原為 Media rights）"}

433. The initial conclusion was that they were either dealing with a previous unknown natural phenomenon or something manmade, except no one seemed to know any project anywhere that could have caused these sightings.
→ {"text": "最初的結論是，他們要麼面對的是先前未知的自然現象，要麼是人造物體，但似乎沒有人知道任何地方有任何計畫可能導致這些目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. And again, after more than 60 years, we still don't.
→ {"text": "而且，60 多年後的今天，我們仍然不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. By the way, the second of those documents referring to Los Alamos incursions, this is by August of 1950, stated that by then a total of 150 observations had been made.
→ {"text": "順帶一提，第二份關於洛斯阿拉莫斯入侵事件的文件，日期為 1950 年 8 月，指出到那時已經有總計 150 次觀察記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. You think about it, 150 over that region in about a year and a half.
→ {"text": "想想看，在大約一年半的時間內，該地區有 150 次目擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. By then, they'd been able to determine that there were three types of objects being seen.
→ {"text": "到那時，他們已經能夠確定被目擊的物體有三種類型。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. First was a type known as green fireballs, which were objects, this is in the words of the memo, moving at high speeds in shapes resembling half moons, circles, and disks emitting green light.
→ {"text": "第一種是被稱為綠色火球的類型，根據備忘錄的描述，這些物體以高速移動，形狀類似半月形、圓形和圓盤，發出綠光。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. The second type was a bit more of the in your face variety, that is, disks, round flat shaped objects or phenomena moving at fast velocity and emitting a brilliant white light or reflected light, that's the memo.
→ {"text": "第二種類型更加明目張膽，也就是圓盤、圓形扁平狀的物體或現象，以快速移動並發出明亮的白光或反射光，這是備忘錄的說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. And then the third type were meteors, which you might breathe a sigh of relief, except that the author then immediately says, well, aerial phenomena resembling meteoric material, moving at high velocity and varying in color.
→ {"text": "第三種類型是流星，你可能會鬆一口氣，但作者隨即又說，嗯，類似流星物質的空中現象，以高速移動且顏色多變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. The colors noted were white, amber, red, and green, so quite a range.

→ {"text": "一份 1950 年 10 月 13 日的解密電傳打字稿指出，前一晚空軍雷達裝置偵測到 11 個不明物體，可能更多，穿越橡樹嶺上空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. They were slow, low in the sky, less than 5,000 feet, maybe 1,000.
→ {"text": "它們速度緩慢，在低空飛行，低於 5,000 英呎，也許只有 1,000 英呎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. Some wondered if this was maybe a weather phenomenon.
→ {"text": "有些人懷疑這可能是天氣現象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. It doesn't appear to be because the sightings continued, and we get another teletype from just a few days later, December 8, from the FBI's Richmond office.
→ {"text": "但似乎不是，因為目擊事件持續發生，我們又看到了幾天後，也就是 12 月 8 日，來自 FBI 里奇蒙辦公室的另一份電傳打字稿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "甚至有證據顯示這類事件在最近仍持續發生，儘管由於相關機構的不回應和阻撓而較難確認。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

495. Yet the events which took place so long ago not only demand a scientific analysis, but they also cry out to be understood for what they were, a key component in the implementation of secrecy so profound, so serious, that they contributed to the creation of a state within a state, not bound by the traditional American goals of public openness and responsiveness to the people.
→ {"text": "然而，很久以前發生的這些事件不僅需要科學分析，它們也迫切需要被理解其本質，它們是實施如此深刻、如此嚴重的保密制度的關鍵組成部分，以至於它們促成了國中之國的形成，不受傳統美國公開透明和對人民負責的目標約束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

496. One might argue such events are so serious that the public really doesn't have a need to know.
→ {"text": "有人可能會爭辯說，這些事件如此嚴重，以至於公眾真的沒有知情的必要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

497. Well, I beg to differ.
→ {"text": "嗯，我不敢苟同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

498. I do think that citizens in a free republic, if they are to govern, which is the basic idea, do have a need to know about the important things in their world.
