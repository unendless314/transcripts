303. You're on, Captain. Thank you for coming.
→ {"text": "上尉，請開始。感謝您的到來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. Thank you. If we have time, I have some pictures and graphics of the LCFs and the LFs and the LCCs if we have time for it. It's not really pertinent, but I thought you might like a little tour of the facilities.
→ {"text": "謝謝。如果我們有時間的話，我有一些發射控制設施（LCF）、發射設施（LF）和發射控制中心（LCC）的圖片和圖表。這不是特別相關，但我想各位可能會想簡單參觀一下這些設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. We have them as a slide for paper or on our screen?
→ {"text": "我們是有紙本投影片還是在螢幕上？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. I was a captain in the Air Force and a Minuteman III combat crew commander from 1974 to 1977.
→ {"text": "我曾是空軍上尉，從 1974 年到 1977 年擔任民兵三型（Minuteman III）戰鬥組指揮官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. I was stationed at FE Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming and assigned to the 400th Strategic Missile Squadron.
→ {"text": "我駐紮於懷俄明州 F.E. Warren 空軍基地，被分配到第 400 戰略飛彈中隊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. Quite honestly, I was and still remain a skeptic and at the time did not believe in this UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "坦白說，我當時是、現在仍然是個懷疑論者，那時候我並不相信這種 UFO 現象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. In the fall of '76, my deputy and I were on duty at Romeo Launch Facility, or LCF.
→ {"text": "1976 年秋天，我的副手和我在 Romeo 發射設施（LCF）值勤。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. The LCF was the part of Romeo that was above the ground, as we saw with David Scindelli, and the launch control capsule was the one that we took an elevator down to.
→ {"text": "發射設施是 Romeo 的地面部分，就像我們剛才在 David Scindelli 那裡看到的，而發射控制艙室則是我們搭電梯下去的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Whisper 錯誤 Schindley 改為 Scindelli"}

313. It was located 60 feet below the ground and behind an 8-ton door, so we were pretty secure in there.
→ {"text": "它位於地下 60 英呎，在一扇 8 噸重的門後面，所以我們在裡面相當安全。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. In order to stay awake, my deputy and I were monitoring the VHF radio communication between our security alert team, which we friendly called the COPS.
→ {"text": "為了保持清醒，我的副手和我監聽著我們的安全警戒小組的甚高頻無線電通訊，我們親切地稱他們為「警察」（COPS）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. David was one of them, David Scott, and between our flight security controller, FSC, our topside NCO.
→ {"text": "David 是其中之一，David Scott，以及我們的飛行安全管制員（FSC），我們的地面士官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. The SAT team was out doing their regular routine checks. I think they were responding to one of those jackrabbits at one of our launch facilities.
→ {"text": "安全警戒小組（SAT）正在外面進行例行檢查。我想他們正在回應我們某個發射設施的野兔警報之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "野兔常觸發感應器造成誤報"}

317. So they were out and away. At approximately 2 a.m., the FSC called the SAT and said, "Hey, pull over. Get out of the vehicle and look around."
→ {"text": "所以他們在外面執行任務。大約凌晨兩點，飛行安全管制員呼叫安全警戒小組說：「嘿，靠邊停車。下車看看周圍。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. That's all he said. Gave no direction or any guidance.
→ {"text": "他就只說了這些。沒有給任何方向或指示。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

319. A few seconds, and he also said, "See what you see."
→ {"text": "幾秒鐘後，他又說：「看看你們看到什麼。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. A few seconds later, they reported they saw nothing, and they said, "Oops, wait a minute. We do see something in the distance."
→ {"text": "幾秒鐘後，他們報告說什麼也沒看到，然後他們說：「哎呀，等等。我們確實在遠處看到了什麼。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. The FSC, "Well, what do you see?" And they said in an excited voice, "It was a light in the sky. It was a bright white pulsating light, and they could see some other colors in between the pulsations."
→ {"text": "飛行安全管制員問：「那麼，你們看到什麼？」他們用興奮的聲音說：「是天空中的一道光。是一道明亮的白色脈動光，他們能在脈動之間看到一些其他顏色。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. The FSC asked them where the light was located, and the reply was that it was some distance to the north.
→ {"text": "飛行安全管制員問他們光在哪裡，回答是在北邊某個距離。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. And then after a pause, they said, "Geez, it really looks like it's near the LCF or near where you are."
→ {"text": "然後停頓了一下，他們說：「天啊，它看起來真的就在發射控制設施附近，或者就在你所在的地方附近。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. The FSC then asked the SAT to return back to the launch control facility.
→ {"text": "飛行安全管制員隨後要求安全警戒小組返回發射控制設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. My deputy and I kind of looked at each other and did a double take because what the heck was that all about?
→ {"text": "我的副手和我互看了一眼，感到非常驚訝，因為這到底是怎麼回事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. So we called the FSC on our hotline and asked them what was going on. He very calmly said that right now, right above the LCF, there was a silent object with a very white pulsating light between the pulsations.
→ {"text": "所以我們用熱線電話呼叫飛行安全管制員，問他發生了什麼事。他非常平靜地說，就在現在，就在發射控制設施的正上方，有一個無聲的物體，發出非常明亮的白色脈動光，脈動之間還有其他顏色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. He could see a red and blue. I asked for specifics, and his best guess, well, he said it was a fat cigar. It looked like a fat cigar.
→ {"text": "他能看到紅色和藍色。我要求他說得具體一點，他最好的描述是，嗯，他說它像一根粗雪茄。它看起來像一根粗雪茄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. And his best guess was that it was 80 to 100 feet above the ground and 40 to 50 feet long.
→ {"text": "他的最佳估計是它離地面 80 到 100 英呎高，長度為 40 到 50 英呎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. It was hard to see his perspective exactly because he didn't know if it was way high, it could have been 1,000 feet long. If it was way low, it could have been less, but that was his best guess.
→ {"text": "很難確定他的視角，因為他不知道如果它非常高，它可能長達 1，000 英呎。如果它很低，可能會更短，但這是他的最佳估計。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. While we were talking, he reported that it was moving down the access road to the east and very slowly and very quietly.
→ {"text": "在我們通話期間，他報告說它正沿著通道向東移動，非常緩慢，非常安靜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. I asked him to keep us updated. My deputy and I talked about what we should do with this information.
→ {"text": "我要求他隨時向我們更新情況。我的副手和我討論該如何處理這個資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. In a few minutes, the FSC called back and said the object could stop a few miles to the east and appeared to be above the closest launch facility, our LF.
→ {"text": "幾分鐘後，飛行安全管制員回電說該物體停在東邊幾英里處，似乎在最近的發射設施，也就是我們的發射設施上方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. So we ordered the SAT team, who was now on their way back to the launch control facility, to go to that LF that had the object above it, and they said they had to return to the launch control facility for batteries and for their flashlights.
→ {"text": "所以我們命令正在返回發射控制設施的安全警戒小組前往那個物體上方的發射設施，他們說必須先返回發射控制設施拿電池和手電筒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. Ten minutes or so later, we asked the status of the SAT team, and we were told that they made it back to the LCF, but not had departed yet. They were just about ready to go.
→ {"text": "大約十分鐘後，我們詢問安全警戒小組的狀態，被告知他們已經回到發射控制設施，但還沒有出發。他們正準備出發。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. The object moved further east along the access road above another LF. We again ordered the SAT team to that location, and they reported they had the first gas up their truck.
→ {"text": "該物體沿著通道進一步向東移動到另一個發射設施上方。我們再次命令安全警戒小組前往該地點，他們報告說必須先給卡車加油。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. It seemed to take them a long time before they appeared to be on their way.
→ {"text": "他們似乎花了很長時間才準備出發。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. Shortly after the object went to the first launch facility, we reported the incident to our SAC command post at F.E. Warren, and the NCO that took the call laughed at us and said, "Call us back when that thing eats the SAT team," and hung up.
→ {"text": "在該物體前往第一個發射設施後不久，我們向 F.E. Warren 的戰略空軍司令部指揮所報告了這起事件，接電話的士官嘲笑我們說：「等那東西把安全警戒小組吃掉時再打給我們。」然後就掛斷了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Whisper 錯誤：SAT command post 改為 SAC command post"}

338. As well as logging everything in the official log, my deputy and I, who each had prior service, meaning we were enlisted before we were an officer, we started taking personal notes. In addition to the official notes, we wanted to document everything that transpired.
→ {"text": "除了在正式日誌中記錄一切之外，我的副手和我（我們都有服役經歷，意思是在成為軍官之前曾是士兵）開始做個人筆記。除了正式記錄，我們想記錄發生的一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. At our next hourly 400th SMS crew check for the flights Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, and Tango, we told the other crew members what our object had done and received laughter and an attitude of general disbelief.
→ {"text": "在我們下一次第 400 戰略飛彈中隊的每小時組員檢查時，針對 Papa、Quebec、Romeo、Sierra 和 Tango 飛行中隊，我們告訴其他組員我們看到的物體做了什麼，卻收到嘲笑和普遍的不相信態度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

340. What are you guys crazy? Right after the group communication, the crew from Quebec called.
→ {"text": "你們瘋了嗎？就在集體通訊結束後，Quebec 飛行中隊的組員打來電話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. They were the team we had dropped off on the way to Romeo and said that earlier that morning they had a similar object above a couple of their launch facilities.
→ {"text": "他們是我們在前往 Romeo 途中送達的組員，他們說當天早上稍早時在他們的幾個發射設施上方看到了類似的物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. We asked what direction they were heading, and they said that they appeared to be heading towards me at Romeo.
→ {"text": "我們問物體朝哪個方向移動，他們說似乎朝著我所在的 Romeo 方向移動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. We asked what happened when they reported it, and they said, "Are you crazy? We didn't report it. We would have been laughed at."
→ {"text": "我們問他們報告時發生了什麼，他們說：「你瘋了嗎？我們沒有報告。我們會被嘲笑的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. Well, he was right about that. They also mentioned that the SAT team that they had sent to one of the LFs had had an accident leaving the LF, and the Quebec crew seemed to find humor in that sad accident, and that's important for what happens a few years later.
→ {"text": "嗯，他說得對。他們還提到他們派往其中一個發射設施的安全警戒小組在離開發射設施時發生了事故，Quebec 飛行中隊的組員似乎對那起悲傷的事故感到有趣，這對幾年後發生的事情很重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. We contacted the FE Warren SAC command post again several times and reported, "Have you logged this yet?"
→ {"text": "我們多次再度聯繫 F.E. Warren 的戰略空軍司令部指揮所並報告：「你們記錄這件事了嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. They said, "No." I pushed it forward, got an officer in charge, and stated that if they didn't log this, if they didn't take this seriously, I was going to call the base commander. It was now 3 o'clock in the morning, and the base commander would have not liked getting woken at 3 o'clock, but I would have.
→ {"text": "他們說：「沒有。」我堅持要求，找到了一位值班軍官，並表示如果他們不記錄這件事，如果他們不認真對待，我就要打電話給基地指揮官。當時已經是凌晨三點，基地指揮官不會喜歡在三點被吵醒，但我會這麼做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. Then we got a call back from a senior NCO at the command post asking for more details, so they appeared to be logging it.
→ {"text": "然後我們接到指揮所一位資深士官的回電，詢問更多細節，所以他們似乎正在記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. The object moved to another LF, and the SAT team never made it to that one either.
→ {"text": "該物體移動到另一個發射設施，安全警戒小組也沒有到達那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. Our FSC kept us to praise of each movement and reported that at 4 a.m., approximately, it moved away very rapidly to a star-sized object and then disappeared.
→ {"text": "我們的飛行安全管制員持續向我們更新每次移動的情況，並報告說大約在凌晨四點，它迅速移動變成星星大小的物體，然後消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. At no time did our missiles go offline, though. At no time did our missiles go offline, and I now understand why. Only recent information came out for that.
→ {"text": "不過，我們的導彈從未失效。我們的導彈從未失效，我現在明白為什麼了。只是最近才有相關資訊出現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. Meanwhile, back in 1976, the next morning, we were relieved by another crew for a normal return to LFE Warren, and when we went topside, we found the FSC curled up in a chair in kind of a fetal position.
→ {"text": "與此同時，回到 1976 年，隔天早上，我們被另一組人員接班，正常返回 F.E. Warren，當我們回到地面時，我們發現飛行安全管制員蜷縮在椅子上，呈現胎兒姿勢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

352. He had been relieved by the day FSC, but was not able to sleep and obviously was very distressed.
→ {"text": "他已經被日班飛行安全管制員接班，但無法入睡，顯然非常痛苦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. The SAT members were conveniently not at the LCF. My deputy and I were both by our service and had a good rapport with our FSC, and we asked him about the difficulty that the SAT team had about going to the LFs.
→ {"text": "安全警戒小組成員恰好不在發射控制設施。我的副手和我都有服役經歷，與我們的飛行安全管制員關係良好，我們問他關於安全警戒小組前往發射設施的困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. After making us promise that we would not report the SAT, he told us that, in fact, they never left the launch control facility, and they said they were not going to any LF that had that thing above it.
→ {"text": "在讓我們承諾不會報告安全警戒小組之後，他告訴我們，事實上，他們從未離開發射控制設施，他們說不會去任何有那東西在上方的發射設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. So we picked up our crew member from Quebec, and we returned trip to FE Warren and discussed the excitement of that early morning hours.
→ {"text": "所以我們接上來自 Quebec 的組員，返回 F.E. Warren，並討論那天凌晨的激動經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. They insisted they would not report the incident and that if we reported it, they would deny that it happened.
→ {"text": "他們堅持不會報告這起事件，如果我們報告，他們會否認發生過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. If we reported their involvement in it, they would deny that it happened.
→ {"text": "如果我們報告他們的參與，他們會否認發生過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. Upon our return to our squadron, we reported the incident with our flight commander, and the next morning we were called in by the commander of the 400th SMS.
→ {"text": "返回我們的中隊後，我們向飛行指揮官報告了這起事件，隔天早上我們被第 400 戰略飛彈中隊的指揮官召見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

359. He asked us about the incident, and when he discovered we had personal notes, he asked to see them.
→ {"text": "他問我們關於這起事件，當他發現我們有個人筆記時，他要求查看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. Once in his hands, he tore them up and said we were never to talk about this again and required us to sign documents that I'm a little fuzzy about what they really said.
→ {"text": "一旦拿到手，他就撕毀了筆記，說我們絕不能再談論這件事，並要求我們簽署文件，我對那些文件的真正內容有點模糊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. We reluctantly signed them after going into a broom closet to talk about it for 10 minutes.
→ {"text": "在進入雜物間討論了十分鐘後，我們不情願地簽署了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. At our next couple of departure meetings, an officer that we'd never seen before told us that this incident was classified and that it officially never happened, and I always wanted to question which was it.
→ {"text": "在接下來的幾次出發會議上，一位我們從未見過的軍官告訴我們這起事件是機密的，官方上它從未發生過，我一直想質問到底是怎樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. Was it classified or did it happen?
→ {"text": "它是機密的，還是它從未發生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. After a press conference in September 2010, I was given a name of a former Quebec SAT team that wanted to talk to me.
→ {"text": "在 2010 年 9 月的一次新聞發布會後，我得到了一位前 Quebec 安全警戒小組成員的名字，他想和我談談。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. I contacted and heard a story, and I'm confident he was one of the SAT members on duty that night at our incident Romeo.
→ {"text": "我聯繫了他並聽到了一個故事，我確信他是當晚在我們 Romeo 事件中值勤的安全警戒小組成員之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. This is what he told me.

367. As they approached the Quebec 9 in their vehicle, they saw a bright pulsating light with a beam of light extending down to the launch facility.
→ {"text": "當他們駕車接近 Quebec 9 時，他們看到一道明亮的脈動光，光束向下延伸到發射設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. While attempting to accomplishing one of their many checklists, SAT is known for their checklist, he actually reached into the beam. That spooked both of the SAT members, and they jumped in their truck, and as they raced away, they had an accident, and the truck was damaged.
→ {"text": "在嘗試完成他們眾多檢查清單之一時（安全警戒小組以檢查清單聞名），他實際上伸手進入光束。這嚇壞了兩名安全警戒小組成員，他們跳上卡車，當他們快速逃離時，發生了事故，卡車受損。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. That tied into me that that, in fact, was the Quebec team that was on duty that night when my Quebec commanders told me that their SAT team had an accident, so I was confident they were them.
→ {"text": "這讓我確信，事實上，這就是當晚值勤的 Quebec 小組，因為我的 Quebec 指揮官告訴我他們的安全警戒小組發生了事故，所以我確信就是他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我問他，你知道，當他們回到 F.E. Warren 時，他們被其他安全警戒小組成員嘲笑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. Someone even drew a drawing of them seeing a UFO, hitting a cow, drinking booze, and they were ridiculed for their time, and this guy was really, to this day, upset about that ridicule.
→ {"text": "甚至有人畫了一幅畫，畫他們看到 UFO、撞到牛、喝酒，他們長期被嘲笑，這個人直到今天對那些嘲笑真的很生氣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. I asked him to share his story with others and make a formal statement, and he said, "No, this is it."
→ {"text": "我請他與他人分享他的故事並做正式陳述，他說：「不，就這樣了。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. He was done, and he would not talk to anybody about this again, including me, and he, in fact, has not responded to any calls or emails from me.
→ {"text": "他結束了，他不會再與任何人談論此事，包括我，事實上，他沒有回覆我的任何電話或電子郵件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我對這起 1976 年的事件保持沉默。畢竟，一個好軍官會遵守他或她的命令。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "1960應為1976的口誤"}

375. I caught Larry King live on a Friday night on July 18th of 2008, and I came in at a segment, and I saw a former Air Force officer talking about a similar situation.
→ {"text": "2008 年 7 月 18 日星期五晚上，我碰巧看到《賴瑞金現場》（Larry King Live），我看到一個片段，一位前空軍軍官正在談論類似的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. I did not get the beginning of the segment, as I think I said.
→ {"text": "我沒有看到片段的開頭，我想我說過了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. This guy's name was Bob Salas, and I thought he was one of the crew members from Quebec.
→ {"text": "這個人的名字是 Bob Salas，我以為他是 Quebec 飛行中隊的組員之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. He was describing my incident, you know, and then I found out, in fact, his happened in 1967.
→ {"text": "你知道，他在描述我的事件，然後我發現，事實上，他的事件發生在 1967 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. Malmstrom Air Force Base, not F.E. Warren.
→ {"text": "馬姆斯特羅姆空軍基地（Malmstrom Air Force Base），不是 F.E. Warren。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Whisper 錯誤的轉錄"}

380. A skeptic on that show did not believe Mr. Salas' story and seemed to doubt his credibility, his honesty, and his sanity.
→ {"text": "節目上的一位懷疑論者不相信 Salas 先生的故事，似乎懷疑他的可信度、誠實和理智。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. After much thought, much later, I contacted one of the guests on the show, Robert Hastings, and over time, it took me like four months to get up the information, and I slowly came out first anonymously, came forward first anonymously, first with my first name, and then I said, "What the heck? If they come after me, they come after me."
→ {"text": "經過深思熟慮，很久之後，我聯繫了節目中的一位嘉賓羅伯特·黑斯廷斯（Robert Hastings），隨著時間推移，我花了大約四個月的時間來提供資訊，我慢慢地先以匿名方式出現，首先只透露我的名字，然後我說：「管他的，如果他們要來找我，就來吧。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. Because I had the same trepidation that you did.

383. Would I lose my pension? Would I disappear? Et cetera.
→ {"text": "我會失去退休金嗎？我會消失嗎？諸如此類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

384. So, here I am. This is what led to this. [applause] I served on the Armed Services Committee as well as the Air Force Academy Board for six years of my 14 years in the Congress.
→ {"text": "所以，我在這裡。這就是導致這一切的原因。[掌聲] 我在國會的 14 年中，有 6 年在軍事委員會（Armed Services Committee）以及空軍學院委員會（Air Force Academy Board）任職。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "委員會發言"}

385. I know the pressure that you're under. I know when you sign those things, they're like for life.
→ {"text": "我知道你們承受的壓力。我知道當你簽署那些東西時，它們就像是終身的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
