302. Fenstermacher.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. You're on, Captain. Thank you for coming.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. Thank you. If we have time, I have some pictures and graphics of the LCFs and the LFs and the LCCs if we have time for it. It's not really pertinent, but I thought you might like a little tour of the facilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. We have them as a slide for paper or on our screen?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. On the screen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. Okay. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. I was a captain in the Air Force and a Minuteman III combat crew commander from 1974 to 1977.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. I was stationed at FE Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming and assigned to the 400th Strategic Missile Squadron.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. Quite honestly, I was and still remain a skeptic and at the time did not believe in this UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. In the fall of '76, my deputy and I were on duty at Romeo Launch Facility, or LCF.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. The LCF was the part of Romeo that was above the ground, as we saw with David Scindelli, and the launch control capsule was the one that we took an elevator down to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. It was located 60 feet below the ground and behind an 8-ton door, so we were pretty secure in there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. In order to stay awake, my deputy and I were monitoring the VHF radio communication between our security alert team, which we friendly called the COPS.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. David was one of them, David Scott, and between our flight security controller, FSC, our topside NCO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. The SAT team was out doing their regular routine checks. I think they were responding to one of those jackrabbits at one of our launch facilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. So they were out and away. At approximately 2 a.m., the FSC called the SAT and said, "Hey, pull over. Get out of the vehicle and look around."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. That's all he said. Gave no direction or any guidance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. A few seconds, and he also said, "See what you see."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. A few seconds later, they reported they saw nothing, and they said, "Oops, wait a minute. We do see something in the distance."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. The FSC, "Well, what do you see?" And they said in an excited voice, "It was a light in the sky. It was a bright white pulsating light, and they could see some other colors in between the pulsations."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. The FSC asked them where the light was located, and the reply was that it was some distance to the north.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. And then after a pause, they said, "Geez, it really looks like it's near the LCF or near where you are."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. The FSC then asked the SAT to return back to the launch control facility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. My deputy and I kind of looked at each other and did a double take because what the heck was that all about?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. So we called the FSC on our hotline and asked them what was going on. He very calmly said that right now, right above the LCF, there was a silent object with a very white pulsating light between the pulsations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. He could see a red and blue. I asked for specifics, and his best guess, well, he said it was a fat cigar. It looked like a fat cigar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. And his best guess was that it was 80 to 100 feet above the ground and 40 to 50 feet long.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. It was hard to see his perspective exactly because he didn't know if it was way high, it could have been 1,000 feet long. If it was way low, it could have been less, but that was his best guess.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. While we were talking, he reported that it was moving down the access road to the east and very slowly and very quietly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. I asked him to keep us updated. My deputy and I talked about what we should do with this information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. In a few minutes, the FSC called back and said the object could stop a few miles to the east and appeared to be above the closest launch facility, our LF.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. So we ordered the SAT team, who was now on their way back to the launch control facility, to go to that LF that had the object above it, and they said they had to return to the launch control facility for batteries and for their flashlights.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. Ten minutes or so later, we asked the status of the SAT team, and we were told that they made it back to the LCF, but not had departed yet. They were just about ready to go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. The object moved further east along the access road above another LF. We again ordered the SAT team to that location, and they reported they had the first gas up their truck.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. It seemed to take them a long time before they appeared to be on their way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. Shortly after the object went to the first launch facility, we reported the incident to our SAC command post at F.E. Warren, and the NCO that took the call laughed at us and said, "Call us back when that thing eats the SAT team," and hung up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. As well as logging everything in the official log, my deputy and I, who each had prior service, meaning we were enlisted before we were an officer, we started taking personal notes. In addition to the official notes, we wanted to document everything that transpired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. At our next hourly 400th SMS crew check for the flights Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, and Tango, we told the other crew members what our object had done and received laughter and an attitude of general disbelief.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. What are you guys crazy? Right after the group communication, the crew from Quebec called.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. They were the team we had dropped off on the way to Romeo and said that earlier that morning they had a similar object above a couple of their launch facilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. We asked what direction they were heading, and they said that they appeared to be heading towards me at Romeo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. We asked what happened when they reported it, and they said, "Are you crazy? We didn't report it. We would have been laughed at."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. Well, he was right about that. They also mentioned that the SAT team that they had sent to one of the LFs had had an accident leaving the LF, and the Quebec crew seemed to find humor in that sad accident, and that's important for what happens a few years later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. We contacted the FE Warren SAC command post again several times and reported, "Have you logged this yet?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. They said, "No." I pushed it forward, got an officer in charge, and stated that if they didn't log this, if they didn't take this seriously, I was going to call the base commander. It was now 3 o'clock in the morning, and the base commander would have not liked getting woken at 3 o'clock, but I would have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. Then we got a call back from a senior NCO at the command post asking for more details, so they appeared to be logging it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. The object moved to another LF, and the SAT team never made it to that one either.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. Our FSC kept us to praise of each movement and reported that at 4 a.m., approximately, it moved away very rapidly to a star-sized object and then disappeared.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. At no time did our missiles go offline, though. At no time did our missiles go offline, and I now understand why. Only recent information came out for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. Meanwhile, back in 1976, the next morning, we were relieved by another crew for a normal return to LFE Warren, and when we went topside, we found the FSC curled up in a chair in kind of a fetal position.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. He had been relieved by the day FSC, but was not able to sleep and obviously was very distressed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. The SAT members were conveniently not at the LCF. My deputy and I were both by our service and had a good rapport with our FSC, and we asked him about the difficulty that the SAT team had about going to the LFs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. After making us promise that we would not report the SAT, he told us that, in fact, they never left the launch control facility, and they said they were not going to any LF that had that thing above it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. So we picked up our crew member from Quebec, and we returned trip to FE Warren and discussed the excitement of that early morning hours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. They insisted they would not report the incident and that if we reported it, they would deny that it happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. If we reported their involvement in it, they would deny that it happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. Upon our return to our squadron, we reported the incident with our flight commander, and the next morning we were called in by the commander of the 400th SMS.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. He asked us about the incident, and when he discovered we had personal notes, he asked to see them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. Once in his hands, he tore them up and said we were never to talk about this again and required us to sign documents that I'm a little fuzzy about what they really said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. We reluctantly signed them after going into a broom closet to talk about it for 10 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. At our next couple of departure meetings, an officer that we'd never seen before told us that this incident was classified and that it officially never happened, and I always wanted to question which was it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. Was it classified or did it happen?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. After a press conference in September 2010, I was given a name of a former Quebec SAT team that wanted to talk to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. I contacted and heard a story, and I'm confident he was one of the SAT members on duty that night at our incident Romeo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. This is what he told me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. As they approached the Quebec 9 in their vehicle, they saw a bright pulsating light with a beam of light extending down to the launch facility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. While attempting to accomplishing one of their many checklists, SAT is known for their checklist, he actually reached into the beam. That spooked both of the SAT members, and they jumped in their truck, and as they raced away, they had an accident, and the truck was damaged.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. That tied into me that that, in fact, was the Quebec team that was on duty that night when my Quebec commanders told me that their SAT team had an accident, so I was confident they were them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. I asked, you know, when they got back to F.E. Warren, they were ridiculed by the fellow SAT members.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. Someone even drew a drawing of them seeing a UFO, hitting a cow, drinking booze, and they were ridiculed for their time, and this guy was really, to this day, upset about that ridicule.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. I asked him to share his story with others and make a formal statement, and he said, "No, this is it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. He was done, and he would not talk to anybody about this again, including me, and he, in fact, has not responded to any calls or emails from me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. I kept silence about this 1960-1976 incident. After all, a good officer follows his or her orders.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. I caught Larry King live on a Friday night on July 18th of 2008, and I came in at a segment, and I saw a former Air Force officer talking about a similar situation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. I did not get the beginning of the segment, as I think I said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. This guy's name was Bob Salas, and I thought he was one of the crew members from Quebec.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. He was describing my incident, you know, and then I found out, in fact, his happened in 1967.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. Malmstrom Air Force Base, not F.E. Warren.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. A skeptic on that show did not believe Mr. Salas' story and seemed to doubt his credibility, his honesty, and his sanity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. After much thought, much later, I contacted one of the guests on the show, Robert Hastings, and over time, it took me like four months to get up the information, and I slowly came out first anonymously, came forward first anonymously, first with my first name, and then I said, "What the heck? If they come after me, they come after me."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Because I had the same trepidation that you did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. Would I lose my pension? Would I disappear? Et cetera.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. So, here I am. This is what led to this. [applause] I served on the Armed Services Committee as well as the Air Force Academy Board for six years of my 14 years in the Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. I know the pressure that you're under. I know when you sign those things, they're like for life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. So, I appreciate all your courage and your service, and we all do as a body in the House of Representatives and Senate as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
