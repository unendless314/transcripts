## Speaker Group 1

1. I would like to call the afternoon session of our hearing Citizens Hearing on Disclosure to order.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

2. Gentlemen, if you would rise and repeat after me, I'd appreciate it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

3. I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

4. And nothing but the truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

5. To this committee today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

6. To this committee today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

7. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

8. We'll begin with Captain Robert Salas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. Am I pronouncing that right, sir?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. Salas is correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. Thank you, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. Mr. Kilpatrick and panel, I would first like to briefly describe the incident that I experienced in March 1967.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. At that time, I was a First Lieutenant, U.S. Air Force Station at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. I was trained in assigned duties as a missile launch officer for the Minuteman I intercontinental ballistic missile.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. I was designated Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander and part of a two-man crew.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. My commander at that time was Lieutenant Frederick Mywald.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. He's now deceased.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. I will briefly review the -- well, the diagrams showing the launch control center, the launch facility we will show you shortly when one of the other speakers present.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. We were on duty inside the Oscar Launch Control Center, a concrete capsule located about 60 feet underground.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. We had operational control over 10 Minuteman nuclear missiles.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. Each missile operates independently and has its own source of primary and backup power systems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. It is important for you to note that the command and control for these missiles was entirely located within the capsule.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. There was absolutely no means to affect any of the missile systems from outside the capsule.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. On the evening of March 24, 1967, while my commander was on a scheduled rest break, I received the first of two phone calls from my topside flight security controller, FSC.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. The first call was to report unidentified lighted objects flying above the facility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. They reported they were flying at very high speeds, making very odd maneuvers, nothing that an aircraft could do, and they just wanted to report it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. I didn't pay much attention to that first call, and I basically hung up on them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. Just later, the FSC phoned again and reported in a very agitated state that there was a large oval-shaped object hovering above the front gate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. It was a red pulsating lighted object, approximately 30, 40 feet in diameter, the best he could describe it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. It was difficult to distinguish a structural part of it on the inside, except that it was a glowing red pulsating object.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. He had all the men out there with their weapons drawn, and he wanted me to tell him what to do next.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. I, of course, told him something like, "Make sure nothing comes inside the perimeter fence."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. Of course, our primary duty was to secure those nuclear missiles.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. Immediately after that call, I started to inform my commander about the incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. As I started to inform my commander, our missiles began to shut down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. We lost alert status on all 10 missiles while this object was above our facility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. When we queried the fault system, all missiles reported guidance and control system failure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. We had a way of querying faults within the system called VERSA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. It's a voice activated system, and we were getting channels 9 and 12, which is guidance and control system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. At the same time, we had indicator lights showing security violations at two of the launch facilities where the missiles were physically located.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. While Lieutenant Mywald reported the incident to the Wing Command post, I phoned upstairs and directed the security alert team to be sent to those launch facilities with security violations to investigate those indications.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. At that time, the FSC reported to me that the object had flown off at high speed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. When the security alert team arrived at the affected LFs, LFs meaning launch facilities, they reported seeing the object hovering over those sites.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. As they approached closer to the object, they lost all communications with the FSC.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. After speaking to the Wing Command post, Lieutenant Mywald informed me that the same thing happened at another flight.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. At that time, I assumed that meant that night, but it turns out what he meant was it happened at another flight about a week earlier, and that's the Echo flight incident, which I'll talk about shortly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. Right now, I'd like you to hear the portion of the conversation I had with Colonel Mywald, who retired as a full colonel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. I had this conversation sometime in 1996.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. Can we play the first audio, please?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. Because they were doing maintenance on, I don't know, the guidance cans or something, and I had a conversation with Colonel Mywald and he said, "You know what, I'm going to tell you something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. This is the first time that I've ever heard of this, and I've never heard of it before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. I've never heard of it before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. He said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. I said, "I've never heard of it before."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. And he described the fact that on two of his launch facilities, he had maintenance crews out there and security guards.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. And when the first missile went down in his flight, they reported that there were UFOs overhead as the missiles went down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. He lost all 10 of his missiles in rapid succession.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. That incident occurred on March 16th, 1967.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. He launched them and they went down?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. No, no, the missiles were not launched.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. They reported that the objects were above them, and at that point the missiles started shutting down, disabled.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. The second audio recording you heard was that of Colonel Mywald talking about the fact that we had security light violations and we had to send guards out to one or more of the LFs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. And they reported seeing the UFOs again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. By the way, I've got more audio available that's where Colonel Mywald supports my entire statement about what occurred.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. So he was consistent on supporting this up until the time he passed away last year.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. After we were relieved by another crew the next morning, right back to the base, we reported to the squadron commander's office.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. There we were ordered to sign non-disclosure statements regarding our specific incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. I did sign a non-disclosure statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. And we were ordered not to talk to anybody about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. It was then designated a highly classified incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. At no time did we lose power during the incident, I want to emphasize.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. We always had electrical power.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. The sensitive information network, SIN cables that carried the signals to the missile systems were triply shielded from electromagnetic interference.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. The preliminary investigation isolated the failure to the logic coupler at each missile.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. The logic coupler is associated with the missile guidance system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. That's about the best I can explain to you what the logic coupler does.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. I'll refer you to a portion of the unit wing history.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. I believe you have documents that I supplied you with that talk about the echo flight incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. I'll just read part of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. It says in the opinion of the team was that externally generated signals caused the generation of these two channels and shut down the launch facilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. The possibility of this is very remote due to the fact that all ten couplers would have to fail in the flight within a few seconds of each other.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. This statement confirms that signals were sent to each individual missile separately in order to disable them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. From my knowledge of the operating system at the time, neither I nor the investigative team could define the method or means by which these signals were sent to disable the missiles each in the same manner, meaning each missile failed for the same reason, guidance and control system failure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. Mr. Robert Kaminsky was the Boeing team leader for the investigation of the echo flight shutdown.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. In a response to our inquiry, he stated this kind of event is virtually impossible once the system was up and running.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. The team met with me to report their findings and it was decided that the final report would have nothing significant in it to explain what happened at echo flight.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. Just one moment, Captain. We did not explain it. Just working with my congressional research assistant on the end of the table, we are going to allow ten minutes for each of you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. I'm not sure. I just got the time sign for the captain and I don't believe that he's been talking ten minutes, has he?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. He has.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. He has been talking ten minutes. Captain, can you -- and since we didn't let you know ahead of time, I'm going to give you additional three minutes if that's okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. Thank you very much. I'll try to get through it as quickly as I can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. That's okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. After meeting with the engineers to discuss the results of their investigation, Mr. Kaminsky was notified by his supervisor that he should not submit his final report because the incident was reported to be a UFO event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. Even though the Boeing company was the principal contractor for the Minuteman missile, the report on the incident was not submitted by specific request of the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. However, the Air Force did perform their own classified investigation where they identified a possible failure mode as stated above.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. In my opinion, we did not have the technical capability to produce a machine then or now that would be able to instigate the failure mode of these missiles identified in the unit wing history.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. In addition, the unidentified objects displayed the physical and flight characteristics that no known aircraft type could achieve then or now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. Therefore, I have concluded these objects were non-terrestrial in origin. An important related activity ongoing, and this is important, on December 17, 1969, the official U.S. Air Force investigation to the UFO phenomenon was terminated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. The principal basis for this, and you have the Air Force position on UFOs, I believe, I've given you a copy of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. The principal basis for this termination was the evaluation of a report prepared by the University of Colorado entitled "Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. In 1966, the U.S. Air Force awarded a half million dollar contract to the University of Colorado for the purpose of studying the UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. I'll refer to this study as the Condon investigation for its team leader, Edward Condon. In fact, it was never intended to be a scientific study because the Air Force did not propose that any scientific hypothesis regarding the phenomenon be evaluated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. The Condon team relied on input and evaluations of report UFO incidents from Air Force officers at various bases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. The Condon team was, except for one individual, not authorized to review classified reports of Air Force incidents regarding the phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. They were not even informed that classified UFO files existed until after the termination of their study. I have evidence supporting this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. With respect to the 1967 Echo and Oscar flight UFO incidents, there was a deliberate effort to keep information about those incidents from the Condon committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. In 1967, Dr. Roy Craig, the chief investigator for the Condon committee, was informed by Mr. Raymond Fowler, a contractor working for Sylvania on Minuteman Electrical Systems, that the Echo flight shutdowns at Malmstrom had occurred during UFO sighting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. In October '67, he visited Malmstrom to inquire about this. Dr. Craig recalls this inquiry with Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Chase, the base operations officer at Malmstrom.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. After Colonel Chase hinted, I had exchanged pleasantries in his office. This is a quotation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. I asked him about the Echo incident. The Colonel caught his breath and expressed surprise that I knew of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. I can't talk about that, he said. Colonel Chase had assured me that the incident had not involved the UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. Since Colonel Chase was the last man I would doubt, when he conveyed this information, I accepted the information as factual and turned the review over to Bob Lowe, who had received -- Robert Lowe was the project coordinator, and he was the only one cleared to look at classified information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. When Dr. Robert Lowe, the deputy accountant, requested the Air Force allow him to review the secret report of the Echo incident, he was informed that the report would be too highly classified to allow that review.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. Dr. Craig did not review any -- did not interview any of the many witnesses that were named to him by Ray Fowler that he could have interviewed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. He did not interview either of the crews, Echo or Oscar crew.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. In addition, the Air Force officer, Project Blue Book, was deliberately misinformed about these incidents in a letter from Colonel James Manatt, and I think you have these letters in front of you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. He was a right-pat, Blue Book, essentially.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. A request of Colonel Chase in June of '67 inquired of reports they had received that there were equipment malfunctions and abnormalities during the UFO sightings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. The written reply from Colonel Chase stated, "This office has no knowledge of equipment malfunctions and abnormalities in equipment during the period of UFO sightings."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. This evidence and the Air Force -- Captain, I think you just have a short piece to go, is that right? Just one page left?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. Just very short. Yes, sir. Please proceed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. I'm almost done. Please proceed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. And by the way, this is a very complex case. Absolutely. We can tell. Yes, sir. Thank you, and we appreciate your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. This is evidence that the Air Force purposefully denied the con investigators the knowledge that the Echo and Oscar flight shutdowns were UFO-related incidents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. Since the Air Force cites this particular study as the primary reason for the official rejection of the UFO phenomenon and claims that no UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force was ever an indication of threat to our national security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. And in light of my own experience and others, I must conclude the U.S. Air Force was and is engaged in lying and disinforming the public about the realities of the UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. That's the end of my statement. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. Very, very briefly, I just want to point out the fact that the next two witnesses that you will hear from, Mr. Scindelli and Mr. Scott, this is the very first time they are going public, and I want to honor these guys for having the courage to do so. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
