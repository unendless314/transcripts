  source_text: This is an explicit Air Force order of 1954-55 saying you are required to get your number of unknowns down
    to a bare minimum. And they did that by hook or crook. Didn't matter. So it became very much a kind of an open joke, to
    be quite frank.

    period of '52 to '67 to even talk about or discuss or take information from captains and sergeants and colonels and even
    generals, any kind of pilots and so on, than they were then?
