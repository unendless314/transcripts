near the town of Mole Hall."},{"segment_id":198,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When the briefing was over, several of the launch crews seated near me commented about the news item, which they had also heard that morning, and there was speculation about a possible connection with November Flight."},{"segment_id":199,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My crew commander had also heard the news item, and we were both anxious and quite curious about what we might find as we drove out to the launch control facility."},{"segment_id":200,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you could display my second slide."},{"segment_id":201,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"On this second slide, I don't believe you members have a picture of this, but you can see it on the screen here."},{"segment_id":202,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is the November launch control facility from an air view from Google Earth."},{"segment_id":203,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There is an access road to the facility from the north coming down to the flight facility, where there's a main gate at the perimeter fence."},{"segment_id":204,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The perimeter fence goes around the launch control facility building topside, and there's a garage to the right of the main gate."},{"segment_id":205,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The usual procedure upon arrival was to inspect the grounds and building, but this time my commander immediately went into the security section of the building to debrief security personnel and guards."},{"segment_id":206,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The security center was the topmost north side of the building near the main gate."},{"segment_id":207,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I entered the facility from the back door at the end of the facility and then encountered the site manager, a tech sergeant, who immediately took me into the day room and asked if I had been briefed on the previous night's events."},{"segment_id":208,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I said I hadn't."},{"segment_id":209,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We then proceeded toward the windows on the west side of the day room, where he described to me the large object with flashing lights that had been hovering just outside the fence that night, and he spread his arms out in front of him to indicate its size, the size of the object."},{"segment_id":210,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Based on his description, I estimated the object may have been 80 to 100 feet wide and approximately 100 feet from the building, maybe a bit closer."},{"segment_id":211,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I immediately asked if it had been a helicopter, and he said that it just hovered with no noise being heard, quite unlike the usual noisy helicopters heard from within the building."},{"segment_id":212,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I also asked what the flashing lights were like, but he could not answer."},{"segment_id":213,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They were unlike any he had ever seen."},{"segment_id":214,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They were not like the usual beacon lights on planes, but something like a pulsating glow."},{"segment_id":215,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He then said the object, while hovering close to the ground, then glided to the right toward the north end of the building and out of sight."},{"segment_id":216,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The object then came into view from the security section of the facility and hovered just behind and slightly to the right of the main gate."},{"segment_id":217,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Concealed partly by the large garage located within the fenced area to the right of the gate."},{"segment_id":218,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As you can see there, the garage is labeled, the second position of the object."},{"segment_id":219,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This location put the object almost directly above the hardened launch control capsule, located 60 feet below ground."},{"segment_id":220,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All our missiles, our 10 missiles, were located 4 to 14 miles away from the launch control facility."},{"segment_id":221,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This capsule was located approximately underneath the garage."},{"segment_id":222,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This was the launch crew quarters and the launch control center for all 10 interconnected nuclear-tipped missiles that were located away from the launch facility."},{"segment_id":223,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Security personnel confirmed everything that the site manager had related to me."},{"segment_id":224,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My commander and I then proceeded to take the elevator down to the launch control center, the capsule, to relieve the two-man officer crew below."},{"segment_id":225,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"After entering the capsule, our eyes were immediately transfixed on the launch control console, which showed that all missiles were off alert and unlaunchable."},{"segment_id":226,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We had never seen such a thing before."},{"segment_id":227,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The outgoing crew briefed us on the wild events that transpired overnight and indicated that the missiles malfunctioned at the time the object was hovering directly above the capsule and next to the main gate."},{"segment_id":228,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We speculated on the possibility of an EMF pulse that might have created the situation."},{"segment_id":229,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We had no doubt, however, that the 10 outlying nuclear-tipped missiles of November flight had been compromised, tampered with, and put out of commission by the object that had paid a visit."},{"segment_id":230,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Normally, it was quite unusual to have even one missile down, except for maintenance, and Wing headquarters was very proud of having more than 95 percent uptime for all 150 missiles of the Wing."},{"segment_id":231,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The following morning, after we had been relieved by the follow-on crew, we arrived Hopside, and I attempted to further query the flight security controller who had been on duty at the time of the situation."},{"segment_id":232,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But he interrupted me, and he said that he had been instructed not to discuss the incident."},{"segment_id":233,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That is when my commander then told me that he had received a call while I was on a scheduled respite break down below, and he told me -- and he was told that we were never to discuss the incident."},{"segment_id":234,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When I asked where the directive came from, he said the OSI."},{"segment_id":235,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He evidently received a call from the OSI."},{"segment_id":236,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"With no discussion allowed on the subject, between him and me together, or with anybody else, my crew commander and I were left in limbo and left on our own to conjure in our own minds how other situations might unfold and be handled."},{"segment_id":237,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Normally, the Air Force would train us on all procedures."},{"segment_id":238,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We were in a simulator constantly training."},{"segment_id":239,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This serious lack of follow-through by the Air Force was more than bewildering, and it served to keep this situation on our minds."},{"segment_id":240,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Together, there were a dozen of us involved with this incident."},{"segment_id":241,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My commander and I were not there during the encounter, but we had to deal with the ramifications of the incident, and I'll never forget the frightened emotion on the faces of topside airmen who were gathered with me when I was briefed by the site manager."},{"segment_id":242,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Besides those of us at the launch control facility, there had to be many more people involved with this, including maintenance people who had to retarget and reline the missiles, also additional security personnel to guard and protect the missile launch facilities, and who knows how many others on base were concerned."},{"segment_id":243,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Everyone had been silenced. The incident was never discussed, and I never heard a word of any other incident from people that I associated with."},{"segment_id":244,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I never spoke a word about my incident for almost 40 years, and my wife never knew."},{"segment_id":245,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"After several years of searching the Internet in the hopes of finding someone who would give me a clue about my incident, I then found what was described by Captain Robert Salas, and I felt immediate joyous freedom from my haunting memory."},{"segment_id":246,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I then informed my wife."},{"segment_id":247,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Since then, I have run across several missileers from my days at Minot who were there with me in the wing, and two of them have gone public with their own experiences."},{"segment_id":248,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Two others have described to me their unique experiences, but they have pleaded that I not divulge their names."},{"segment_id":249,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They fear losing their first pension, are losing their personal integrity and keeping it secret, or have been ridiculed."},{"segment_id":250,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I also know of two other officers involved in incidents, but they will not admit to their secret, probably for the same reasons."},{"segment_id":251,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then there's the late Captain Val Smith of my squadron, who is mentioned in official documents released by FOIA."},{"segment_id":252,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was interviewed by the late Dr. J.

It was almost 25 percent."},{"segment_id":694,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The order came down after the CIA sponsored Robertson Panel, which was at the very end of the Truman administration, to say, that's too high."},{"segment_id":695,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That this problem is too big and we need to knock UFOs out of the public mind. And Blue Book was then gutted and stripped of really all capabilities. And for the rest of its existence, it had no more than a staff of about four or five people with no capability and on strict orders."},{"segment_id":696,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is an explicit Air Force order of 1954-55 saying you are required to get your number of unknowns down to a bare minimum. And they did that by hook or crook. Didn't matter. So it became very much a kind of an open joke, to be quite frank."},{"segment_id":697,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The Blue Book explanations were generally not considered very valid because they were not sufficiently investigated in any scientific way."},{"segment_id":698,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Chair, one quick follow-up question that will take ten seconds to answer."},{"segment_id":699,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is your opinion then, Mr. Dolan, that the Air Force is more reluctant even today than they were during that period of '52 to '67 to even talk about or discuss or take information from captains and sergeants and colonels and even generals, any kind of pilots and so on, than they were then?"},{"segment_id":700,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Absolutely, I believe that. This is a complete nightmare for them to deal with."},{"segment_id":701,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Our final presenter before our break, our ten minute break or so, will be Congresswoman Wolsey. Well, I was sitting here, thank you, all five of you, and Steve who was there before you, getting really uncomfortable about the position this has put you in all these years."},{"segment_id":702,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And honoring you in my heart for getting past that and getting here today and knowing that was not an easy thing to do."},{"segment_id":703,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I wanted to then reflect back on why is this panel, why are we all retired members of Congress?"},{"segment_id":704,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, you know what? We don't have a lot to lose. But it would be, this would be one of the issues that a sitting member would risk losing an election over. 60 second, I mean, ad. And clearance, yeah, to find out data that you have to have clearance for."},{"segment_id":705,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And but then that was the third piece of this is to me and I feel maybe I'm being too optimistic. I think this week is going to change the feeling and respect that the common constituent, the regular member of our country, the population, the populace."},{"segment_id":706,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think if they pay any attention to this, they are going to have a different respect for it. And they'll be able to say it."},{"segment_id":707,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Instead of whispering to me, people who knew that I get teased a lot because I'm the one of the most left progressive members that have left the house, but that was in the house."},{"segment_id":708,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so my constituents, they're really supportive of me. Lucky me. But they would come in and they would whisper, you know, Congresswoman, I think there's something to this."},{"segment_id":709,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I would say, well, if it is or isn't, I'm going to go and find out why we can't find out. And they can count on, you know, that I would do that. But I'm not sure I would have done it if I was a sitting member. I have to be honest with you."},{"segment_id":710,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Ms. Woolsey, may I make a comment? For the last year, we have been sending documents, myself and Mr. Victor Viggiani of ZlandCommunications have been sending documents to Representative Peter King of New York."},{"segment_id":711,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He's got all the documents. He's got my book. He knows my story, but he has not acted on it."},{"segment_id":712,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've also briefed Congressman Rohrabacher, a congressman from California. I think he's still in Congress."},{"segment_id":713,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, he is."},{"segment_id":714,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I briefed him, I think it was the year 2000, and he still hasn't acted on this."},{"segment_id":715,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, there's 433 other members that haven't acted also."},{"segment_id":716,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I hope that this week could make it more comfortable for them and maybe help put the pressure on our government to be more open and to stop covering up and having secret files. So I thank you very much for being here."},{"segment_id":717,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":718,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're going to take a short 8, 10 minute stretch or break for a moment and when we come back we'll conclude for the afternoon."}]
