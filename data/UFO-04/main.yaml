    because I had conversations with him also but one of the things that I found when
    I was working with these folks is that there's a saying in American business everyone
    wants to be first to be second and so in this case there's so many people who
    have had an interest of this but they want to hold back and not speak the whole
    truth about it but I think we need to be able to liberate ourselves to speak the
    truth and it involves many, many complex issues part of which has been touched
