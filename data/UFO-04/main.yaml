    why is it that the non-human intelligence as described in the human abduction syndrome appears to be 100% telepathic with
    the ability to both place impressions in human minds and to also project three dimensional holograms that the human mind
    and I cannot distinguish from the world around us.

    it means weird science and fricking magic and that is the term that's used at the CIA and other places to describe some
    of this and I think that what we have to understand is that if you're dealing with and I do want to go into this because
    this is part of the summary and brief I provided for in the Obama briefing and elsewhere, if you're dealing with civilizations
    that are 10 to the 6th to 10 to the 7th years, hundreds of thousands to millions of years, technologically more developed
    than we are, every manifestation of their technology would look like magic to us.

    that is vast and infinite, that in our own galaxy alone, which has 100 billion star systems, the same number of stars
    as we have neurons in our brain interestingly, that we're dealing with civilizations just in our own galaxy which is one
    of billions that are able to go through interstellar space.

    of trans-dimensional or other dimensions and the technologies and the sciences dealing with this subject are what we have
    termed trans-dimensional interstellar, TDIs and this refers to very advanced sciences and technologies where there is
    a nexus between electromagnetism in the magnetic field, gravitational forces in three-dimensional space and time and what
    Dr. Jahn at Princeton in the engineering lab began to prove is the science of consciousness which was actually an issue
    that I did talk a fair amount with Lawrence Rockefeller about.

    because the speed of light is too slow.

    and she said what I want to know is how are these civilizations communicating across the vastness of space because your
    cell phone and radio waves are going at the speed of light and I said yes that's just too slow, speed of light is way
    too slow.

    across vast distances instantly and this has been done with particles but we're talking about civilizations that can do
    it with entire spacecraft and occupants, you're dealing with an entirely new physics but their communication devices and
    their own innate abilities allow for thought actuated events and I know Dr. Wood may mention this and that he discovered
    when he was doing some work for Old Mac McDonald and McDonald Douglas that he looked into some cases where in some meetings
    with these ETs involved a little box and there was a direct thought communication but it was also being facilitated through
    electronics and this is something that we call technology assisted consciousness and thought and this is a very specific
    area

    that in terms of just bringing this issue around there are so many aspects of it that are very exciting from the point
    of view of science, technology and understanding the universe and ourselves and also who are we and where did we come
    from and how is it that we exist in this cosmos and I agree with Edgar Mitchell on this that is a conscious quantum hologram
    that is awake and that we are all part of and that mind itself is the ultimate final frontier not space but consciousness
    in mind.

    also but one of the things that I found when I was working with these folks is that there's a saying in American business
    everyone wants to be first to be second and so in this case there's so many people who have had an interest of this but
    they want to hold back and not speak the whole truth about it but I think we need to be able to liberate ourselves to
    speak the truth and it involves many, many complex issues part of which has been touched on in the last 15 or 20 minutes.
