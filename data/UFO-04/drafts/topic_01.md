→ {"text": "這裡剛才有人討論對軍方進行審計的問題，因為我在這方面投入了大量時間，基本上我的看法很簡單：軍方握有權力，國會沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. That's basically the rule around the world.
→ {"text": "這基本上是全世界的規則。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. It comes down to military technology, and I think a lot of the governments of the world are basically playing the same game that they're trying to protect the military stuff and release the core story or release the siting files.
→ {"text": "歸根結底是軍事技術的問題，我認為世界上許多政府基本上都在玩同樣的遊戲——試圖保護軍事機密，同時釋出核心故事或目擊檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. The little short statement, I'll try to keep it short, what I wanted to read was the fact that even though we're looking at a lot of secrecy, there was people inside the Clinton administration who actually did try to get this material out.
→ {"text": "接下來這段簡短陳述，我會盡量保持簡短。我想說的是，儘管我們看到大量的保密措施，但柯林頓政府內部確實有人試圖讓這些資料曝光。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. They believed there was a live alien.
→ {"text": "他們相信那裡有活的外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. They believed there was a craft underground, and then Bill Clinton actually went there to try to get to the bottom of this thing, and he stated in 2005, after mentioning this, he said, "I'm probably not the first president they kept in the dark or that bureaucrats have tried to wait out."
→ {"text": "他們相信地下有飛行器。Bill Clinton 實際上曾前往那裡試圖查明真相，他在 2005 年提到此事後表示:「我可能不是第一個被他們蒙在鼓裡的總統，也不是官僚們第一個試圖拖延等待的對象。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. So Clinton tried to get to these materials.
→ {"text": "所以 Clinton 試圖取得這些資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. He told Paul Davids that he was fascinated with the subject of UFOs, and he was very interested in the latest Roswell book that had come out that was given to him at that time, and Bill Clinton had actually, as we look back in the files, Bill Clinton had actually given a job to Webster Hubbell.
→ {"text": "他告訴 Paul Davids，他對不明飛行物這個主題深感著迷，並且對當時送給他的最新羅斯威爾事件書籍非常感興趣。回顧檔案，Bill Clinton 實際上曾指派 Webster Hubbell 執行一項任務。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. Number one, are there UFOs, and number two, who killed JFK?"
→ {"text": "第一，是否有不明飛行物？第二，誰殺了甘迺迪？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. So Bill Clinton was a guy who didn't believe the official stories of the UFO or of the JFK stuff, and he actually sent someone to try to get the answers to this material.
→ {"text": "所以 Bill Clinton 是一個不相信不明飛行物或甘迺迪事件官方說法的人，他實際上派人去試圖取得這些問題的答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. One of Bill Clinton's main, this is sort of being overlooked here, one of Bill Clinton's main allies in this effort to try to get material, it was John Podesta, and he and John Podesta actually did try to get a lot of classified material out into the public.
→ {"text": "Bill Clinton 在試圖取得資料的努力中，有一位主要盟友——這點常被忽略——那就是 John Podesta。他與 John Podesta 確實試圖將大量機密資料公諸於世。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "「兩個世紀以來，美國之所以繁榮昌盛，是因為我們在最佳狀態時，找到了兼顧兩者的方法。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. So to achieve this, they signed the Executive Order which said that anything that was over 25 years old had to be declassified except in extreme circumstances.
→ {"text": "因此為了達成這個目標，他們簽署了這項行政命令，規定任何超過 25 年的文件都必須解密，除非情況極為特殊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "實際結果是，1995 年至 2000 年間，柯林頓政府解密了 8 億頁文件，相較於前 15 年的 1.88 億頁。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. Unfortunately, the sought-after UFO documents that the Clintons wanted released with this material never materialized.
→ {"text": "不幸的是，柯林頓夫婦希望隨這些資料釋出的不明飛行物文件從未出現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. And then in 2002, Podesta who went on to work for the Obama administration stated in a public statement at a sci-fi conference, "I think it's time to open the books on the questions that have remained in the dark, on the questions of government investigations of UFOs.
→ {"text": "2002 年，Podesta 轉往歐巴馬政府任職後，在一場科幻大會上發表公開聲明：「我認為是時候公開那些一直被蒙在暗處的問題、政府對不明飛行物調查的問題了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. We ought to do it because it's right.

→ {"text": "我們應該這麼做，因為美國人民能夠承受真相，而且我們應該這麼做，因為這是法律規定。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. Another ally in getting openness regarding UFOs inside the Clinton administration was the Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson who has made many pro-UFO disclosure messages over the years.
→ {"text": "柯林頓政府內部另一位爭取不明飛行物開放性的盟友是能源部長 Bill Richardson，他多年來發表過許多支持真相揭露的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. For example, writing an a foreword to the book on the Roswell UFO crash when he was governor of New Mexico, Richardson wrote, "Clearly, it would help everybody if the U.S. government disclosed everything it knows.

73. I've been in the cabinet.
