## Speaker Group 12

12. All right, Mr. Cameron.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

13. Okay, I had prepared a first statement, but I have a little bit of comment and a short second statement that I wanted to sort of add as part two.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. There was some discussion here about doing an audit on the military, and because I've spent a lot of time on this, basically the way I see it, it's very simple, the military has the power, Congress doesn't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. It'd be the same as the war between the President and Congress who has power.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. They have the power right now, and I think you have to take it back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. They're not going to give it to you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. They're not going to surrender and allow you to audit them, because they're running the show, and that's the way they want it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. A second comment I'd like to make is regarding the same sort of issue about military, because I was involved in the Area 51 story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. I knew George Knapp, who was the chief investigative reporter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. He told the story about the Appropriations Committee in Congress had wanted, when they heard the story about the flying saucers at Area 51 and the Aurora and all sorts of planes that were flying around Area 51 that the Appropriations Committee were going like, "What is going on here?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. We haven't heard about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. Did we put money up for this?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. They sent Dick D'Amato, who was a congressional investigator, to Area 51 to get inside Area 51.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. He had all the top security clearances.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. He had everything that you needed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. He could give people immunity, and he went in there, and he tried to talk to this one witness that I mentioned to you in the previous panel, this Alfred O'Donnell fellow who refused to talk, and he came back, and Stephen Greer can confirm this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. He talked to a number of researchers, and he told Stephen Greer, "I just want to let you know you're up against the varsity team of all black budget programs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. Good luck."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. And he said with top security clearance, with Appropriations Committee behind him, he could not get anywhere, that this thing is so deeply held.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. And that's basically what Ben Rich said as well, is that it would take an act of God to get this thing out of Congress, because it's so deep black.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. Even though they have the technology, nobody's ever going to see it as far as the military is concerned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. And I would also comment on the foreign government thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. I have a little bit of a disagreement with most people, because I am from Canada, and the idea is that the rest of the world is disclosing material.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. I'd say they are not disclosing material.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. They are releasing their siting files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. Siting files is what the U.S. government released with Blue Book in 1969.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. Siting reports are just garbage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. They're just stuff that's there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. What you want to see is you want to see the top secret material, the interaction between government and military, and it still comes down, if you look at Britain, for example, Britain now, the story is they're bringing out their files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. They're just dumping their files so they can get out of the UFO business.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. Margaret Thatcher said, when she was asked in 1997, you must make sure you get the facts correct and you can't tell the people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. That's basically the rule around the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. It comes down to military technology, and I think a lot of the governments of the world are basically playing the same game that they're trying to protect the military stuff and release the core story or release the siting files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. The little short statement, I'll try to keep it short, what I wanted to read was the fact that even though we're looking at a lot of secrecy, there was people inside the Clinton administration who actually did try to get this material out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. They were trying to shake this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. Bill Clinton, for example, had done some work with John Podesta, and he actually, in 2005 in Hong Kong, Bill Clinton actually was talking about this in public, and he stated that the vast majority of the people in the Clinton administration believed the story of Area 51.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. They believed there was a live alien.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. They believed there was a craft underground, and then Bill Clinton actually went there to try to get to the bottom of this thing, and he stated in 2005, after mentioning this, he said, "I'm probably not the first president they kept in the dark or that bureaucrats have tried to wait out."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. So Clinton tried to get to these materials.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. He told Paul Davids that he was fascinated with the subject of UFOs, and he was very interested in the latest Roswell book that had come out that was given to him at that time, and Bill Clinton had actually, as we look back in the files, Bill Clinton had actually given a job to Webster Hubbell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. The job he said to Webster, according to Webster Hubbell's book, Friends in High Places in 1997, Hubbell said that Bill told him, "If I put you over there in justice, I want you to find out the answer to two questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. Number one, are there UFOs, and number two, who killed JFK?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. So Bill Clinton was a guy who didn't believe the official stories of the UFO or of the JFK stuff, and he actually sent someone to try to get the answers to this material.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. One of Bill Clinton's main, this is sort of being overlooked here, one of Bill Clinton's main allies in this effort to try to get material, it was John Podesta, and he and John Podesta actually did try to get a lot of classified material out into the public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. It was the Executive Order 12958, which was signed in 1995, and it introduced a 25-year rule which hoped to bring to light many hidden secrets inside government like the UFO issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. What was sought was a proper balance of openness in government versus what Podesta called unthinking secrecy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. Podesta stated, "Our founders knew that democracy cannot function in the absence of public information."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. He noted the importance of balancing the vital interests of national security with the genuine claims of public openness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. "For two centuries, we have prospered and won in the United States because at our best, we have found a way to do both."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. So to achieve this, they signed the Executive Order which said that anything that was over 25 years old had to be declassified except in extreme circumstances.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. What basically happened was that between 1995 and 2000, the Clinton administration was able to declassify 800 million pages of documents compared to 188 million pages in the previous 15 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. Unfortunately, the sought-after UFO documents that the Clintons wanted released with this material never materialized.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. And then in 2002, Podesta who went on to work for the Obama administration stated in a public statement at a sci-fi conference, "I think it's time to open the books on the questions that have remained in the dark, on the questions of government investigations of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. We ought to do it because it's right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. We ought to do it because the American people can handle the truth, and we ought to do it because it's the law."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. Another ally in getting openness regarding UFOs inside the Clinton administration was the Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson who has made many pro-UFO disclosure messages over the years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. For example, writing an a foreword to the book on the Roswell UFO crash when he was governor of New Mexico, Richardson wrote, "Clearly, it would help everybody if the U.S. government disclosed everything it knows.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. The American people can handle the truth no matter how bizarre or mundane.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. With full disclosure and our best scientific investigation, we should be able to find out what happened on that fateful day in 1947."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. Then in a question and answer while he was running for president, Richardson talked about his long history of attempts to get answers on UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. "I've been in government a long time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. I've been in the cabinet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. I've been in Congress, and I've always felt that the government doesn't tell the truth as much as it should on a lot of issues.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. When I was in Congress, I said to the Department of Defense, "What's the data?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. What is the data you have?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. I was told the records were classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. That ticked me off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. So I just want to put on the record that there are some people inside government who are actually trying to get the material out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. [ Applause ]
