## Speaker Group 19

152. Okay. Mr. Bartlett.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

153. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. Appreciate your testimony very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. We have a free press, so-called free press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

156. Theoretically, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. There are advantages and disadvantages of a free press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. They reported the Boston bombing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. There will very likely be copycat things because that was reported.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. Where the press is controlled that would not be reported, so there would be no copycat.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. So there are some disadvantages to a free press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. Where is the press in all of this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. If in fact there is a story to be told here, why isn't the press telling that story?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. If there is a cover-up, do they not seem to be complicit in that cover-up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

165. Yes. Well, can I comment on that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

166. By control from above.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

167. I think this is a really central issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. And I actually, over my 22 years of being deeply involved with this at various levels, I have concluded that the secrecy is very much involving the fact that on certain issues we do not have a free press anymore than we have a free market economy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. And I think that this is a serious problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. And I have a document that will be in the materials that I'm providing for the committee that is a 1991 CIA document where it talks about the fact that they have folks at all the major media outlets, wire services, news magazines, television networks to change, alter, or delay and stop stories that they would like to see stopped.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. Now this was released briefly and then reclassified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. It was under the first President Bush term.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. And this is not a contested CIA document.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. What that means is that on certain issues this will be absolutely, there will be an intervention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. And we saw this happen with the 2001 event at this national press club disclosure launch 12 years ago, almost today, on May 9th of 2001.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. And one of the people I dealt with, Bob Schwartz, who was on the board of Time Life that later became AOL, Time Warner, and CNN, the whole conglomerate, he told me that he was very good friends with Mike Wallace.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. And he had given him a lot of these documents that we had.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. And Mike Wallace wanted to do the story at 60 Minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. And the corporate CBS, and I think at the time it was controlled by Westinghouse, a big defense contractor, did not permit him to do the story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. Ira Rosen, who was at ABC News executive producer for 2020 and Primetime Live, he came to my home in Virginia out near Thomas Jefferson's home, ironically.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. And I gave him 35 digital hours of top secret witness testimony and many documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. And he said, "This, if true, is the biggest story ever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. I want to do this story."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. I said, "Well, I'll cooperate fully."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. He had gotten his Emmy working with Mike Wallace at 60 Minutes where he has returned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. And I said, "I don't think you'll be allowed to do this story."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. And Ira Rosen said, "Oh, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. I'm the executive producer of these shows.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. I can do it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. And I said, "Okay." Well, two weeks later, he called me up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. And he said, "Dr. Greer, they won't let me do this story."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. I said, "Ira, who are they?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. And he said, "Dr. Greer, you know who they are."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. Now, I could tell you probably 100 stories like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. And this becomes very worrisome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. Here we are in the National Press Club.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. And we have a lot of enormously important information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. And, you know, in the New York Times, if you have three confirmed sources for a controversial story, they can run with it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. Here, the Disclosure Project, which I founded some years ago, it was first Project Starlight when I began to work with Lawrence Rockefeller.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. We now have over 500.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. Many of them, I have the names of them and they can be subpoenaed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. Some of them, about 100 of them, we have on digital videotape.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. Why isn't this a story?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. And I think that this becomes a very important question in a democracy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. You know, if you have the larger media not covering something that 50, 60 percent of the public believe is true, and there's an enormous amount of data, 4,000 landing cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. The COMETA Report, where they documented the landing in Provence of a craft, the Bentwaters case, where a craft landed at RAF Bentwaters and left physical trace that has been confirmed by the Ministry of Defense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. We have all this hard data and information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. We have radar traces of these objects moving.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. We have pilot cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. We have over 3,500 pilot reports in our archives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. This isn't a story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. How can that be?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. Now, there's another reason, the ha-ha factor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. I have met with so many senior people in government who say, "I am so interested in this, but don't let anyone know that I'm interested."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. And the reason for it, I think, you know, you could be gay and have five wives and do whatever, I mean, you could do anything and be out of the closet on it, and it would be no problem, but this subject, whoa, watch out, because your career is on the line, as mine was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. Okay. Now, I think that what you find is that the social opprobrium, the appropriate term, attached to this issue was launched in 1953.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. We have a CIA document that describes their attempts to debunk and ridicule the subject, but also, very important, to engage Disney studios to make cartoons and movies about it that would marginalize the subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. This is a CIA document, little green men, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. So that has worked, and there's an Air Force major, George Filer, who I know, he may be here, who said, "Look, the secrecy really has been created mainly through the force of just ridicule.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. People don't want to be made a laughing stock."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. And I think that fear of ridicule by one's peerage, whether you're a senator or a doctor or a university professor, is a very hard thing to overcome once the counterintelligence people have done their business, and they have on this, and it is propaganda.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. There is very serious information in intelligence, and I think that we have to figure out how do we get around the truth embargo, as Steve calls it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. In reality, we're sort of in, it's not just the government doing the embargo, it's we are doing the embargo because we have been brainwashed to laugh at this issue instead of look at it in a very serious, scientific, in-depth, and honest and truthful way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. [ Applause ]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

225. So time keep, how much more time does Mr. Bartlett have?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

226. Three minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

227. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. I would think that the main reason the press is not covering is a ridicule thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. We've been watching the tweets and what's going on today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. They're not all positive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. They're not as negative as we thought they might be, but they're not all positive tweets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

232. Can I make a comment on this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

233. I wanted to turn for just a moment, go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

234. Yeah, I just want to comment on this because I've had some involvement with this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. As I mentioned in my statement, Bill Clinton asked Webster Hubbell to go and get the answer to who killed JFK, and if you go to the files that have been recovered, there's like 5,000, almost 6,000 pages of Kennedy assassination stuff that the Clintons did uncover, and he asked them to uncover JFK and UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. When that book was released, "Friends in High Places" by Hubbell in 1997, that, of course, the very next day in the White House press briefing, his question was brought up, and it was Deborah Oren, who was no friend of the Clintons from "New York Post" who asked the question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. She asked the president's press secretary, "Can you tell me did Webster Hubbell get the job to go out and look at UFOs?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. And he walked around the question the first time, and Deborah Oren in an interview said she came back with a follow-up question, and she said, "I'd like to know is what Mr. Hubbell writes in his book true?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. And the press secretary for the president said, "I'm not going to comment what people write in their personal books."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. And Deborah Oren said in an interview later, she said, "I sat there and waited for someone to follow up on this very important question, and the rest of the White House press corps rolled over and played dead."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. And basically what it comes down to is if you worked your way up to the White House, you don't want to be the one that asked the stupid UFO question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. You want to ask something very smart because you may end up losing your job.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. You worked your way up there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. So a lot of it does have to do with the ridicule, and a lot of it has to do with I mentioned Chase Brandon who was this 42-year CIA guy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. He writes a fictional book about Roswell, and there was one of the stories that we'd always tried to track in the UFO world, and that was by Richard Helms.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. It was a statement where Richard Helms says, "We control all the media of any consequence in America."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. And we were trying to track this, and if you look in Chase Brandon's book, his character in the book actually uses this statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. Richard Helms said, "We control all media of any consequence in America," and the character says, "I wish he hadn't said that."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

249. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. I go back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

251. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. Senator Gravel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
