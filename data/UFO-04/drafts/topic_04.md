## Speaker Group 24

167. I think this is a really central issue.
→ {"text": "我認為這是一個非常核心的議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. And I actually, over my 22 years of being deeply involved with this at various levels, I have concluded that the secrecy is very much involving the fact that on certain issues we do not have a free press anymore than we have a free market economy.
→ {"text": "事實上，在我深度參與這個議題的 22 年間，在各個層面上，我得出的結論是，這種保密制度很大程度上涉及一個事實：在某些議題上，我們既沒有自由新聞界，也沒有自由市場經濟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. And I think that this is a serious problem.
→ {"text": "我認為這是一個嚴重的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. And I have a document that will be in the materials that I'm providing for the committee that is a 1991 CIA document where it talks about the fact that they have folks at all the major media outlets, wire services, news magazines, television networks to change, alter, or delay and stop stories that they would like to see stopped.
→ {"text": "我有一份文件，將納入我提供給委員會的材料中，那是一份 1991 年的 CIA 文件，文件中談到他們在所有主要媒體機構、通訊社、新聞雜誌、電視網路都安插了人員，以改變、修改、延遲或阻止他們希望被阻止的報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. And this is not a contested CIA document.

174. What that means is that on certain issues this will be absolutely, there will be an intervention.
→ {"text": "這意味著在某些議題上，絕對會有干預介入。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. And we saw this happen with the 2001 event at this national press club disclosure launch 12 years ago, almost today, on May 9th of 2001.
→ {"text": "我們在 12 年前，也就是幾乎就是今天，2001 年 5 月 9 日在國家新聞俱樂部舉辦的揭露計畫記者會上目睹了這種情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我接觸過的一位人士，Bob Schwartz，他是 Time Life 董事會成員，後來該公司成為 AOL、Time Warner 和 CNN 整個企業集團的一部分，他告訴我他與麥克·華萊士是非常好的朋友。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

178. And Mike Wallace wanted to do the story at 60 Minutes.
→ {"text": "麥克·華萊士想在《60分鐘》上報導這個故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. And the corporate CBS, and I think at the time it was controlled by Westinghouse, a big defense contractor, did not permit him to do the story.
→ {"text": "但 CBS 企業層，我認為當時是由西屋電氣公司控制，一家大型國防承包商，不允許他報導這個故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. Ira Rosen, who was at ABC News executive producer for 2020 and Primetime Live, he came to my home in Virginia out near Thomas Jefferson's home, ironically.
→ {"text": "艾拉·羅森，他是 ABC 新聞《20/20》和《黃金時間現場》的執行製作人，諷刺的是，他來到我位於維吉尼亞州的家，就在 Thomas Jefferson 故居附近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. I said, "Ira, who are they?"

193. And he said, "Dr. Greer, you know who they are."

194. Now, I could tell you probably 100 stories like that.

195. And this becomes very worrisome.
→ {"text": "這變得非常令人擔憂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. And we have a lot of enormously important information.

→ {"text": "你知道，在《紐約時報》，如果你對一個有爭議的故事有三個已確認的消息來源，他們就可以刊登。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "在這裡，揭露計畫，是我幾年前創立的，當我開始與勞倫斯·洛克菲勒合作時，最初叫星光計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. You know, if you have the larger media not covering something that 50, 60 percent of the public believe is true, and there's an enormous amount of data, 4,000 landing cases.
→ {"text": "你知道，如果主流媒體不報導某件事，而有 50、60% 的公眾相信這是真的，並且有大量的數據，4，000 個降落案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. This isn't a story.
→ {"text": "這不是一個新聞故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. How can that be?
→ {"text": "怎麼可能？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. Now, there's another reason, the ha-ha factor.
→ {"text": "現在，還有另一個原因，嘲笑因素。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. I have met with so many senior people in government who say, "I am so interested in this, but don't let anyone know that I'm interested."
→ {"text": "我見過許多政府高層人士，他們說：「我對此非常感興趣，但不要讓任何人知道我感興趣。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. And the reason for it, I think, you know, you could be gay and have five wives and do whatever, I mean, you could do anything and be out of the closet on it, and it would be no problem, but this subject, whoa, watch out, because your career is on the line, as mine was.
→ {"text": "我認為，原因是這樣的，你知道，你可以是同性戀，有五個妻子，做任何事，我的意思是，你可以做任何事並公開出櫃，都不會有問題，但這個主題，哇，要小心，因為你的職業生涯岌岌可危，就像我的一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. Okay. Now, I think that what you find is that the social opprobrium, the appropriate term, attached to this issue was launched in 1953.
→ {"text": "好的，現在，我認為你會發現，附加在這個議題上的社會譴責，這是恰當的術語，是在 1953 年發起的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. We have a CIA document that describes their attempts to debunk and ridicule the subject, but also, very important, to engage Disney studios to make cartoons and movies about it that would marginalize the subject.
→ {"text": "我們有一份 CIA 文件，描述了他們試圖揭穿和嘲笑這個主題的努力，而且非常重要的是，他們還聯合迪士尼片廠製作關於此主題的卡通和電影，以邊緣化這個主題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. This is a CIA document, little green men, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
→ {"text": "這是一份 CIA 文件，小綠人，哈哈哈哈哈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. So that has worked, and there's an Air Force major, George Filer, who I know, he may be here, who said, "Look, the secrecy really has been created mainly through the force of just ridicule.
→ {"text": "所以這招奏效了，有一位空軍少校，George Filer，我認識他，他可能在這裡，他說：「聽著，保密制度真正主要是透過嘲笑的力量建立起來的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. People don't want to be made a laughing stock."
→ {"text": "人們不想成為笑柄。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. And I think that fear of ridicule by one's peerage, whether you're a senator or a doctor or a university professor, is a very hard thing to overcome once the counterintelligence people have done their business, and they have on this, and it is propaganda.
→ {"text": "我認為，一旦反情報人員完成了他們的工作，對被同儕嘲笑的恐懼是很難克服的，無論你是參議員、醫生還是大學教授，而他們在這方面已經完成了，這就是宣傳。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. There is very serious information in intelligence, and I think that we have to figure out how do we get around the truth embargo, as Steve calls it.
→ {"text": "情報界有非常嚴肅的資訊，我認為我們必須弄清楚如何繞過真相封鎖，正如 Steve 所稱呼的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. In reality, we're sort of in, it's not just the government doing the embargo, it's we are doing the embargo because we have been brainwashed to laugh at this issue instead of look at it in a very serious, scientific, in-depth, and honest and truthful way.
→ {"text": "事實上，我們某種程度上處於這樣的狀態，不僅僅是政府在實施封鎖，而是我們自己在實施封鎖，因為我們被洗腦去嘲笑這個議題，而不是以非常嚴肅、科學、深入、誠實和真實的方式來看待它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. [ Applause ]
→ {"text": "［掌聲］", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

225. So time keep, how much more time does Mr. Bartlett have?

→ {"text": "三分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

227. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. I would think that the main reason the press is not covering is a ridicule thing.
→ {"text": "我認為新聞界不報導的主要原因是嘲笑問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. We've been watching the tweets and what's going on today.
→ {"text": "我們一直在關注今天的推文和正在發生的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. They're not all positive.
→ {"text": "它們並非全部是正面的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. They're not as negative as we thought they might be, but they're not all positive tweets.
→ {"text": "它們並不像我們想像的那樣負面，但也不是全部都是正面的推文。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

232. Can I make a comment on this?
→ {"text": "我可以對此發表意見嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

233. I wanted to turn for just a moment, go ahead.
→ {"text": "我想轉個話題，請繼續。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

234. Yeah, I just want to comment on this because I've had some involvement with this.
→ {"text": "是的，我只是想對此發表意見，因為我對此有一些參與。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. As I mentioned in my statement, Bill Clinton asked Webster Hubbell to go and get the answer to who killed JFK, and if you go to the files that have been recovered, there's like 5,000, almost 6,000 pages of Kennedy assassination stuff that the Clintons did uncover, and he asked them to uncover JFK and UFOs.
→ {"text": "正如我在陳述中提到的，Bill Clinton 要求韋伯斯特·哈貝爾去找出誰殺了甘迺迪的答案，如果你去查看已經找回的檔案，有大約 5，000 頁，幾乎 6，000 頁關於甘迺迪暗殺的資料是柯林頓夫婦確實挖掘出來的，而他要求他們調查甘迺迪和 UFO。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. When that book was released, "Friends in High Places" by Hubbell in 1997, that, of course, the very next day in the White House press briefing, his question was brought up, and it was Deborah Oren, who was no friend of the Clintons from "New York Post" who asked the question.
→ {"text": "當哈貝爾的那本書《高層友人》在 1997 年發行時，當然，第二天在白宮記者會上，他的問題被提出來了，提問的是《紐約郵報》的黛博拉·奧倫，她並非柯林頓夫婦的朋友。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. She asked the president's press secretary, "Can you tell me did Webster Hubbell get the job to go out and look at UFOs?"
→ {"text": "她問總統新聞秘書：「你能告訴我韋伯斯特·哈貝爾是否接到了去調查 UFO 的任務？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. And he walked around the question the first time, and Deborah Oren in an interview said she came back with a follow-up question, and she said, "I'd like to know is what Mr. Hubbell writes in his book true?"
→ {"text": "他第一次迴避了這個問題，黛博拉·奧倫在一次訪談中說她提出了一個後續問題，她說：「我想知道哈貝爾先生在他書中所寫的是否屬實？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. And the press secretary for the president said, "I'm not going to comment what people write in their personal books."
→ {"text": "總統新聞秘書說：「我不會評論人們在他們個人書籍中寫的內容。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. And Deborah Oren said in an interview later, she said, "I sat there and waited for someone to follow up on this very important question, and the rest of the White House press corps rolled over and played dead."
→ {"text": "黛博拉·奧倫在後來的訪談中說：「我坐在那裡等待有人追問這個非常重要的問題，但白宮記者團的其他人卻翻身裝死。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. And basically what it comes down to is if you worked your way up to the White House, you don't want to be the one that asked the stupid UFO question.
→ {"text": "基本上，歸根結底就是，如果你努力工作才進入白宮記者團，你不想成為那個提出愚蠢 UFO 問題的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. You want to ask something very smart because you may end up losing your job.
→ {"text": "你想問一些非常聰明的問題，因為你可能最終會失去工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. You worked your way up there.
→ {"text": "你是一路努力爬上去的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. So a lot of it does have to do with the ridicule, and a lot of it has to do with I mentioned Chase Brandon who was this 42-year CIA guy.
→ {"text": "所以很大一部分確實與嘲笑有關，而且很大一部分與我提到的 Chase Brandon 有關，他是一位在 CIA 工作了 42 年的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. He writes a fictional book about Roswell, and there was one of the stories that we'd always tried to track in the UFO world, and that was by Richard Helms.
→ {"text": "他寫了一本關於羅斯威爾事件的虛構小說，在 UFO 世界裡我們一直試圖追查的一個故事，那就是理查德·赫爾姆斯的說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. It was a statement where Richard Helms says, "We control all the media of any consequence in America."
→ {"text": "那是一個聲明，理查德·赫爾姆斯說：「我們控制了美國所有重要的媒體。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. And we were trying to track this, and if you look in Chase Brandon's book, his character in the book actually uses this statement.
→ {"text": "我們一直試圖追查這個說法，如果你查看 Chase Brandon 的書，他書中的角色實際上使用了這個聲明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. Richard Helms said, "We control all media of any consequence in America," and the character says, "I wish he hadn't said that."
→ {"text": "理查德·赫爾姆斯說：「我們控制了美國所有重要的媒體」，而書中的角色說：「我希望他沒說過那句話。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

250. I go back.
