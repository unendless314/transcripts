82. I was invited by Mr. Rockefeller to the Wyoming Ranch along with some of the people here, Stephen Greer was there, others.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. And what links in my mind was a discussion that I had with then John Mack, MD, psychiatrist from Harvard University who had taken a great interest in the abduction syndrome both as a psychiatrist and then as somebody who was trying to understand as I and others were.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. What is the true nature of an advanced intelligence that would be interacting with this planet and may not itself, the prime intelligence, be the actor here, but making various kinds of cloned entities that would interact on this particular planet in this particular atmosphere, this particular gravity and this particular solar system?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. And Dr. Mack and I at Mr. Rockefeller's place in Wyoming were discussing this and we went into the issue of why is it that the non-human intelligence as described in the human abduction syndrome appears to be 100% telepathic with the ability to both place impressions in human minds and to also project three dimensional holograms that the human mind and I cannot distinguish from the world around us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. This is something that he, I and many others had encountered and the more deeper you get into this field the more you realize that our reality can be manipulated through our minds without us being able to tell the difference at times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. And this led to a discussion which at the time I had only shared with Dr. Mack, God rest him wherever he is now, that very year I had a face to face with a man who was currently working in the United States military who had been aware of my work and by that '92, '93 time period I had produced the book in Alien Harvest as well as TV productions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. And in the whole question of why would something advanced from someplace else in the universe be mutilating animals on this planet, this man was trying to tell me that there is a survival issue as well as a cloning issue in what we are dealing with and that genetic material has been harvested from this planet for a long time to create containers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. And this in discussion with Dr. Mack led to, I thought I would share this today to show you if this is true what I'm going to share with you, it shows how difficult it is for all humans to relate to any aspect of all of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. The military person was describing his first hand experience that occurred in 1978 in a small town in Northern Arizona.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. He worked for a unit that would be comparable to what has been in some of the government documents called Moon Dust or Project Pounce.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. These are units that were put together at least as far back as right after Roswell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. Units that would be trained to go to wherever there was a reported crash or landing because some of these craft have been clearly left or put down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. And that their job would be to extract technology, the craft and the bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. And that he was on one of those teams.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. And he told me that in 1978 in this town in Northern Arizona there was a flood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. And that our military unit understood that the flood was not caused by nature and it was not caused by humans, it was caused by something that was in the category of what they called non-human.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. And that he was assigned to a group to go there to try to understand why had the water been released from a dam into this town by something non-human.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. And that his superior officer said we are going to communicate with and bring in one of the Eben's.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. And I want you to have the experience of what a telepathic download upload is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. And he said they described exactly what would happen, that his superior officers would be nearby, they had done this before, it was a test.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. And that he was to stand in a particular position and that this non-human entity would be asked to stay on the ground because apparently they have the ability to neutralize gravity even in a focused way as an individual body that they would prefer not to walk on the ground.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. And that one of the conditions would be that the entity would approach him with his full knowledge and that they wanted him to have the experience of the telepathic communication.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. And I was telling Dr. Mack at Mr. Rockefeller's facility in Wyoming that he told me very honestly, he said you know I was so full of myself as a young man that when they were trying to warn me that I would not be prepared for what happened, I thought nonsense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. But he said it's my superior officer and he said I want you to know that there will be a point where you are going to want to run or collapse and I'm ordering you to stand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. And he said I thought it was so silly and then everything started to unfold and the being came about four feet high, he was six foot four, he remembered how much taller he was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. They had told him the being would come up to about three to four feet from him but be very low and they told him all controlled, that the being would simply raise its head and when the eyes connected with his eyes, he would no longer be in control of his mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. He thought all of it was nonsense and then the being's head started to rise and he said Linda imagine having seven feature films with sound, with touch, with heat, with every sensation that we know and more and over all of the seven films running in your mind are gold three-dimensional symbols.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. And he said I remember that my knees began to shake and buckled and I knew that I was fainting and men caught him and he said they put me on a cot and they left me there for three hours and when I woke up, if God himself had asked me what had been communicated in those seven films, I would not know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. He said my superior officer told me later every human thinking about extraterrestrial biological entities and the whole issue of us not being alone in the universe and the wonder of being able to travel the universe and to communicate with non-humans, we would like to do it over coffee and he said it isn't going to happen because what happens when their minds telepathically download to our minds, they are uploading every single thing we've ever experienced or thought from our minds and that the end result often is information is added by the non-humans into the human mind that has had this experience but then we live on a planet where our fellow humans cannot even hear what uploaded downloaded information
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. from non-humans might be because we have taken the position as odd as it is that we are alone in the universe and this does not exist and Dr. Mack, after I told him that story, he looked at me and he said, you know Linda, I agree I think we are dealing with extraterrestrial biological entities in some cases but he said, you know, I think that it's too complex that it must involve time travelers, other dimensions and that we are truly like little infants approaching something that is beyond our understanding and I will just close exactly on that note with another man who died not long after I was able to talk with him somewhere like around 1992.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. He also served in the military high ranking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. Some people had sought me out because he wanted to ask me a question about some of my work and I will never forget he said, Linda this is all so strange and it has been so strange to all of us that have been exposed to it for so long that not any of us ever want to take it home to our spouses, our children or anyone we know, not because it's threatening necessarily but because nobody knows how to have the discussion and today we are meeting at the National Press Club in Washington where there have been various revolutions before and it seems to me no matter how strange it is, if we don't get past this point of having our government built on 60 years of lies to protect us,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. the nation probably will implode and I think you know what I mean.
