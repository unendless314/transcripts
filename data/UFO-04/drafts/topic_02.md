82. I was invited by Mr. Rockefeller to the Wyoming Ranch along with some of the people here, Stephen Greer was there, others.
→ {"text": "我受洛克菲勒先生邀請前往懷俄明牧場，在場還有這裡的一些人，Stephen Greer 也在，還有其他人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. And what links in my mind was a discussion that I had with then John Mack, MD, psychiatrist from Harvard University who had taken a great interest in the abduction syndrome both as a psychiatrist and then as somebody who was trying to understand as I and others were.
→ {"text": "我腦海中浮現的是我與 John Mack 醫師的討論，他是哈佛大學的精神科醫師，無論作為精神科醫師還是像我和其他人一樣試圖理解這個現象的研究者，他都對綁架現象有極大的興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. What is the true nature of an advanced intelligence that would be interacting with this planet and may not itself, the prime intelligence, be the actor here, but making various kinds of cloned entities that would interact on this particular planet in this particular atmosphere, this particular gravity and this particular solar system?
→ {"text": "一個與這顆星球互動的先進智慧，其真實本質是什麼？這個原始智慧本身可能不是直接行動者，而是製造各種複製生命體，讓它們在這個特定星球、這個特定大氣層、這個特定重力與這個特定太陽系中互動？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. And Dr. Mack and I at Mr. Rockefeller's place in Wyoming were discussing this and we went into the issue of why is it that the non-human intelligence as described in the human abduction syndrome appears to be 100% telepathic with the ability to both place impressions in human minds and to also project three dimensional holograms that the human mind and I cannot distinguish from the world around us.
→ {"text": "Mack 醫師和我在洛克菲勒先生位於懷俄明的地方討論這個問題，我們深入探討了為什麼在人類綁架現象中描述的非人類智慧似乎百分之百具有心靈感應能力，既能在人類心智中植入印象，又能投射三維全息影像，讓人類心智無法分辨與周遭世界的差異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. This is something that he, I and many others had encountered and the more deeper you get into this field the more you realize that our reality can be manipulated through our minds without us being able to tell the difference at times.
→ {"text": "這是他、我以及許多其他人都遇到過的現象。你越深入這個領域，就越會意識到我們的現實可以透過我們的心智被操控，而我們有時無法分辨其中的差異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. And this led to a discussion which at the time I had only shared with Dr. Mack, God rest him wherever he is now, that very year I had a face to face with a man who was currently working in the United States military who had been aware of my work and by that '92, '93 time period I had produced the book in Alien Harvest as well as TV productions.
→ {"text": "這引發了一場討論，當時我只與 Mack 醫師分享過——願他安息。那一年我與一位當時在美國軍方任職的男子面對面交談，他知道我的工作。到了 1992、93 年那段時期，我已經出版了《異形收割》一書以及電視製作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. And in the whole question of why would something advanced from someplace else in the universe be mutilating animals on this planet, this man was trying to tell me that there is a survival issue as well as a cloning issue in what we are dealing with and that genetic material has been harvested from this planet for a long time to create containers.
→ {"text": "關於為什麼來自宇宙其他地方的先進存在會在這個星球上肢解動物這個問題，這位男子試圖告訴我，我們面對的是生存問題以及複製問題，而且基因材料已經從這個星球採集了很長時間，用來製造容器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. And this in discussion with Dr. Mack led to, I thought I would share this today to show you if this is true what I'm going to share with you, it shows how difficult it is for all humans to relate to any aspect of all of this.
→ {"text": "這個話題與 Mack 醫師的討論引出了——我今天想分享這件事，如果我即將分享的內容是真的，它顯示出所有人類要理解這一切的任何面向是多麼困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. The military person was describing his first hand experience that occurred in 1978 in a small town in Northern Arizona.
→ {"text": "這位軍方人士描述了他 1978 年在亞利桑那州北部一個小鎮的親身經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. He worked for a unit that would be comparable to what has been in some of the government documents called Moon Dust or Project Pounce.
→ {"text": "他任職的單位相當於某些政府文件中提到的月塵計畫或突襲計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. These are units that were put together at least as far back as right after Roswell.
→ {"text": "這些單位至少早在羅斯威爾事件之後就已經成立了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. Units that would be trained to go to wherever there was a reported crash or landing because some of these craft have been clearly left or put down.
→ {"text": "這些單位受過訓練，會前往任何有報告墜毀或降落的地點，因為有些飛行器明顯是被遺留或放下的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. And that their job would be to extract technology, the craft and the bodies.
→ {"text": "他們的工作是提取技術、飛行器以及屍體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. And that he was on one of those teams.
→ {"text": "他就是這些小組中的一員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. And he told me that in 1978 in this town in Northern Arizona there was a flood.
→ {"text": "他告訴我，1978 年在亞利桑那州北部這個小鎮發生了洪水。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. And that our military unit understood that the flood was not caused by nature and it was not caused by humans, it was caused by something that was in the category of what they called non-human.
→ {"text": "我們的軍事單位了解到這場洪水不是自然造成的，也不是人類造成的，而是由他們所稱的非人類類別的某種存在造成的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. And that he was assigned to a group to go there to try to understand why had the water been released from a dam into this town by something non-human.
→ {"text": "他被分配到一個小組，前往那裡試圖了解為什麼水會被某種非人類存在從水壩釋放到這個小鎮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. And that his superior officer said we are going to communicate with and bring in one of the Eben's.
→ {"text": "他的上級軍官說，我們將與一個外星生物實體溝通並將其帶來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. And I want you to have the experience of what a telepathic download upload is.
→ {"text": "「我希望你體驗一下什麼是心靈感應下載上傳。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. And he said they described exactly what would happen, that his superior officers would be nearby, they had done this before, it was a test.
→ {"text": "他說他們精確描述了將會發生的事情，他的上級軍官會在附近，他們以前做過這個，這是一次測試。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

102. And that he was to stand in a particular position and that this non-human entity would be asked to stay on the ground because apparently they have the ability to neutralize gravity even in a focused way as an individual body that they would prefer not to walk on the ground.
→ {"text": "他要站在特定位置，而這個非人類實體會被要求待在地面上，因為顯然它們具有中和重力的能力，甚至可以聚焦在個體身體上，所以它們寧願不在地面上行走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. And that one of the conditions would be that the entity would approach him with his full knowledge and that they wanted him to have the experience of the telepathic communication.
→ {"text": "條件之一是該實體會在他完全知情的情況下接近他，他們希望他體驗心靈感應溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. And I was telling Dr. Mack at Mr. Rockefeller's facility in Wyoming that he told me very honestly, he said you know I was so full of myself as a young man that when they were trying to warn me that I would not be prepared for what happened, I thought nonsense.
→ {"text": "我在洛克菲勒先生位於懷俄明的場所告訴 Mack 醫師，他非常誠實地告訴我，他說：「你知道，我年輕時非常自負，當他們試圖警告我，我不會對將要發生的事有所準備時，我認為那是胡說八道。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. But he said it's my superior officer and he said I want you to know that there will be a point where you are going to want to run or collapse and I'm ordering you to stand.
→ {"text": "「但他說這是我的上級軍官，他說：『我要你知道，會有一個時刻你會想逃跑或崩潰，而我命令你站著。』」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. And he said I thought it was so silly and then everything started to unfold and the being came about four feet high, he was six foot four, he remembered how much taller he was.
→ {"text": "他說：「我當時覺得這太荒謬了，然後一切開始展開，那個存有大約四英呎高，他身高六呎四吋，他記得自己高出多少。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

107. They had told him the being would come up to about three to four feet from him but be very low and they told him all controlled, that the being would simply raise its head and when the eyes connected with his eyes, he would no longer be in control of his mind.
→ {"text": "他們告訴他，這個存有會走到距離他約三到四英呎的地方，但會保持很低的姿勢。他們告訴他一切都在掌控中，這個存有只會抬起頭，當眼睛與他的眼睛接觸時，他將不再能控制自己的心智。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

108. He thought all of it was nonsense and then the being's head started to rise and he said Linda imagine having seven feature films with sound, with touch, with heat, with every sensation that we know and more and over all of the seven films running in your mind are gold three-dimensional symbols.
→ {"text": "他認為這一切都是胡說八道，然後那個存有的頭開始抬起。他說：「Linda，想像一下有七部劇情片，帶著聲音、觸感、熱度，以及我們所知的每一種感覺，甚至更多，而在你腦海中播放的這七部影片之上，還有金色的三維符號。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

109. And he said I remember that my knees began to shake and buckled and I knew that I was fainting and men caught him and he said they put me on a cot and they left me there for three hours and when I woke up, if God himself had asked me what had been communicated in those seven films, I would not know.
→ {"text": "他說：「我記得我的膝蓋開始顫抖並彎曲，我知道我要昏倒了。」有人接住了他，他說：「他們把我放在一張行軍床上，讓我在那裡躺了三個小時。當我醒來時，即使上帝親自問我那七部影片傳達了什麼，我也不會知道。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. He said my superior officer told me later every human thinking about extraterrestrial biological entities and the whole issue of us not being alone in the universe and the wonder of being able to travel the universe and to communicate with non-humans, we would like to do it over coffee and he said it isn't going to happen because what happens when their minds telepathically download to our minds, they are uploading every single thing we've ever experienced or thought from our minds and that the end result often is information is added by the non-humans into the human mind that has had this experience but then we live on a planet where our fellow humans cannot even hear what uploaded downloaded information
→ {"text": "他說，我的上級軍官後來告訴我：「每個人類在思考外星生物實體時，以及關於我們在宇宙中並不孤單這整個議題，以及能夠穿越宇宙旅行並與非人類溝通的奇妙可能性時，我們都希望能在喝咖啡時輕鬆討論。」但他說這不會發生，因為當它們的心智以心靈感應方式下載到我們的心智時，它們正在上傳我們曾經經歷或思考過的每一件事。而最終結果往往是，非人類將資訊加入到經歷過這種體驗的人類心智中，但我們生活在一個星球上，我們的人類同胞甚至無法聽到什麼是上傳下載的資訊——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. from non-humans might be because we have taken the position as odd as it is that we are alone in the universe and this does not exist and Dr. Mack, after I told him that story, he looked at me and he said, you know Linda, I agree I think we are dealing with extraterrestrial biological entities in some cases but he said, you know, I think that it's too complex that it must involve time travelers, other dimensions and that we are truly like little infants approaching something that is beyond our understanding and I will just close exactly on that note with another man who died not long after I was able to talk with him somewhere like around 1992.
→ {"text": "來自非人類的資訊可能是什麼，因為我們採取了一個奇怪的立場，認為我們在宇宙中是孤獨的，這些都不存在。Mack 醫師在我告訴他這個故事後，看著我說：「你知道 Linda，我同意，我認為我們在某些情況下確實在處理外星生物實體。但他說，你知道，我認為這太複雜了，必然涉及時間旅行者、其他維度，我們真的就像小嬰兒一樣，在接近某種超越我們理解的事物。」我將以另一位男士的話作為結束，他在 1992 年左右，我能夠與他交談後不久就去世了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

112. He also served in the military high ranking.
→ {"text": "他也曾在軍中擔任高階職位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. Some people had sought me out because he wanted to ask me a question about some of my work and I will never forget he said, Linda this is all so strange and it has been so strange to all of us that have been exposed to it for so long that not any of us ever want to take it home to our spouses, our children or anyone we know, not because it's threatening necessarily but because nobody knows how to have the discussion and today we are meeting at the National Press Club in Washington where there have been various revolutions before and it seems to me no matter how strange it is, if we don't get past this point of having our government built on 60 years of lies to protect us,
→ {"text": "有些人找到我，因為他想問我一些關於我工作的問題。我永遠不會忘記他說：「Linda，這一切都太奇怪了。對我們所有接觸這件事這麼久的人來說都太奇怪了，以至於我們沒有任何人想把它帶回家告訴我們的配偶、孩子或任何我們認識的人。不一定是因為它具有威脅性，而是因為沒有人知道如何進行這樣的討論。今天我們在華盛頓的國家新聞俱樂部開會，這裡以前曾發生過各種革命。在我看來，無論這有多奇怪，如果我們無法越過這個點——我們的政府建立在 60 年的謊言之上以保護我們——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. the nation probably will implode and I think you know what I mean.
→ {"text": "這個國家可能會內爆，我想你明白我的意思。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
