## Speaker Group 34

255. Well, I think, yeah, I think it's not just military.

256. I think it's a large macroeconomic and financial system.

258. However, as Jefferson said, the unchecked power of a corporation.

259. And see, if our budget is $3.8 trillion, but we're talking about something that if it's disclosed would threaten the privately owned interest in the oil, gas, coal, utility industries that are estimated in the multi-hundred trillions of dollars, what tail is wagging the dog of our democracy?
→ {"text": "你看，如果我們的預算是 3.8 兆美元，但我們討論的事情一旦揭露將威脅石油、天然氣、煤炭、公用事業產業的私有利益，這些產業估計價值數百兆美元，那麼是什麼尾巴在搖動我們民主的狗？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. And that's the big question.

286. Once upon a time, this country had horse and buggies.

→ {"text": "當你談到石油、天然氣和煤炭時，是的，那是金錢，這關乎金錢和權力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. But who's to say you can't transition that to what we're talking about here today with the kind of partnerships that we have to build in order to do that?
→ {"text": "但誰說你不能通過我們必須建立的那種夥伴關係，將其轉型到我們今天討論的內容？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. I'm sure I'll know more about this by the Friday.
→ {"text": "我相信到星期五我會對此了解更多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. But I think we have to look at it in terms of a comprehensive something that's related rather than separate from.

→ {"text": "我沒有錢，但我的意思是，那是我工作的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. That's where I work.
→ {"text": "那是我工作的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. But we can do this.
→ {"text": "但我們可以做到這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. I mean, we can do that with-- if we broaden our scope, it's not us and they, or them and us.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，如果我們擴大範圍，這不是我們和他們，或他們和我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. It's us, or there's nothing.
→ {"text": "要麼是我們，要麼什麼都沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. I think it's that important, and I don't have the answer for it now.
→ {"text": "我認為這很重要，而且我現在沒有答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. I just know that there's something here that we've touched on, at least in my little experience in these eight hours.
→ {"text": "我只知道我們在這裡觸及了一些東西，至少在我這八小時的小小經歷中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. It's something to build on, and I want us to consider that.

313. The military industrial financial complex is real.
→ {"text": "軍事工業金融複合體是真實存在的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. It's real.
→ {"text": "它是真實的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. I mean, and everyone knows it.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，每個人都知道這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. Not to be thrown stones at, but to work with.
→ {"text": "不是要向其投擲石頭，而是要與之合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. And I think when we bring them in as partners, because actually the complex has more power than the president.
→ {"text": "我認為當我們將他們納入為合作夥伴時，因為實際上這個複合體擁有比總統更大的權力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. I'm sorry.

323. I hate to just put that on record.

324. The president-- not the person, but the office is what I speak.
→ {"text": "總統——不是指這個人，而是指這個職位，這是我所說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. That when we deal with it as, again, as a whole thing, and not us over here and them over there, we can do this, Stephen.
→ {"text": "當我們把它作為一個整體來處理，而不是我們在這裡、他們在那裡時，我們可以做到這一點，史蒂芬。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. It's just going to take, I think, an international coalition that would help-- someone just said it-- help bring us to where we want to go to do some of the things that we need to do.
→ {"text": "我認為這只需要一個國際聯盟來幫助——剛才有人說過——幫助我們到達我們想去的地方，做一些我們需要做的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. And then, finally for me, the Military Intelligence Committee, we have to have that.
→ {"text": "最後對我來說，軍事情報委員會，我們必須擁有它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. And it exists.
→ {"text": "它是存在的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. And we've always thought that it helps us do a lot of things, like Boston most recently, and as big as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and all have been all over the world in this job of mine, but I haven't in this capacity.
→ {"text": "我們一直認為它幫助我們做很多事情，比如最近的波士頓事件，以及伊朗、伊拉克、阿富汗這樣的大事，我在這份工作中走遍了全世界，但我還沒有以這種身份參與。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. I'm offering myself for that.
→ {"text": "我願意為此貢獻自己。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. I see that we can get to this.
→ {"text": "我看到我們可以實現這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. This was a brilliant way to start it, Stephen, and build on what you guys have already done for these last 50-plus years.
→ {"text": "這是一個絕佳的開始方式，史蒂芬，並在你們過去 50 多年所做的工作基礎上繼續建設。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. This is the 21st century.
→ {"text": "這是 21 世紀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. The 20th century is over.
→ {"text": "20 世紀已經結束了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. It's about coalitions and partnerships.
→ {"text": "這是關於聯盟和夥伴關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. And it's an international one that will save our world and our country.
→ {"text": "而國際聯盟將拯救我們的世界和我們的國家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. So to all of you there, I always say the woman, she brings a whole other perspective here.

338. Thank you, without notes and all of that.
→ {"text": "謝謝，沒有筆記和所有那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. If you harm God's animals, and something does from time to time, as you just described, in a way that we know nothing of, or there's no blood or other liquids, fluids, that's something that I believe, too, and I'm going to end on this.
→ {"text": "如果你傷害上帝的動物，而某些事物不時這樣做，正如你剛才描述的那樣，以我們一無所知的方式，或者沒有血液或其他液體、體液，這也是我相信的事情，我將以此結束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

340. I don't have a question.
→ {"text": "我沒有問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. I'm making my final statement of the day.

342. If you talk about everything we've talked about today, and this is just day one.
→ {"text": "如果你談論我們今天討論的一切，而這只是第一天。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. I can't even imagine what we're going to do the rest of the week.
→ {"text": "我甚至無法想象我們這週剩餘時間會做什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. But the hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, winds, I'm a biblical person.
→ {"text": "但颶風、龍捲風、火災、風暴，我是一個相信聖經的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. I believe it's biblical.
→ {"text": "我相信這是聖經所說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. I believe that everything that's going on, what we're talking about now, and the power that might be out there, that we, they, are scared it's going to overtake us.
→ {"text": "我相信正在發生的一切，我們現在討論的內容，以及可能存在的力量，我們、他們，害怕它會超越我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. It won't overtake us, because we're going to work with it.
→ {"text": "它不會超越我們，因為我們將與之合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. We're going to build a partnership.
→ {"text": "我們將建立夥伴關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. And the sooner that we get it done, the safer our children will be, the more protected our seniors will be who built these great countries, and the international connection is what we must do.
→ {"text": "我們越早完成它，我們的孩子就會越安全，建立這些偉大國家的老年人就會得到更多保護，而國際聯繫是我們必須做的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. [ Applause ] Congressman Cook.
→ {"text": "[掌聲] 庫克眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

354. I do want to say that I've been most interested in your references to Bill Richardson.
→ {"text": "我確實想說，我對你們提到比爾·理查森最感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. Now, I may not be a member of their party.
→ {"text": "現在，我可能不是他們政黨的成員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. I may be a member of a party that's opposed them on many, many things, but I have never known a more intelligent, and honest, and deeply committed members of the government, members of the administrations, and in many, in Congress and everything else, as they, and in cabinet positions that I think they held, plus were almost going to be holding.
→ {"text": "我可能是一個在許多、許多事情上反對他們的政黨成員，但我從未見過比他們更聰明、誠實、深具承諾的政府成員、行政部門成員，以及在國會和其他方面的成員，以及我認為他們擔任過的內閣職位，加上幾乎要擔任的職位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. So I, and I've been deeply impressed as I've known, even before today, before what you said, Stephen, that these people have been particularly prominent in wanting to end what you called the truth embargo.
→ {"text": "所以我，我深受感動，正如我所知，甚至在今天之前，在你說之前，史蒂芬，這些人在想要結束你所說的真相封鎖方面特別突出。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. Certainly, Richardson has made statements that he says, hey, definitely, just to have somebody of his stature say that something landed in Roswell, and we need to have those files.
→ {"text": "當然，理查森發表過聲明說，嘿，肯定的，僅僅是讓他這樣地位的人說羅斯威爾事件有東西降落，我們需要那些檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

359. The reason I'm putting that back under this question is because I can already tell, especially from our luncheon discussion as former members of the Congress, that there seems to be developing a consensus that whatever we think of the evidence at this point, we think there needs to be hearings, and there needs to be official hearings.
→ {"text": "我將此放回這個問題之下的原因是，我已經可以看出，特別是從我們作為前國會議員的午餐討論中，似乎正在形成共識，無論我們目前對證據有何看法，我們認為需要舉行聽證會，而且需要舉行正式聽證會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. Again, I'm, I'm impressed that the attorney, I forget his name right now.
→ {"text": "再次，我，我對那位律師印象深刻，我現在忘記他的名字了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

361. Daniel Sheehan.
→ {"text": "丹尼爾·希恩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

362. Yes. But although he called for UA hearings initially, he kind of just was talking as his last statement that we need congressional hearings.
→ {"text": "是的。但儘管他最初呼籲 UA 聽證會，他最後的聲明基本上是說我們需要國會聽證會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. Now, I don't know whether this group, this panel should be focusing on members of the Congress to do something or members of the administration to do something, and I also, or maybe both, I shouldn't use the expression rats chasing rats, but maybe that's not such a bad example.
→ {"text": "現在，我不知道這個團體、這個小組應該專注於讓國會議員做些什麼，還是讓行政部門成員做些什麼，我也，或者也許兩者兼有，我不應該使用「老鼠追老鼠」這個表達，但也許這不是一個壞例子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

364. Well, it's a little bit, but you know, here's the nice thing about the new media.
→ {"text": "嗯，有一點，但你知道，新媒體的好處是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. We have a world now where we can stream.
→ {"text": "我們現在擁有一個可以串流的世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. The Huffington Post, okay, the Huffington Post did an article about the film Sirius that's just been released that's based on our work.
→ {"text": "《赫芬頓郵報》，好的，《赫芬頓郵報》發表了一篇關於剛剛發布的電影《天狼星》的文章，該電影基於我們的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. It had like 4 million people look at it.
→ {"text": "大約有 400 萬人觀看了它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. I think that we can do a lot that we couldn't have done 12 years ago, 5 years ago with the new media and the people's media.
→ {"text": "我認為藉助新媒體和人民的媒體，我們可以做很多 12 年前、5 年前做不到的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. That's one thing.
→ {"text": "這是一件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. The other is that I would, I want to put out a call for other witnesses from inside the military, intelligence, and corporate world to come forward, but who will come forward, rank, serial number, name, actionable intelligence.
→ {"text": "另一件事是，我想呼籲來自軍事、情報和企業界內部的其他證人站出來，但要站出來的人，軍銜、編號、姓名、可操作的情報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. One thing I want to comment on, there is a confusion that's been in the room a little bit today between access and control.
→ {"text": "我想評論一件事，今天房間裡對訪問權和控制權之間存在一些混淆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. Now, I just want to say that I have been able to provide actionable intelligence to where there would be access, but you don't necessarily have control, and I think we have to understand the difference for the president and for even some of these senior military officials that I've met with and continue to meet with.
→ {"text": "現在，我只想說，我已經能夠提供可操作的情報，讓他們可以訪問，但你不一定擁有控制權，我認為我們必須理解對於總統以及我會見過並繼續會見的一些高級軍事官員來說的區別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. There is a huge problem there, and this is something that does need to be fixed.
→ {"text": "這裡存在一個巨大的問題，這是需要解決的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

374. The media is one part, the public is one part.
→ {"text": "媒體是一部分，公眾是一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. I think we have to get all these components going, but something that needs to be looked at from a constitutional and national security point of view is that you cannot have information like this being withheld from the commander in chief and senior people like the Defense Intelligence Agency head or the CIA director, which we know is going on.
→ {"text": "我認為我們必須讓所有這些組成部分運作起來，但從憲法和國家安全的角度來看，需要審視的一件事是，你不能讓這樣的信息對三軍統帥以及國防情報局局長或 CIA 局長等高級人員隱瞞，而我們知道這種情況正在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. And I think that if we cannot fix that, our democracy is in danger, but so is our world.
→ {"text": "我認為如果我們不能解決這個問題，我們的民主就處於危險之中，我們的世界也是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. Thank you.

## Speaker Group 45

379. Okay, our cleanup batter is Congresswoman Hooley.
→ {"text": "好的，我們的最後一棒是胡利眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

380. Well, I'm going to follow up on the question, what you just said, Mr. Greer, and that is you talk about access, talk about control.
→ {"text": "嗯，我將跟進這個問題，格里爾先生，你剛才說的，那就是你談到訪問權、談到控制權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. How do we, all of us, change that around so that the president feels in control or the person that heads up an agency feels in control?
→ {"text": "我們所有人如何扭轉這種局面，讓總統感到擁有控制權，或讓領導機構的人感到擁有控制權？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. Give me some of your suggestions.
→ {"text": "給我一些你的建議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

383. Well, you know, one of the most poignant things that happened some years ago when I was wrapping up my almost three-hour meeting with the CIA director was that I gave him something very much like this that has a bunch of recommendations for executive action, executive orders, and he looked at me squarely in the eyes, and he said, "Dr. Greer, how do we disclose that which we don't have control over?"
→ {"text": "嗯，你知道，幾年前發生的最令人心酸的事情之一是，當我結束與 CIA 局長近三小時的會議時，我給了他一份非常像這樣的文件，其中包含一系列行政行動、行政命令的建議，他直視我的眼睛說：「格里爾博士，我們如何揭露我們無法控制的東西？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

384. And I said, "You get control over it."
→ {"text": "我說：「你去控制它。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. Now, you have to, I hate to use the term, lean into it and lean into it hard.
→ {"text": "現在，你必須，我不喜歡用這個詞，但要全力投入，而且要非常用力地投入。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. I mean, the powers of the Congress and the powers of the presidency and the courts are substantial, and I think that if they are then denied access control over projects that we can prove are going on, that there should be serious consequences to that because that is treason.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，國會的權力、總統的權力和法院的權力是巨大的，我認為如果他們被拒絕訪問和控制我們可以證明正在進行的項目，那應該有嚴重的後果，因為那是叛國罪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. And I think that the other point is that the public have to demand this level of transparency, which, and then ultimately, there needs to be a level of compassion for those who are trapped in a system that they are terrified to take on, and I think that this is why there has to also be a level of protection for people who want to step forward, who are deep insiders.
→ {"text": "我認為另一點是，公眾必須要求這種透明度水平，然後最終，需要對那些被困在他們害怕對抗的體系中的人表示同情，我認為這就是為什麼也必須為想要站出來的深層內部人士提供一定程度的保護。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. I mean, I would love to give a list of names of folks that I have met with in very high and deep positions, but they've asked me not to.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我很想給出我在非常高層和深層職位上會見過的人的名單，但他們要求我不要這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. I recently put on YouTube the testimony of a man who had worked with the CIA who would not let me release it until he died, and it's up there now, [witness name], go look at it.
→ {"text": "我最近在 YouTube 上發布了一位曾在 CIA 工作的人的證詞，他直到去世才允許我發布，現在就在那裡，[證人姓名]，去看看。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文 'palette' 是轉錄錯誤，應為證人姓名"}

390. I think that it deals with something you'll hear about later, implants, which were actually developed by the CIA in the '70s and '80s.
→ {"text": "我認為它涉及你們稍後會聽到的東西，植入物，這實際上是 CIA 在 70 年代和 80 年代開發的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. My point is that we have to also understand that many of these men and women who come forward are enormously courageous, but there are many others who would like to, but they can't just do it in some kind of a circus.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我們還必須理解，許多站出來的男性和女性都非常勇敢，但還有許多其他人想這樣做，但他們不能在某種馬戲團中這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. They also have to be assured of their protection and their safety.
→ {"text": "他們還必須確保自己的保護和安全。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. And I can address the whole intimidation issue from something that happened.
→ {"text": "我可以從發生的事情來談整個威脅問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. People are so afraid for their lives, their families, because they have had to sign non-disclosure agreements in which they basically are told if you say anything to anyone, your family will suffer because you will not only be put in prison, but all benefits will be denied your family.
→ {"text": "人們非常害怕他們的生命、他們的家人，因為他們必須簽署保密協議，其中基本上告訴他們，如果你對任何人說任何話，你的家人將受到傷害，因為你不僅會被關進監獄，而且你的家人將被剝奪所有福利。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. I've talked with several people who have signed such disclosure agreements that are working on some capacity in the extraterrestrial issue.
→ {"text": "我與幾位簽署了此類保密協議的人交談過，他們以某種身份從事外星議題的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. And this really came home to me, probably this was back around 1985, '86.
→ {"text": "這確實讓我深有感觸，大概是在 1985、1986 年左右。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. A security guard at Lockheed Martin in the facility in Denver had approached me because she had read my book, my first book, An Alien Harvest.
→ {"text": "洛克希德·馬丁在丹佛設施的一名保安人員接近我，因為她讀過我的書，我的第一本書《異形收割》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. And she had asked for an autograph at some place where I was speaking.
→ {"text": "她在我演講的某個地方要求簽名。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. And she volunteered, she said if you need any help with anything, I'll help you.
→ {"text": "她主動說，如果你需要任何幫助，我會幫助你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. And she began to do some filing and various things.
→ {"text": "她開始做一些歸檔和各種事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. And she was very, I guess you would say she was, she felt that An Alien Harvest was a book that should be out there in the world.
→ {"text": "她非常，我想你會說她是，她覺得《異形收割》是一本應該在世界上流傳的書。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. And one day she told me, she had a friend working inside of Lockheed Martin in a position that was related to something that they were doing in aerospace, but it was classified.
→ {"text": "有一天她告訴我，她有一位朋友在洛克希德·馬丁內部工作，職位與他們在航空航天領域所做的某些事情有關，但這是機密的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. It was one of those office complexes where you had to have the need to know in order to enter or the red and the blue lights would spin.
→ {"text": "這是那些辦公大樓之一，你必須有「需要知道」的權限才能進入，否則紅燈和藍燈會旋轉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. And she invited him as a friend to go out to dinner or something.
→ {"text": "她作為朋友邀請他出去吃晚飯或什麼的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. And he said, why don't you come over for, we're having a birthday party next weekend.
→ {"text": "他說，你為什麼不過來，我們下週末有一個生日派對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. So this is somebody who has a confidential position and now she's going to the house.
→ {"text": "所以這是一個擁有機密職位的人，現在她要去他家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. And she said, I just thought your book would be the most perfect gift.
→ {"text": "她說，我只是覺得你的書會是最完美的禮物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. And she said, I presented your book and he took it and he looked at it and he spun through the pages as if he already knew and he dropped it on the floor and said, take this from this house, put it in your car and don't ever talk with me about this again.
→ {"text": "她說，我把你的書遞給他，他拿著它看了看，翻了翻頁面，好像他已經知道了，然後把它扔在地上說，把這個從這房子裡拿走，放進你的車裡，不要再跟我談論這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. And she was shocked because she didn't know that the classified area must have had something very intimately to do with the subjects in an alien harvest, which was about animal mutilations, extraterrestrials, law enforcement and medical research in something that the government denies.
→ {"text": "她感到震驚，因為她不知道那個機密區域肯定與《異形收割》中的主題密切相關，該書講述的是動物肢解、外星人、執法和醫學研究，這些都是政府否認的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. And that is happening in so many ways where people become so intimidated that they will not even accept the book.
→ {"text": "這種情況以多種方式發生，人們變得如此害怕，以至於他們甚至不會接受這本書。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
