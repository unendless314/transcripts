## Speaker Group 33

253. Can you come to any other conclusion as a body that our nation is essentially ruled by a military junta?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. Can you come to any other conclusion based upon all the statements that have been made?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

255. Well, I think, yeah, I think it's not just military.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. I think it's a large macroeconomic and financial system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. So it's the military, industrial, corporate, financial complex, and I'm not against corporations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

258. However, as Jefferson said, the unchecked power of a corporation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. And see, if our budget is $3.8 trillion, but we're talking about something that if it's disclosed would threaten the privately owned interest in the oil, gas, coal, utility industries that are estimated in the multi-hundred trillions of dollars, what tail is wagging the dog of our democracy?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. And that's the big question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

261. Let me add to that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. I came across a study two years ago in Switzerland, Zurich, where an institute studied the interlocking directorates, 43,000 corporations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. They winnowed it down to 1,350 corporations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. And these are interlocking directorates, interlocking family ties.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. And primarily the top 10 were banks, international banks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. And they own 60% of the wealth of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

267. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

268. You're aware of that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

269. Yes, I'm very aware of that study, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

270. Congresswoman Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

271. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. This has been an absolutely awesome day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. The professional testimony that we've heard, awesome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. Everything that you've said here, this congressperson knows it to be true from things that we've done in our own lives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. President and the military is always a friction there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. Governors and their state and military or police troops, it's a little friction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. Mayors and their police force, it's a little something there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. Who has the power?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. I think that's an inherent something that our world witnesses, and I certainly have over my 60 plus years of life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. I think it's important that we work with the foreign governments.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. There's been 10 or 15 already identified who have acknowledged this existence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. I want to be a part of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. I want to go, I want to see, I want to -- all of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. And I'm presenting myself for that because I want to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. [ Applause ] The public-private partnerships that I mentioned earlier today got to do it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. Once upon a time, this country had horse and buggies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. We moved to cars, and now it's moving to something else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. There were no emails and computers and all of that two decades ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. I mean, evolving.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. When you talk about oil, gas, and coal, yeah, that's the money, and it's about money and power.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. But who's to say you can't transition that to what we're talking about here today with the kind of partnerships that we have to build in order to do that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. So we phase out of oil, gas, and coal, and we're doing it already, but we're just not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. I don't think this issue is now that I've sat here all day is separate from it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. I'm sure I'll know more about this by the Friday.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. But I think we have to look at it in terms of a comprehensive something that's related rather than separate from.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. The things that you all have testified today, and I know them to be true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. I don't even know people who have had this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. And in the last month since they found out I'm on it, I get all kind of things from around the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. I'm happy you're going to be listening, and I'm happy that I am listening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. But I want us to consider who that public private doctor for exactly Dr. Greer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. Excellent information, all of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. Got to be funded.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. I do money.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. That's what I've done in my career.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. I don't have any, but I mean, that's where I work.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. That's where I work.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. But we can do this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. I mean, we can do that with-- if we broaden our scope, it's not us and they, or them and us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. It's us, or there's nothing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. I think it's that important, and I don't have the answer for it now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. I just know that there's something here that we've touched on, at least in my little experience in these eight hours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. It's something to build on, and I want us to consider that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. The military industrial financial complex is real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. It's real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. I mean, and everyone knows it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. It's a real entity, and it really directs our world in the various countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. I can't speak for them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. I can speak for US.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. And it's real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. Not to be thrown stones at, but to work with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. And I think when we bring them in as partners, because actually the complex has more power than the president.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. I'm sorry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. I hate to just put that on record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. The president-- not the person, but the office is what I speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. That when we deal with it as, again, as a whole thing, and not us over here and them over there, we can do this, Stephen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. It's just going to take, I think, an international coalition that would help-- someone just said it-- help bring us to where we want to go to do some of the things that we need to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. And then, finally for me, the Military Intelligence Committee, we have to have that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. And it exists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. And we've always thought that it helps us do a lot of things, like Boston most recently, and as big as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and all have been all over the world in this job of mine, but I haven't in this capacity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. I'm offering myself for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. I see that we can get to this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. This was a brilliant way to start it, Stephen, and build on what you guys have already done for these last 50-plus years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. This is the 21st century.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. The 20th century is over.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. It's about coalitions and partnerships.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. And it's an international one that will save our world and our country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. So to all of you there, I always say the woman, she brings a whole other perspective here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. Thank you, without notes and all of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. If you harm God's animals, and something does from time to time, as you just described, in a way that we know nothing of, or there's no blood or other liquids, fluids, that's something that I believe, too, and I'm going to end on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. I don't have a question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. I'm making my final statement of the day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. If you talk about everything we've talked about today, and this is just day one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. I can't even imagine what we're going to do the rest of the week.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. But the hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, winds, I'm a biblical person.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. I believe it's biblical.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. I believe that everything that's going on, what we're talking about now, and the power that might be out there, that we, they, are scared it's going to overtake us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. It won't overtake us, because we're going to work with it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. We're going to build a partnership.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. And the sooner that we get it done, the safer our children will be, the more protected our seniors will be who built these great countries, and the international connection is what we must do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. So for all of you today who've come before us and become, for me specifically, I just want to say thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. It's not the end, it's just the beginning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. [ Applause ] Congressman Cook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

354. I do want to say that I've been most interested in your references to Bill Richardson.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. Now, I may not be a member of their party.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. I may be a member of a party that's opposed them on many, many things, but I have never known a more intelligent, and honest, and deeply committed members of the government, members of the administrations, and in many, in Congress and everything else, as they, and in cabinet positions that I think they held, plus were almost going to be holding.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. So I, and I've been deeply impressed as I've known, even before today, before what you said, Stephen, that these people have been particularly prominent in wanting to end what you called the truth embargo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. Certainly, Richardson has made statements that he says, hey, definitely, just to have somebody of his stature say that something landed in Roswell, and we need to have those files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. The reason I'm putting that back under this question is because I can already tell, especially from our luncheon discussion as former members of the Congress, that there seems to be developing a consensus that whatever we think of the evidence at this point, we think there needs to be hearings, and there needs to be official hearings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. Again, I'm, I'm impressed that the attorney, I forget his name right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

361. Daniel Sheehan.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

362. Yes. But although he called for UA hearings initially, he kind of just was talking as his last statement that we need congressional hearings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. Now, I don't know whether this group, this panel should be focusing on members of the Congress to do something or members of the administration to do something, and I also, or maybe both, I shouldn't use the expression rats chasing rats, but maybe that's not such a bad example.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

364. Well, it's a little bit, but you know, here's the nice thing about the new media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. We have a world now where we can stream.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. The Huffington Post, okay, the Huffington Post did an article about the film Sirius that's just been released that's based on our work.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. It had like 4 million people look at it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. I think that we can do a lot that we couldn't have done 12 years ago, 5 years ago with the new media and the people's media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. That's one thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. The other is that I would, I want to put out a call for other witnesses from inside the military, intelligence, and corporate world to come forward, but who will come forward, rank, serial number, name, actionable intelligence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. One thing I want to comment on, there is a confusion that's been in the room a little bit today between access and control.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. Now, I just want to say that I have been able to provide actionable intelligence to where there would be access, but you don't necessarily have control, and I think we have to understand the difference for the president and for even some of these senior military officials that I've met with and continue to meet with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. There is a huge problem there, and this is something that does need to be fixed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. The media is one part, the public is one part.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. I think we have to get all these components going, but something that needs to be looked at from a constitutional and national security point of view is that you cannot have information like this being withheld from the commander in chief and senior people like the Defense Intelligence Agency head or the CIA director, which we know is going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. And I think that if we cannot fix that, our democracy is in danger, but so is our world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. [ Applause ]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

379. Okay, our cleanup batter is Congresswoman Hooley.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

380. Well, I'm going to follow up on the question, what you just said, Mr. Greer, and that is you talk about access, talk about control.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. How do we, all of us, change that around so that the president feels in control or the person that heads up an agency feels in control?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Give me some of your suggestions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

383. Well, you know, one of the most poignant things that happened some years ago when I was wrapping up my almost three-hour meeting with the CIA director was that I gave him something very much like this that has a bunch of recommendations for executive action, executive orders, and he looked at me squarely in the eyes, and he said, "Dr. Greer, how do we disclose that which we don't have control over?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. And I said, "You get control over it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. Now, you have to, I hate to use the term, lean into it and lean into it hard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. I mean, the powers of the Congress and the powers of the presidency and the courts are substantial, and I think that if they are then denied access control over projects that we can prove are going on, that there should be serious consequences to that because that is treason.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. And I think that the other point is that the public have to demand this level of transparency, which, and then ultimately, there needs to be a level of compassion for those who are trapped in a system that they are terrified to take on, and I think that this is why there has to also be a level of protection for people who want to step forward, who are deep insiders.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. I mean, I would love to give a list of names of folks that I have met with in very high and deep positions, but they've asked me not to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. I recently put on YouTube the testimony of a man who had worked with the CIA who would not let me release it until he died, and it's up there now, [witness name], go look at it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. I think that it deals with something you'll hear about later, implants, which were actually developed by the CIA in the '70s and '80s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. My point is that we have to also understand that many of these men and women who come forward are enormously courageous, but there are many others who would like to, but they can't just do it in some kind of a circus.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. They also have to be assured of their protection and their safety.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

393. And I can address the whole intimidation issue from something that happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. People are so afraid for their lives, their families, because they have had to sign non-disclosure agreements in which they basically are told if you say anything to anyone, your family will suffer because you will not only be put in prison, but all benefits will be denied your family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. I've talked with several people who have signed such disclosure agreements that are working on some capacity in the extraterrestrial issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. And this really came home to me, probably this was back around 1985, '86.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. A security guard at Lockheed Martin in the facility in Denver had approached me because she had read my book, my first book, An Alien Harvest.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. And she had asked for an autograph at some place where I was speaking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. And she volunteered, she said if you need any help with anything, I'll help you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. And she began to do some filing and various things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. And she was very, I guess you would say she was, she felt that An Alien Harvest was a book that should be out there in the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. And one day she told me, she had a friend working inside of Lockheed Martin in a position that was related to something that they were doing in aerospace, but it was classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. It was one of those office complexes where you had to have the need to know in order to enter or the red and the blue lights would spin.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. And she invited him as a friend to go out to dinner or something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. And he said, why don't you come over for, we're having a birthday party next weekend.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. So this is somebody who has a confidential position and now she's going to the house.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. And she said, I just thought your book would be the most perfect gift.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. And she said, I presented your book and he took it and he looked at it and he spun through the pages as if he already knew and he dropped it on the floor and said, take this from this house, put it in your car and don't ever talk with me about this again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. And she was shocked because she didn't know that the classified area must have had something very intimately to do with the subjects in an alien harvest, which was about animal mutilations, extraterrestrials, law enforcement and medical research in something that the government denies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. And that is happening in so many ways where people become so intimidated that they will not even accept the book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

411. I think I'm okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

412. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. [ Applause ]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

414. So this is the close of day one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. We have four more days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. And I want to compliment all of you out there in the audience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. I guess your audience, your participants as far as I can tell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. And you stayed all day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. And I hope you're here all the way through Friday because you are amazing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. And our witnesses have been great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. [ Applause ]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
