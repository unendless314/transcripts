118. Well on that note, it reminds me of a conversation I had with some people at the CIA and there's a term that's used there and you'll forgive my vernacular where much of this subject is referred to as WSFM, sounds like a radio station, it means weird science and fricking magic and that is the term that's used at the CIA and other places to describe some of this and I think that what we have to understand is that if you're dealing with and I do want to go into this because this is part of the summary and brief I provided for in the Obama briefing and elsewhere, if you're dealing with civilizations that are 10 to the 6th to 10 to the 7th years, hundreds of thousands to millions of years, technologically more developed than we are, every manifestation of their technology would look like magic to us.
→ {"text": "嗯，關於這一點，這讓我想起我與 CIA 一些人的對話，那裡有一個專門術語，請原諒我的俗語，這個主題的大部分內容被稱為 WSFM，聽起來像個廣播電台，它的意思是詭異科學與魔法，這是 CIA 和其他地方用來描述這類現象的術語，我認為我們必須理解的是，如果你正在處理——而我確實想深入探討這一點，因為這是我在歐巴馬簡報和其他場合提供的摘要和簡報的一部分——如果你正在處理技術比我們先進 10 的 6 次方到 10 的 7 次方年、也就是數十萬到數百萬年的文明，他們的技術的每一個表現在我們看來都像魔法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

119. For example, if you were to go back to the time of Thomas Jefferson and show them an iPhone or worse to say in Massachusetts, you'd be burned at the stake as a witch because everything would be absolutely look like magic.
→ {"text": "例如，如果你回到 Thomas Jefferson 的時代，向他們展示一部 iPhone，或者更糟的是在 Massachusetts，你會被當作女巫綁在火刑柱上燒死，因為所有事情看起來絕對就像魔法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. So I think that we have to have a certain amount of humility in realizing that we're dealing with a universe that is vast and infinite, that in our own galaxy alone, which has 100 billion star systems, the same number of stars as we have neurons in our brain interestingly, that we're dealing with civilizations just in our own galaxy which is one of billions that are able to go through interstellar space.
→ {"text": "因此，我認為我們必須抱持一定程度的謙卑，認識到我們正在處理一個廣闊而無限的宇宙，僅在我們自己的銀河系中就有 1000 億個恆星系統，有趣的是，這個數字與我們大腦中的神經元數量相同，我們正在處理的文明僅在我們自己的銀河系中就有數十億個，它們能夠穿越星際空間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. Now I want to touch on this for a moment because it deals with a little bit that Linda referred to in terms of trans-dimensional or other dimensions and the technologies and the sciences dealing with this subject are what we have termed trans-dimensional interstellar, TDIs and this refers to very advanced sciences and technologies where there is a nexus between electromagnetism in the magnetic field, gravitational forces in three-dimensional space and time and what Dr. Jahn at Princeton in the engineering lab began to prove is the science of consciousness which was actually an issue that I did talk a fair amount with Lawrence Rockefeller about.
→ {"text": "現在我想簡短談一下這個問題，因為這涉及 Linda 提到的跨維度或其他維度的部分，而處理這個主題的技術和科學就是我們所稱的跨維度星際，簡稱 TDI，這指的是非常先進的科學和技術，其中電磁學與磁場、三維空間與時間中的重力、以及普林斯頓大學工程實驗室的簡博士開始證明的意識科學之間存在一個連結點，而這實際上是我與勞倫斯·洛克菲勒談論相當多的一個議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. Now a lot of people say well this gets into the deep end of the pool very quickly and in fact it does but I think that it's important to understand that if you're dealing with civilizations that have gotten here and that's what we're dealing with, you're not dealing with something that can go just straight through space at the speed of light even because the speed of light is too slow.
→ {"text": "現在很多人說，嗯，這很快就進入深水區了，事實上確實如此，但我認為重要的是要理解，如果你正在處理已經到達這裡的文明——而這正是我們正在處理的——你處理的不是一種甚至可以僅以光速直線穿越空間的東西，因為光速太慢了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. And I remember when I was having dinner with CIA Director Wolsey and his wife and actually the really most insightful question came from Dr. Wolsey who at the time was Chief Operating Officer of the National Academy of Sciences and she said what I want to know is how are these civilizations communicating across the vastness of space because your cell phone and radio waves are going at the speed of light and I said yes that's just too slow, speed of light is way too slow.
→ {"text": "我記得當我與 CIA 局長伍爾西及其妻子共進晚餐時，實際上最具洞察力的問題來自伍爾西博士，她當時是美國國家科學院的營運長，她說她想知道的是這些文明如何跨越浩瀚的太空進行通訊，因為你的手機和無線電波都是以光速傳播的，我說是的，那太慢了，光速太慢了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. And I had to, I had a gut check, I said do I tell her the truth and lose all credibility as a scientist and a doctor or do I tell her something that sounds scientific but that's really not true and ever since then I have vowed that if someone is intelligent enough to ask the question I will provide the answers truthfully as I can so I turned to her and I said well Dr. Wolsey it's like this, it turns out thinking is the best way to travel and the speed of thought is not quantifiable.
→ {"text": "我必須做出直覺判斷，我問自己，我是要告訴她真相並失去作為科學家和醫生的所有可信度，還是告訴她一些聽起來科學但實際上不真實的東西，從那時起我就發誓，如果有人足夠聰明提出問題，我就會盡可能真實地提供答案，所以我轉向她說，嗯，伍爾西博士，是這樣的，事實證明思考是最佳旅行方式，而思維的速度是無法量化的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

125. However, when you start getting into the new physics that have been done where you have the ability to teleport across vast distances instantly and this has been done with particles but we're talking about civilizations that can do it with entire spacecraft and occupants, you're dealing with an entirely new physics but their communication devices and their own innate abilities allow for thought actuated events and I know Dr. Wood may mention this and that he discovered when he was doing some work for Old Mac McDonald and McDonald Douglas that he looked into some cases where in some meetings with these ETs involved a little box and there was a direct thought communication but it was also being facilitated through electronics and this is something that we call technology assisted consciousness and thought and this is a very specific area
→ {"text": "然而，當你開始進入已經完成的新物理學領域，其中你有能力瞬間傳送跨越遙遠距離，這已經在粒子上完成了，但我們談論的是能夠對整個太空船和乘員做到這一點的文明，你正在處理一個全新的物理學，但他們的通訊設備和他們自己的天生能力允許思維致動事件，我知道伍德博士可能會提到這一點，他在為老麥克唐納和麥克唐納·道格拉斯做一些工作時發現，他研究了一些案例，在一些與這些外星人的會議中涉及一個小盒子，有直接的思維通訊，但也透過電子設備促成，這是我們所稱的科技輔助意識與思維，這是一個非常特定的領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. of study that I really devoted about 22 years to which may be beyond the scope of this hearing but I think that in terms of just bringing this issue around there are so many aspects of it that are very exciting from the point of view of science, technology and understanding the universe and ourselves and also who are we and where did we come from and how is it that we exist in this cosmos and I agree with Edgar Mitchell on this that is a conscious quantum hologram that is awake and that we are all part of and that mind itself is the ultimate final frontier not space but consciousness in mind.
→ {"text": "我真正投入了大約 22 年的研究領域，這可能超出了本次聽證會的範圍，但我認為，就將這個議題帶回來而言，從科學、技術和理解宇宙與我們自己的角度來看，它有很多非常令人興奮的方面，還有我們是誰、我們從哪裡來、我們如何存在於這個宇宙中，我在這一點上同意埃德加·米切爾的觀點，這是一個有意識的量子全息，它是清醒的，我們都是其中的一部分，心智本身才是終極的最後邊疆，不是太空，而是意識與心智。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. Now I know that Lawrence Rockefeller was very interested in these things because I had conversations with him also but one of the things that I found when I was working with these folks is that there's a saying in American business everyone wants to be first to be second and so in this case there's so many people who have had an interest of this but they want to hold back and not speak the whole truth about it but I think we need to be able to liberate ourselves to speak the truth and it involves many, many complex issues part of which has been touched on in the last 15 or 20 minutes.
→ {"text": "現在我知道勞倫斯·洛克菲勒對這些事情非常感興趣，因為我也和他有過對話，但我在與這些人合作時發現的一件事是，美國商界有句話說每個人都想成為第二個第一，所以在這種情況下，有很多人對此感興趣，但他們想退縮，不願說出全部真相，但我認為我們需要能夠解放自己來說出真相，這涉及許多、許多複雜的議題，其中一部分在過去 15 或 20 分鐘內已經觸及。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. One thing I also want to point out is that if we're being visited by advanced civilizations and it's our assessment that certainly we are, who is handling that relationship?
→ {"text": "我還想指出的一件事是，如果我們正被先進文明造訪——而我們的評估確實是如此——誰在處理這種關係？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. Do we cede that management to the military industrial complex and what are the consequences of doing so?
→ {"text": "我們是否將這種管理權讓給軍事工業複合體，這樣做的後果是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. Think about this very carefully.
→ {"text": "請非常仔細地思考這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. I remember doing a meeting with the Boutros Boutros-Ghali family, the UN Secretary General, his wife Leah Golly and we were talking about this and Leah Golly turned to me and she said, "Dr. Grier, we need you to do this now."
→ {"text": "我記得與布特羅斯·布特羅斯-加利家族——聯合國秘書長、他的妻子利亞·加利——進行了一次會面，我們談論這個議題，利亞·加利轉向我說：「格里爾博士，我們需要你現在就做這件事。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. I said, "I'm a country doctor in North Carolina rattling around in an emergency department.
→ {"text": "我說：「我是北卡羅來納州的鄉村醫生，在急診室裡忙碌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. You're the head of the world."
→ {"text": "您是世界的領袖。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. She says, "No, we can't.
→ {"text": "她說：「不，我們不能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. It's too dangerous for Boutrous."
→ {"text": "這對布特羅斯來說太危險了。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. I'm quoting and then I remember talking to this wonderful Senator Claiborne Pell who was mentioned earlier and I was speaking with him and I would never have gone to college if not for a Pell Grant because I was very, very, very poor.
→ {"text": "我引用的是原話，然後我記得與這位出色的克萊伯恩·佩爾參議員交談，他之前被提到過，我與他交談時，我永遠不會忘記如果不是因為裴爾助學金，我永遠無法上大學，因為我非常、非常、非常貧窮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. I grew up in North Carolina, I had no resources, put myself through the last years of high school and college and med school, but I mean really poor.
→ {"text": "我在北卡羅來納州長大，沒有任何資源，自己完成了高中最後幾年、大學和醫學院的學業，但我的意思是真的很窮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. And what I-- most people don't know that, but what I found when I was talking to Senator Pell who was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and I was at a meeting with Edgar Mitchell and some other folks and I looked at him and he said, "Dr. Grier, I have never been given any information on this even though I have inquired through any official channels."
→ {"text": "而我——大多數人不知道這一點，但我發現當我與佩爾參議員交談時，他是外交委員會主席，我當時與埃德加·米切爾和其他一些人在一個會議上，我看著他，他說：「格里爾博士，我從未得到任何關於這方面的資訊，儘管我透過任何官方管道詢問過。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. And I said, "Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "我說：「是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. What a shame because you, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have been denied the responsibility of dealing with the ultimate foreign relations issue."
→ {"text": "真是遺憾，因為您身為美國參議院外交委員會主席，卻被剝奪了處理終極外交關係議題的責任。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

141. And I pointed to the stars above our heads and he looked at me through those horn-rim glasses and said, "Well, you know, Dr. Grier, you may be right."
→ {"text": "我指著我們頭頂上的星空，他透過那副角框眼鏡看著我說：「嗯，你知道，格里爾博士，你可能是對的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. I said, "Well, I am."
→ {"text": "我說：「嗯，我確實是對的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. And I said, "Well, what a shame."
→ {"text": "我說：「嗯，真是遺憾。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. So I think this is another dimension.
→ {"text": "所以我認為這是另一個面向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. There's a science and technology part of it, but there's the part of it about relationships and we are not alone in the universe and we need to have a situation on this planet where our higher nature, our better angels, folks like Senator Pell and others who would approach this in an enlightened way could reach out and form what has begun to be discussed in the French government that I referred to earlier in this Ministry of Defense memo to me, a peaceful, interplanetary, interstellar diplomatic initiative.
→ {"text": "這有科學和技術的部分，但還有關於關係的部分，我們在宇宙中並不孤單，我們需要在這個星球上有一種情況，讓我們的高尚本性、我們更好的天使、像佩爾參議員這樣的人和其他會以開明方式處理這個問題的人能夠伸出手來，形成我之前在法國政府給我的國防部備忘錄中提到的已經開始討論的內容，一個和平的、跨行星的、跨星際的外交倡議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. And to be honest with you, that's how I first got involved with this, was to establish such an effort, which we are doing as a citizen's diplomatic effort.
→ {"text": "坦白說，這就是我最初參與這件事的方式，就是為了建立這樣一個努力，我們正在以公民外交努力的形式進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. But in the meanwhile, I got diverted into this morass of the national security state because I felt that our leaders need to know and more importantly, the public need to know.
→ {"text": "但與此同時，我被轉移到國家安全體制的這個泥沼中，因為我覺得我們的領導人需要知道，更重要的是，公眾需要知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. And we need to then figure out how we're going to advance.
→ {"text": "我們需要弄清楚我們將如何前進。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. And in the summary I did for the president, there are a number of action points.
→ {"text": "在我為總統做的摘要中，有許多行動要點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. And one of them is to appoint internationally a high level committee of folks who could go out and make a peaceful contact that is not militarized, that is not covert, that is not being run by the national security state, but is being done on behalf of all of us, the children of earth.
→ {"text": "其中之一是在國際上任命一個高層委員會，由能夠出去進行和平接觸的人組成，這種接觸不是軍事化的、不是秘密的、不是由國家安全體制運作的，而是代表我們所有人、地球之子進行的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. [ Applause ]
