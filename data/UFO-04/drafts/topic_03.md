## Speaker Group 18

118. Well on that note, it reminds me of a conversation I had with some people at the CIA and there's a term that's used there and you'll forgive my vernacular where much of this subject is referred to as WSFM, sounds like a radio station, it means weird science and fricking magic and that is the term that's used at the CIA and other places to describe some of this and I think that what we have to understand is that if you're dealing with and I do want to go into this because this is part of the summary and brief I provided for in the Obama briefing and elsewhere, if you're dealing with civilizations that are 10 to the 6th to 10 to the 7th years, hundreds of thousands to millions of years, technologically more developed than we are, every manifestation of their technology would look like magic to us.

119. For example, if you were to go back to the time of Thomas Jefferson and show them an iPhone or worse to say in Massachusetts, you'd be burned at the stake as a witch because everything would be absolutely look like magic.

120. So I think that we have to have a certain amount of humility in realizing that we're dealing with a universe that is vast and infinite, that in our own galaxy alone, which has 100 billion star systems, the same number of stars as we have neurons in our brain interestingly, that we're dealing with civilizations just in our own galaxy which is one of billions that are able to go through interstellar space.

121. Now I want to touch on this for a moment because it deals with a little bit that Linda referred to in terms of trans-dimensional or other dimensions and the technologies and the sciences dealing with this subject are what we have termed trans-dimensional interstellar, TDIs and this refers to very advanced sciences and technologies where there is a nexus between electromagnetism in the magnetic field, gravitational forces in three-dimensional space and time and what Dr. Jahn at Princeton in the engineering lab began to prove is the science of consciousness which was actually an issue that I did talk a fair amount with Lawrence Rockefeller about.

122. Now a lot of people say well this gets into the deep end of the pool very quickly and in fact it does but I think that it's important to understand that if you're dealing with civilizations that have gotten here and that's what we're dealing with, you're not dealing with something that can go just straight through space at the speed of light even because the speed of light is too slow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. And I remember when I was having dinner with CIA Director Wolsey and his wife and actually the really most insightful question came from Dr. Wolsey who at the time was Chief Operating Officer of the National Academy of Sciences and she said what I want to know is how are these civilizations communicating across the vastness of space because your cell phone and radio waves are going at the speed of light and I said yes that's just too slow, speed of light is way too slow.

124. And I had to, I had a gut check, I said do I tell her the truth and lose all credibility as a scientist and a doctor or do I tell her something that sounds scientific but that's really not true and ever since then I have vowed that if someone is intelligent enough to ask the question I will provide the answers truthfully as I can so I turned to her and I said well Dr. Wolsey it's like this, it turns out thinking is the best way to travel and the speed of thought is not quantifiable.

125. However, when you start getting into the new physics that have been done where you have the ability to teleport across vast distances instantly and this has been done with particles but we're talking about civilizations that can do it with entire spacecraft and occupants, you're dealing with an entirely new physics but their communication devices and their own innate abilities allow for thought actuated events and I know Dr. Wood may mention this and that he discovered when he was doing some work for Old Mac McDonald and McDonald Douglas that he looked into some cases where in some meetings with these ETs involved a little box and there was a direct thought communication but it was also being facilitated through electronics and this is something that we call technology assisted consciousness and thought and this is a very specific area

126. of study that I really devoted about 22 years to which may be beyond the scope of this hearing but I think that in terms of just bringing this issue around there are so many aspects of it that are very exciting from the point of view of science, technology and understanding the universe and ourselves and also who are we and where did we come from and how is it that we exist in this cosmos and I agree with Edgar Mitchell on this that is a conscious quantum hologram that is awake and that we are all part of and that mind itself is the ultimate final frontier not space but consciousness in mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. Now I know that Lawrence Rockefeller was very interested in these things because I had conversations with him also but one of the things that I found when I was working with these folks is that there's a saying in American business everyone wants to be first to be second and so in this case there's so many people who have had an interest of this but they want to hold back and not speak the whole truth about it but I think we need to be able to liberate ourselves to speak the truth and it involves many, many complex issues part of which has been touched on in the last 15 or 20 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. One thing I also want to point out is that if we're being visited by advanced civilizations and it's our assessment that certainly we are, who is handling that relationship?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. Do we cede that management to the military industrial complex and what are the consequences of doing so?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. Think about this very carefully.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. I remember doing a meeting with the Boutros Boutros-Ghali family, the UN Secretary General, his wife Leah Golly and we were talking about this and Leah Golly turned to me and she said, "Dr. Grier, we need you to do this now."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. I said, "I'm a country doctor in North Carolina rattling around in an emergency department.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. You're the head of the world."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. She says, "No, we can't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. It's too dangerous for Boutrous."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. I'm quoting and then I remember talking to this wonderful Senator Claiborne Pell who was mentioned earlier and I was speaking with him and I would never have gone to college if not for a Pell Grant because I was very, very, very poor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. I grew up in North Carolina, I had no resources, put myself through the last years of high school and college and med school, but I mean really poor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. And what I-- most people don't know that, but what I found when I was talking to Senator Pell who was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and I was at a meeting with Edgar Mitchell and some other folks and I looked at him and he said, "Dr. Grier, I have never been given any information on this even though I have inquired through any official channels."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. And I said, "Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. What a shame because you, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have been denied the responsibility of dealing with the ultimate foreign relations issue."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. And I pointed to the stars above our heads and he looked at me through those horn-rim glasses and said, "Well, you know, Dr. Grier, you may be right."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. I said, "Well, I am."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. And I said, "Well, what a shame."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. So I think this is another dimension.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. There's a science and technology part of it, but there's the part of it about relationships and we are not alone in the universe and we need to have a situation on this planet where our higher nature, our better angels, folks like Senator Pell and others who would approach this in an enlightened way could reach out and form what has begun to be discussed in the French government that I referred to earlier in this Ministry of Defense memo to me, a peaceful, interplanetary, interstellar diplomatic initiative.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. And to be honest with you, that's how I first got involved with this, was to establish such an effort, which we are doing as a citizen's diplomatic effort.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. But in the meanwhile, I got diverted into this morass of the national security state because I felt that our leaders need to know and more importantly, the public need to know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. And we need to then figure out how we're going to advance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. And in the summary I did for the president, there are a number of action points.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. And one of them is to appoint internationally a high level committee of folks who could go out and make a peaceful contact that is not militarized, that is not covert, that is not being run by the national security state, but is being done on behalf of all of us, the children of earth.
