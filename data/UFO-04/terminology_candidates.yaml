      Douglas that he looked into some cases where in some meetings with these ETs

      vernacular where much of this subject is referred to as WSFM, sounds like a
      radio station, it means weird science and fricking magic and that is the term
      that's used at the CIA and other places to describe some of this and I think
      that what we have to understand is that if you're dealing with and I do want
      to go into this because this is part of the summary and brief I provided for
      in the Obama briefing and elsewhere, if you're dealing with civilizations that
      are 10 to the 6th to 10 to the 7th years, hundreds of thousands to millions
      of years, technologically more developed than we are, every manifestation of
      their technology would look like magic to us.

      across the vastness of space because your cell phone and radio waves are going
