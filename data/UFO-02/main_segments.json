UFOs."},{"segment_id":160,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It wasn't any question about what they were."},{"segment_id":161,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It wasn't a light in the sky."},{"segment_id":162,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It wasn't a vague report about having seen something going very fast by."},{"segment_id":163,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These were photographs, official United States Air Force photographs, some taken through gun sights, but another one of a crashed saucer on the ground, that there was snow in the photographs."},{"segment_id":164,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It showed that the saucer had hit into a field and had plowed across the field and was stuck into a snowbank, set up about a 45-degree angle."},{"segment_id":165,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I could see in the photographs U.S. Air Force personnel dressed in heavy parkas taking actually film with those two cameras with the great big camera circles on top, the films like this, so it must have been in the 1950s."},{"segment_id":166,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I saw this, and I realized that I could see in one of the photographs symbols that were on the dome of the UFO sticking in the snowbank."},{"segment_id":167,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So what I did, I had one of those, they were the microfiche, those little machines you put the microfiche in, you crank the little handle, very high-tech this was."},{"segment_id":168,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so what I did is they had told me that I wasn't allowed to take any notes when I went in there."},{"segment_id":169,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The two security men at the door told me I was not allowed to take any notes, but I actually had a yellow pad under my arm when I went in like this, and so when I went in and when I saw these photographs, what I did is I cranked down the focus on the machine so that I could get a close-up view of these symbols that were around the dome of the UFO, and what I did is I opened up the yellow pad and I put the yellow pad in there and I traced the actual symbols that were along the base of the saucer, and then I closed it up and I said, \"I think I'd probably better leave now because I have this.\""},{"segment_id":170,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So what I did is I put all this stuff back into the boxes and I put the yellow pad under my arm and I walked back out, and the two security guys said, \"I'd like my briefcase back.\""},{"segment_id":171,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They handed me my briefcase and I started to walk away, and one of them says, \"What's that under your arm?\""},{"segment_id":172,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I said, \"Oh, this is a yellow pad,\" and he opened it up and he leafed through all the pages and there was nothing there, because I had put it on the inside of the cardboard."},{"segment_id":173,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so I took that back with me to Jesuit headquarters and I brought it to Father Bill Davis, who was my superior at the Jesuit headquarters, and we then agreed to go."},{"segment_id":174,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We gathered all 54 of the major religious denominations."},{"segment_id":175,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They're Washington, D.C. offices, and we brought them into a meeting and we proposed to them from the Jesuit national headquarters that we establish as a priority having the churches try to ascertain what information we could get, and that we would get the backing of the churches and then go to the Vatican Library and see if we could start to address this."},{"segment_id":176,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, that is what we did, and Father Bill Davis, when I asked him this, he got puzzled and he reached down and he pulled open the drawer out of his desk at the Jesuit headquarters right over by DuPont Circle, 1717 Mass Ave is where we were, and he opened up the drawer and he pulled out a photograph, and he said, \"This is a photograph that I got from my sister."},{"segment_id":177,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Her husband is in the tower in the Seattle, Washington airport."},{"segment_id":178,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He's a flight controller and his best friend is a commercial pilot, and he took this photograph out of his window of the commercial airline, and he handed me the photograph of this.\""},{"segment_id":179,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We showed this to the people at the Washington Interreligious Staff Council that we organized, asking them if they would make this a priority, and they said, \"Are there any other subjects you'd like to discuss?\""},{"segment_id":180,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Instead of that."},{"segment_id":181,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They didn't want to address that at that time, and what happened, I was contacted then by Marsha Smith, who was directing the investigation for President Carter at the Congressional Research Service, and she asked me if I would go to meet with the people at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California in the SETI Program, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and give them a briefing on the theological implications of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence."},{"segment_id":182,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was privileged to deliver a three-hour seminar to the top 50 scientists in the SETI Program on the theological implications of contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence."},{"segment_id":183,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Then in 1994, I was contacted by Dr. John Mack, who was the chairman of the Department of Clinical Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, because I had graduated from Harvard College and graduated from Harvard Law School, where I was one of the founders of the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review, and I had gone on to Harvard Divinity School."},{"segment_id":184,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He contacted me and asked me if I would represent him, because he had written a book based upon his clinical assistance to high-level military officials and others in the country who had been sent to have psychological background done on them, who had reported these direct contacts with extraterrestrial vehicles of this kind."},{"segment_id":185,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When I met with him, he had written this book, and the faculty committee at Harvard University had called him into a session with the legal counsel from Harvard University and the head of the dean of the medical school, getting ready to challenge his tenure for his having written this book, that it was undermining the worldview of Harvard University."},{"segment_id":186,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We met with Lawrence Rockefeller, and Lawrence Rockefeller agreed to fund what would really amount to grand rounds to present to the Harvard faculty all of the basic information that we had on the existence of UFOs."},{"segment_id":187,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They then dropped the hearings and said they didn't want to have these hearings turned into a circus."},{"segment_id":188,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now those were my initial contacts with them, and so I have delivered a number of presentations to the International UFO Congress over the years on the theological implications of contact with an extraterrestrial civilization."},{"segment_id":189,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As you may know, the Vatican has now started to issue press statements."},{"segment_id":190,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They actually held a major press conference talking about the fact that in light of the more recent discoveries of the increasing number of planets that they now realize have suns and atmosphere and are in what they call the Goldilocks zone."},{"segment_id":191,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They're close enough to their planet, their sun and their solar systems, but not so far away that they're likely to have potential life on them."},{"segment_id":192,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As these planets began to multiply, the Vatican has now held an official press conference announcing that they in fact have now taken the position that the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence in a highly technologically developed intelligence is not inconsistent with Catholic theology."},{"segment_id":193,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That is what is going on right now."},{"segment_id":194,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There are very high level meetings going on right now with the new pope to discuss what positions are going to be taken by the International Catholic Church with regard to the theology."},{"segment_id":195,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My understanding is as former chief council for the Jesuits that the fact is that the Catholic Church does not want to be behind the power curve on this issue."},{"segment_id":196,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They realize that with the increasing contact and discovery of these additional planets that it's going to become clear within our generation, within our lifetimes that in fact highly technologically developed extraterrestrial intelligence actually exists."},{"segment_id":197,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The findings of the Congressional Research Service that were delivered to President Carter is that based upon all of their analysis that they have come to the conclusion, this is an official conclusion of the Congressional Research Service, that they have come to a 95% probability projection that there are from 2 to 10 highly technologically developed extraterrestrial civilizations within our own galaxy."},{"segment_id":198,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, remember in closing, there in our galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, there are 50 billion star systems in our galaxy and there are 50 billion trillion galaxies that are now known."},{"segment_id":199,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The question and the abiding question and it's the one that you and I discussed last night, Congressman Bartlett, have these vehicles developed the capacity to transport vehicles beyond the speed of light?"},{"segment_id":200,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because if they have, then all these questions now become focused, that that means that they would be able to be here, come here and go and if they have, then all of these sightings that we've talked about, all these hundreds of witnesses that we've talked about, then are talking about a very real phenomenon."},{"segment_id":201,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'll close with this one observation, when I was legal counsel for the Iran-Contra investigations, that we were the ones that actually initially discovered the Iran-Contra weapons supply trafficking, and when I delivered this information to Peter Rodino, who was at the time the chair of the Judiciary Committee of the House, through Scott Armstrong, Scott Armstrong, as you'll recall, was the staff person on Rodino's staff of the Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigations, who discovered the taping system in the White House that Alexander Butterfield revealed this to Scott."},{"segment_id":202,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I went and brought this information to him, and because of his close relationship with Peter Rodino, he delivered all of the information we had about the off-the-shelf enterprise, the involvement of Poindexter and everyone else, and the response of Peter Rodino was, he said, \"Scott,\" he said, \"my God,\" he said, \"if what you're telling me is true about this off-the-shelf enterprise going on, delivering these weapons contrary to the orders of Congress, why then,\" he said, \"I've been telling my constituencies that they didn't like the way that American policy was going, that they should write a letter to their congressperson, and if their congressperson didn't do what they wanted them to do, you should vote for someone else for Congress, but if what you're telling me is true, Scott, my God, we haven't even been in control."},{"segment_id":203,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm not going to allow the Congress of the United States to investigate anything like that.\" And that's the issue that's before us now, because if, in fact, we're not in ultimate control, and there is an extraterrestrial intelligence of this type of sophistication that's been visiting our planet and entering our airspace and outmaneuvering our aircraft, it's perfectly clear that from a political consciousness that abides inside our executive branch and inside our legislature, that is not something that they want to share with the American people, because it would ultimately undermine the confidence of the governed in their governors. [applause] My name is Lieutenant Colonel Richard French. I am one of the writers of the original Air"},{"segment_id":204,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Force Blue Book. I was a student at Oregon State starting in 1947, and in my junior year I was asked what specialty I wanted to be assigned when I graduated. An advisor told me about the Office of Special Investigations. It sounded like an exciting and glamorous job, so I volunteered. Brigadier General Carroll, a former FBI director of the Washington District, was commissioned as an Air Force general and assumed command of the OSI."},{"segment_id":205,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The OSI of course was also given the added responsibility of investigating the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects. The OSI assignment required that I have final top secret clearance granted before I could even report for duty. That caused a delay in my reporting because I in fact am adopted and all of my medical and birth records and all that are sealed."},{"segment_id":206,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Every year they straighten out that mess, and I reported to DO-20 at McCord Air Force Base Washington. There my training officer was a special agent named John Drahos. Under his supervision I began investigating UFO reports and recording the incidents in the Air Force's Blue Book."},{"segment_id":207,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The most controversial UFO incident that occurred in my early training deserves special mention because of its unique factor. An F-100D pilot, the Ds, they'd launch them normally just in twos rather than fours like tactical fighters. Anyway, he pulled up on this UFO and it was approximately 30 yards directly behind the thing. The F-86 today carries a total of 36 two and a half inch, or two and a half, let me get this straight, carries 36 of those two and a half inch rockets and they're carried in a pod that drops and it drops and automatically fires when it comes down. Well, he got the clearance to fire which kind of surprised everybody and he blew that UFO out of the sky, but the problem is that the recording of the incident, well, let me get this exactly right, the UFO intercept violated the prohibited zone at Hanford's Atomic Energy Facility. He was a wingman and pulled up straight ahead"},{"segment_id":208,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"and it was given a clearance to fire. When the weapon fired, the pod dropped, but his airplane exploded. They drugged the Colorado River, I mean the Columbia River in a 60 mile area and they never found a piece or part or anything even pertaining to it. I mentioned that I had just a very fast look at the magic report. I hope you people are familiar with it, but if you're not, it is the original report that was prepared. President Truman was the chairman. The people who were on that committee and I just did just get a very quick look at it, but I could easily remember who they were because of who they were. They included the chiefs of the president of course and also the chiefs of staff of all of the armed forces, arms of the United States. In other words, the chief of naval operations and the head of the Coast Guard and on and on. That terminates my presentation."},{"segment_id":209,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have about 10 minutes for each member of the six of you and that will take us to 1250."},{"segment_id":210,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've been asked by both the chair and the co-chair to give time reminders as we're approaching that 10 minute limit for each of you, so I'll do that as gently as possible."},{"segment_id":211,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My understanding is that there will be time cue cards visible to the panelists here and to the members back here. We will watch those and time ourselves. I remember a number of years ago I was traveling in a car and had my car radio on and there were two news accounts."},{"segment_id":212,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One was that there were some UFO sightings over New Mexico and the other was that there had been two mysterious deaths in New York City that might have been cyticosis and if it was cyticosis it might have come from dried pigeon manure, so it was a serious suggestion that maybe we ought to kill all the pigeons in New York. I listened to those two newscasts and I thought, gee, if these flying saucers are extraterrestrial I think I'd wander around a bit up there and watch for a while yet before I landed. As I said when we started this it is really enormously arrogant and presumptive to believe that we're the most advanced civilization in the universe. We still fight stupid wars and kill each other. There just has to be a better way, doesn't there. Again, I will reserve my question until the end. My co-chair."},{"segment_id":213,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I wanted to mention one other thing. All of the time, and there's a period there that's about 12 years, but during that 12-year period my primary job as a member of the OSI was to debunk them. In other words, I'd come up with any kind of explanation. We'd say it was swamp gas or you name it, anything that we could come up with to apparently convince the general public and maintain the secrecy level on that. Some of my answers, I swear, were observed. The swamp gas, for instance, at that time there was an average of about three a week UFOs had descended into the Gulf Breeze, Florida area, if you know where that is. It's just where the panhandle is in Florida. Anyway, I went down there and we observed them just regularly, just sit there every evening with a cocktail and in they'd come."},{"segment_id":214,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But what was it? It was swamp gas. That was my lie and I made good on it. But that was my actual job, to be the most artful lawyer on earth."},{"segment_id":215,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So Colonel French, you did a good job of it, obviously."},{"segment_id":216,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So for all four of you, it's just starting to weigh on me. If transparency would reveal that we really aren't in control, that there are actually as intelligent or more powerful than likely, more intelligent life form than humans, and that in so knowing and admitting would be dangerous, that's a closed circle, folks. So what do you recommend? How do you recommend we handle this? Let's start with the Colonel who won't tell us it's a gas form."},{"segment_id":217,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I see no other way to attack it than to come up with some kind of international organization, something along the line of what we already have in here, or some similar governmental way, and then putting those people, you know, because when you think about it, this confronts religion directly and very firmly. And we do need some type of organization, something that can hold us, if need be, to contact these people from another universe."},{"segment_id":218,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And when they come, you know, it's a lot better if you say, \"Hi, buddy,\" not try and shoot their tail end off."},{"segment_id":219,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So, we're claiming my time to go on to you, Daniel. But let me add a piece to this now."},{"segment_id":220,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Then how will the United States, for one, give up our rights as our national security rights if we went on to cooperate with the United Nations on this?"},{"segment_id":221,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes. This is a worldview issue. One of the things that I discovered after a number of years in practice, the reason I ended up going back to Harvard Divinity School to study after spending a number of years out practicing law, was that this is a worldview issue, that people don't think about this very often, but the reality is there's a spectrum of world views that are shared by our human family, the political manifestation of which, or the political philosophy of which, is you have people who are authoritarians, you have people who are reactionaries, you have people who are conservatives, you have people who are moderates, you have people who are liberals, you have people who are progressives, and then you have people who are basically what we refer to as utopianists, who tend to be theological, for the most part. But there's a whole eighth worldview. There's an octave"},{"segment_id":222,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"of worldviews, and there's a new worldview that is in the offing right now, and that is the worldview that is going to have to be addressed by our human family once we come to acknowledge that there are, in fact, there's a super sophisticated, highly intelligent extraterrestrial civilization, and that there may be more than one of these species."},{"segment_id":223,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, I'm going to reclaim my time because I wanted to know how to break through this."},{"segment_id":224,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's a new worldview. We have to construct the new worldview."},{"segment_id":225,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You're suggesting that we're going to take on a new worldview. If that's what it takes to happen, we're a long way from that. Mr. Juneyos."},{"segment_id":226,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, every so often, things happen in the history of the world that change, that lead to a complete change, and that was the case when America was discovered, and it was called the New World, even though it was part of the same world. But at that time, it completely changed the paradigm of the late medieval period, and there was even discussions whether maybe the Earth paradise was in America, or whether the natives Americans had it sold."},{"segment_id":227,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was a whole kind of huge discussion, and eventually, obviously, we're here, so it worked out. Same thing when the atomic bomb was released, dropped in Japan. That changed the paradigm of that period. I think this is the next frontier, and I don't think it's going to be as difficult as it seems because we're conditioned already by the media and by the entertainment industry."},{"segment_id":228,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Even when I started this business, such as we could call it a business, this beauty, many years ago, the attitude of people was very negative. Really, UFOs were considered like a cookie subject, and now, if you ask a young generation, for them, they say, \"Well, what's the big deal?\" It's obvious that there's life in the universe. I don't know exactly how it will happen, but it will, and we will have to adjust and move forward."},{"segment_id":229,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I guess it's a good thing we have the entertainment industry to turn on people's imaginations."},{"segment_id":230,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Richard?"},{"segment_id":231,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes. Thank you for this question. It's very important. I often think no parent is ever ready for their first child, but they happen anyway. Disclosure of this reality, we may or may not be ready for it. We probably won't be ready for it, frankly. I think that our society is going through such a tremendous revolution. This isn't 1990. It's certainly not 1950. We have capabilities today that I think are forcing this issue out. WikiLeaks didn't exist 10 years ago because it couldn't exist. It wasn't a global infrastructure."},{"segment_id":232,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Cell phone cameras, all of this, this is all new. I think something's going to happen that's going to force this out front and center. My suspicion, I can only guess, is that those people who have knowledge on this, and I think there are such people, must be aware. They must be aware that they cannot keep this secret forever. I think the wisest thing to do would be judiciously and responsibly to begin allowing some of this information out. Maybe there are controlled leaks today. I do think that when this matter is out on the table, that doesn't mean all the answers will be there. It just means that we'll be able, publicly, without all the joking and ridicule, to be able to talk about it as a public policy issue."},{"segment_id":233,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I also think that this will necessitate a geopolitical revolution. You mentioned the issues of U.S. national security. Well, there's other countries in the world, and they're all going to be affected by this. It will have to be necessary for there to be a true United Nations, something that actually works that people can believe in, because without that I think it's just going to be a big mess. Do I have any more time? Two minutes. The next discussion, I would like to go from, we're worried about airspace. How about cyberspace?"},{"segment_id":234,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"May I make the comment at this? Basically, my background is I have more combat than virtually anyone you'll ever meet. I have more than 800 combat missions, 860 in jet fighters, so I'm not afraid of battle. Obviously not. I think the dumbest thing we could possibly do is weaponize space, and I've been in that argument several times, and it would be absurd to do that. Thank you. Thank you. Cyberspace. One minute. It's all we have. It's quite clear that the technology that seems to be at the disposal of this civilization is able to access, if the FBI can tap into your internet, then clearly they can too. So they're monitoring, undoubtedly monitoring all the communications that are going on, and I would dare say that there is a process going on of feathering into our culture, information, technology, et cetera, that is going to soften this blow, that there's a process going on of released"},{"segment_id":235,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"information, of contact information, et cetera, and I find it based on 40 years of doing these kind of investigations of Watergate, Iran-Contra, and others that I've been directly involved in, that there's clearly going to be a decision made by very high level people above all of our pay grades here, I say with all due respect from Congress people, that there'll be a decision made to start feathering information into the culture to prepare our people for this rather gradually, which has been going on now for the last 60 years.

Served on the Appropriations Defense Committee, first African-American woman ever to serve there. It's only been three in the history of our 2,000-year country. It's outrageous. We really believe that women have something to offer. So I really appreciate your service.

I know a lot of it's from the presidential right on down to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of you all spoke to that. We didn't call it by that name, but that's kind of what it was that Truman had, exactly, as a matter of fact. Why is it now that you're at the table discussing it with us, acknowledging that it is?"},{"segment_id":241,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Probably it's because I'm in my 80s now."},{"segment_id":242,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Praise God. Okay."},{"segment_id":243,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Here's the problem. If you had a government job, you had to have, you need to be what they call humanly reliable. In other words, if they thought you were a maniac or something, you'd lose your wings, and lose your job, and so forth. Anyway, I think it's because of that, basically the human reliability problem, the fact that there are some real lunatics in various places, and you can't identify them well enough. Then they won't submit, and you have a problem next to kin. If they have a child that is ill mentally, what do you do?"},{"segment_id":244,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You believe today that, as you sit here with us and former members of Congress, 80 plus years of experience, having now before this committee, whose time has come, since 1968, there's been no hearing, as you know.

I'm afraid for that."},{"segment_id":245,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I heard in this discussion this morning, there's a lot of private things going on. I like to see partnerships, private, public. I think that's when Americans get our best bet, when we come together as a nation in a private, public kind of atmosphere. When you talk about what you just said, and I agree that it's urgent, I think somebody at the table mentioned coming together and acknowledging it, which we haven't done as this country. Other countries are beginning to do that, and some were mentioned this morning. Do you think the Air Force will ever come to that point? Is it a domestic, international partnership that we need?

Mr. Sheehan, you talked about which is worse. That's how you ended that dynamic presentation that you had. Which is worse? Do we try to put this together and save ourselves with the world, or do we continue to put our heads in the sand that it doesn't exist and you know that it does? I'm at a loss.

You've got to be solid."},{"segment_id":248,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's a very difficult issue.

As you know, a significant number of the Congress people are lawyers. They view themselves as representing a certain client base. The problem is that if we represent a nation state, and we insist upon maintaining the special privilege of our citizens, the special access we have to resources in the world, etc., even to the detriment of other nation states, we're still at a level of consciousness that is very dangerous."},{"segment_id":249,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Stop talking too much.

I do agree with Daniel. Probably if the pope and other religious figures, they might be the way to do it. That may do the trick rather than the political will because you know how politics are. You know better than we do how things get very difficult. I see half a minute left. Thank you very much for that.

So you draft that. It doesn't have to be 20 pages. It can be one page, maybe two paragraphs. You draft this so that we can get our hands around something in this regard.

Is there anything out there that document-wise backs up the Roswell incident, that is, the crash and the humanoids? Is there any document that we could put our hands on?"},{"segment_id":284,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, sir. There are a few very interesting documents, even as early as July 1947, FBI, which was involved in investigating the so-called flying saucers very actively, had a memo indicating that the debris or whatever was recovered at Roswell was being transferred to Wright Field Dayton, Ohio, U.S. Air Force headquarters. I think that's rather interesting. Whatever this was, if it was some kind of balloon apparatus, I think we could ask why would that be transferred to Wright Field."},{"segment_id":285,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So that's interesting. There are a number of other documents that talk about rumors within the military discussions of -- Yeah, that's not good enough to -- Right. No, no. -- because it's hearsay."},{"segment_id":286,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But regarding Roswell, there was -- back in 1994, the General Accounting Office of Congress was tasked with looking into the Roswell incident. All right. And this was on the initiative of the late Representative Stephen Schiff of New Mexico, whose constituents asked him to do this, and he did. Schiff talked about this at length, about how the Air Force and the Pentagon just stonewalled him, gave him nothing, gave him a lot of expletives as well in the process. But what the GAO's investigation was that the relevant records at Roswell from the end of 1946 into, I think, 1948, 49 were gone. All of the records that they were looking for, that they expected to find, were, surprise, not there. And there was no explanation given."},{"segment_id":287,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These were records, according to the GAO, that should not have been ever removed. They were permanent, but they were gone. And the Air Force, by the way, was very, very deft in their handling of this, because while the GAO investigation was going on, the United States Air Force took the initiative and did their own study, quote-unquote \"study,\" in which they beat the GAO to the punch in terms of publicity, got their own thing out there and said, oh, yeah, it was a classified balloon project known as Mogul, which was designed to test to see whether the Soviets were detonating their own atomic devices. It's a big, big fat report. It looks very impressive. When you actually read it, it's a load of fluff, in my opinion. But that was their explanation. They beat the GAO to the punch and so they won the PR war."},{"segment_id":288,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you. Mr. Sheehan, would you address, briefly, what is the theological implication?"},{"segment_id":289,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah. Coming to grips with the full import of the theological reality is what undergirds all of this, is that for each of us to recognize that we are incarnated in a material form, but that there are other vibrational frequencies at which there are other dimensions of reality going on at the same time, our theology is the realm in which we deal with it. It's a category of knowledge in the human family in which we deal with other dimensions of reality. What happens after death? How did we get here? What are we doing here? What's our ultimate purpose? These are things that are raised by the UFO issue and that's why I reiterate that it's theology, it's in the realm of theology that we have to come to address this. When we do, what we're going to discover is that we're going to draw down into our culture a lot of those same realities that, for example, the Native American culture"},{"segment_id":290,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"and some of the aboriginal cultures understand that they are in a dynamic relationship with other dimensions, other vibrational frequencies. Our culture has closed itself off from that from the time of the enlightenment in trying to define ourselves as separated, individuated intellectual beings and that we're not in a harmonious, imbalanced relationship with the rest of reality. The consequences, of course, are falling upon us now because of the global climate change that we're experiencing, the contamination of our environment by ourselves."},{"segment_id":291,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is the crisis. I think one of the crises that's going to confront us and that my sense is that we're going to become much more, if we probe into the theology of all of this, we're going to come to have a much more profound appreciation for the Native American culture and the theology of the Native American culture and the faculty of intuitional perception that our human family has, which is a faculty that's evolving teleologically in our culture."},{"segment_id":292,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is what Teilhard de Chardin has dealt with it within the Jesuits. It's the cutting edge of modern theology and the insights that we've gained now through quantum physics since 1923 to 1926.

Another unusual aspect of it was though the metal wasn't any thicker than cellophane, but you put it in your hand and you crush it together and it flops right back into shape.

Well, what happened in the 1960s is that the United States had a big, big wave of UFO sightings, 1965, '66, made the news. Gerald Ford, congressman in Michigan, talked about it on the floor of Congress. His constituents had seen UFOs, and he was not satisfied with the answers that were coming from the Air Force, and the pressure was really on the United States Air Force to do something about this. It's hard to remember because it's so far back in time, but the Air Force was losing a lot of credibility on this. A lot of people were not believing the Air Force explanations, and swamp gas became a big national joke at that time, and so really all the Air Force wanted to do was just get rid of UFOs, and so what they ended up doing was they contracted with the University of Colorado to conduct what was to be the first true public scientific investigation of UFOs, and the whole attitude"},{"segment_id":314,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"was whatever Colorado comes up with, that's what we're going to conclude, and what that study did, that was a whole big mess, and half the scientists got fired midway through the project because they were believers.

don't have to have an adversarial."},{"segment_id":379,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't have to fight the government."},{"segment_id":380,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a mystery."},{"segment_id":381,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We should all work together in order to solve this mystery."},{"segment_id":382,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So that's at least some of what is going on."},{"segment_id":383,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But even Russia has had a lot of official investigations."},{"segment_id":384,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Even under the Soviet Union, there were committees from the -- there were actually two committees that were going on in the late '70s and '80s."},{"segment_id":385,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One was a public one through the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the other one was a secret one by the KGB and the Ministry of Defense, the Soviet military."},{"segment_id":386,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Nobody knew about that one publicly, but the scientific one was even officially revealed even in the controlled Soviet media."},{"segment_id":387,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then, of course, under Gorbachev in the 1980s, Glasnost, it opened up, and the UFO phenomenon became very, very popular in the late Soviet society and into modern Russia."},{"segment_id":388,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So China has had kind of a semi-official organization called the China UFO Research Organization."},{"segment_id":389,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have one of its founding members here also attending this hearing."},{"segment_id":390,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So yes, you see it all over the world, and other countries actually have a more open attitude, I mean, officially."},{"segment_id":391,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So it provides a model also for the U.S., in my opinion."},{"segment_id":392,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For any of the panelists, the other question I have, one of the other questions I have is a lot of people, when they talk about this, at least in this country, are ridiculed when they talk about it."},{"segment_id":393,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is, you know, pooha, you know, you're somewhere in outer space."},{"segment_id":394,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What -- why, I guess?"},{"segment_id":395,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Has there been some organization or is it just our attitudes in the United States tell me why there's so much skepticism in this country?"},{"segment_id":396,"speaker_group":2,"source_text":"I'll try to feel that."},{"segment_id":397,"speaker_group":2,"source_text":"I do find privately people are much more open about this than they are when they're in a public situation."},{"segment_id":398,"speaker_group":2,"source_text":"That's one thing."},{"segment_id":399,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":400,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"People discover that -- probably any of these researchers, and they discover, oh, you research UFOs, inevitably they will say, oh, let me tell you about what I saw last year, five years, 20 years ago."},{"segment_id":401,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"So those stories are out there, and people -- I firmly believe there is a true hunger for knowledge on this once people realize that there's something to it."},{"segment_id":402,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"But I agree with you, in our public discourse, this is a third rail, whether you are in major media or politics or academia, they're all really the same in this regard."},{"segment_id":403,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"I had a professor at UCLA call me a number of years ago, a department chair said, well, I really just want to let you know I enjoy your books."},{"segment_id":404,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"I said, thank you."},{"segment_id":405,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Why are you whispering in the phone?"},{"segment_id":406,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Which literally he was whispering, and he said the typical thing that every professor would say, well, my department is kind of political and not go -- right."},{"segment_id":407,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"So it's always the retired ones who look for me."},{"segment_id":408,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"But personally, I believe, you know, the tone was set back in the '50s."},{"segment_id":409,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"And in fact, the top skeptic debunker in the U.S. at that time was a Harvard astronomer by the name of Donald Menzel."},{"segment_id":410,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Menzel wrote a number of books."},{"segment_id":411,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"He was like the pit bull guard dog maintaining orthodoxy."},{"segment_id":412,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"You know, if some little community college professor was going to get out of line and talk about UFOs, here's Menzel, Harvard astronomer, who's going to argue with Menzel?"},{"segment_id":413,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"And he'd slap them down."},{"segment_id":414,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Menzel, we learned years later, had a very, very close relationship with the National Security Agency, very close."},{"segment_id":415,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Does this prove that the NSA used him in this capacity?"},{"segment_id":416,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Who knows?"},{"segment_id":417,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"But these things -- this is how it looks."},{"segment_id":418,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Back in the late 1970s, journalist Carl Bernstein had the famous Rolling Stone article in which he said there are over 400 U.S. journalists that I have identified who had a covert relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency."},{"segment_id":419,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"CIA promptly said, \"Well, we don't do that anymore.\""},{"segment_id":420,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"And if you read the language carefully in their statements, especially in the 1990s, they're very lawyerly in their denials, it's very clear that there are relationships."},{"segment_id":421,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"So what I am suggesting, and I guess this is the conspiracy angle here, but I would suggest that there are proxies that work with national security elements."},{"segment_id":422,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Look, it's an open revolving door in much of our society anyway."},{"segment_id":423,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Most of this is out in the open, but I think that there are relationships, friendly relationships with academic and with media and political as well, where you have the herders who basically keep the underlings in line."},{"segment_id":424,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"And every now and then someone gets out of line and they have to be dealt with."},{"segment_id":425,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"So I think that that's where the culture is created and it has a top-down effect."},{"segment_id":426,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"And most people, they don't want to be Superman."},{"segment_id":427,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"They have their jobs, they have got their family, they got their things, they can't fight the machine."},{"segment_id":428,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"So they just, they live their lives and hope that someone else takes it on."},{"segment_id":429,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"And there are documents that Mr. Dolan can tell you about, the internal documents in the Air Force and others where they consciously instruct their officers to ridicule and debunk people, is a specific official policy inside the Air Force."},{"segment_id":430,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"People they know positively have seen one of these things to try to destroy their credibility."},{"segment_id":431,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":432,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"In the Robertson panel, which is a famous CIA symposium that took place in January of 1953, in fact, they used the word \"debunk.\""},{"segment_id":433,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"It's in the document itself."},{"segment_id":434,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"As the Colonel says, you know, specifically assigned to go out and ridicule them and tell them they're ridiculous."},{"segment_id":435,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"And most people can't stand up against that kind of thing coming from authority figures."},{"segment_id":436,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":437,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"The Robertson panel was the last act of the Truman administration, it was the last weekend of Harry Truman's presidency that this classified panel took place, and it was specifically related to UFOs."},{"segment_id":438,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Very interesting little historical factoid there."},{"segment_id":439,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"And as Daniel just pointed out, its conclusion was, this is a necessary topic and we must debunk it to the American people."},{"segment_id":440,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"This is not a good thing for them to be thinking about, and they were working with the media to do that."},{"segment_id":441,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":442,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":443,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":444,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Where was the balloon, the Mogul balloon that was supposed to have been the Roswell incident, from where was it supposedly launched?"},{"segment_id":445,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"The Mogul, I thought they were at White Sands, Alamogordo, that area."},{"segment_id":446,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"We have the record, I'm so sorry."},{"segment_id":447,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"From where?"},{"segment_id":448,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"You know what a pie ball is, it's a high-altitude balloon that they track, they launch them and then track them so they can keep track of upper air currents."},{"segment_id":449,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"But when it was launched, when Marcel launched the thing, he would have been probably standing right in front of base ops because that's where they send them up from."},{"segment_id":450,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"From where?"},{"segment_id":451,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Base operations."},{"segment_id":452,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"You see the fighter squadrons or bomber squadrons or whatever they have, their own particular area, but transient airplanes always launch from base operations."},{"segment_id":453,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"How close is one of those to Roswell?"},{"segment_id":454,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"It's on Roswell base."},{"segment_id":455,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"So what they're saying is that the balloon was launched there and crashed there."},{"segment_id":456,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":457,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"I don't know where exactly that it crashed."},{"segment_id":458,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"See, these balloons were supposed to be determining possible Soviet nuclear detonations."},{"segment_id":459,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"I'm just curious where they, because if it was launched somewhere else, the probability that landing at Roswell was vanishingly small."},{"segment_id":460,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"I had a course in advanced statistics and it's vanishingly small probability."},{"segment_id":461,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"The United States Air Force in their 1994 reports said these were launched out of White Sands and actually they had a schedule of a number of these balloon launches that went down and were recovered."},{"segment_id":462,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"So there were several that were from the spring of 1947 and in fact they speculated, this wasn't really a slam dunk, but they indicated that they thought that they'd identified the one launch that was in fact supposedly the Roswell crash and I'm trying to remember the date on that."},{"segment_id":463,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"As has been mentioned, the curious thing about all of this is in the GAO report, there was nothing for them to look at because all of the relevant information had been destroyed."},{"segment_id":464,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"They had no idea at whose command had been destroyed and this is very unorthodox."},{"segment_id":465,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"It should have been there."},{"segment_id":466,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Kind of interesting, isn't it?"},{"segment_id":467,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"I was a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I think it was simply called the Science Committee then."},{"segment_id":468,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"When Schiff held this, I thought it was a hearing apparently, it was a briefing and it was what, about '94 or '95, I came to the Congress in '93 and I remember his interest in that."},{"segment_id":469,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"When I was first approached about this week's activities, I was cautioned that if you do this you could possibly be relegated to the lunatic fringe and this may not be good for your potential activities for the rest of your political productive life."},{"segment_id":470,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"I'm 87 in five weeks, so I don't know how much remains anyhow, but I said, \"I'm going to do this because I think there's a very serious constitutional issue involved here.\""},{"segment_id":471,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Whether there are UFOs or not, whether they are extraterrestrial or not is really quite irrelevant to whether or not there ought to be hearings on this because the First Amendment to the Constitution says, \"The right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\""},{"segment_id":472,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Mr. Sheehan, doesn't this fall within that?"},{"segment_id":473,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Oh yes, there's no doubt about this, but the fact of the matter is in a national security state, from the passage of the National Security Act of 1947, there has been an entire caveat on the Constitution that things that fall under national security, when Oliver North can sit right in front of you and say, \"Sure, I lied to you, the Congress, because this was a covert operation, that we're in charge, you're not in charge.\""},{"segment_id":474,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"There's an entire national security state kind of subculture that believes that they have the right, not only to hold information back from Congress, but to openly defy Congress."},{"segment_id":475,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"When you pass the Boland Amendment, prohibiting them from engaging in the covert operations against Nicaragua, they go ahead and do it anyhow."},{"segment_id":476,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"The danger as a national security state, and if it arose in the context of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, we should move very aggressively at the end of the Cold War to try to disassemble some of those structures of the national security state, not try to create a new one, so that they went searching very quickly for some ultimate other that they had to find, and they ended up having Afghanistan, or Iran, or Iraq."},{"segment_id":477,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"It's a mindset, and it's that whole kind of retrenchment into a defensive position in the face of the ultimate other."},{"segment_id":478,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"It's an ultimate mindset that we have to try to overcome, and as I point out, it's a theological issue because that is a malfunction of our intellect, and it cuts us off from our harmonious relationship not only with the rest of the universe, but all other intelligent species in the universe, and that's what we have to address, I think."},{"segment_id":479,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"It's a worldview issue."},{"segment_id":480,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":481,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"For 20 years in the Congress, I served on the Armed Services Committee, and

original draft, it was military-industrial-congressional complex, and he didn't want to be too political, so he took out the congressional."},{"segment_id":483,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"It's too bad he did that, because this really is a military-industrial-congressional complex."},{"segment_id":484,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"The F-35 is built in 48 states."},{"segment_id":485,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"There are 96 senators, and I don't know how many hundred representatives support the F-35, not because we may need it, but because it
