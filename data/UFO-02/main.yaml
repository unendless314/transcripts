    argued with each other over many aspects of this phenomenon, but one conclusion

    become a central, although covert, but essential component of U.S. history in
    the modern era and indeed of world history.

    a half, let me get this straight, carries 36 of those two and a half inch rockets
    and they're carried in a pod that drops and it drops and automatically fires when
    it comes down. Well, he got the clearance to fire which kind of surprised everybody
    and he blew that UFO out of the sky, but the problem is that the recording of
    the incident, well, let me get this exactly right, the UFO intercept violated

    family, the political manifestation of which, or the political philosophy of which,
    is you have people who are authoritarians, you have people who are reactionaries,
    you have people who are conservatives, you have people who are moderates, you
    have people who are liberals, you have people who are progressives, and then you
    have people who are basically what we refer to as utopianists, who tend to be
    theological, for the most part. But there's a whole eighth worldview. There's
    an octave

    need to be what they call humanly reliable. In other words, if they thought you
    were a maniac or something, you'd lose your wings, and lose your job, and so forth.
    Anyway, I think it's because of that, basically the human reliability problem,
    the fact that there are some real lunatics in various places, and you can't identify
    them well enough. Then they won't submit, and you have a problem next to kin.

    a nation state, and we insist upon maintaining the special privilege of our citizens,

    the GAO's investigation was that the relevant records at Roswell from the end

    study, quote-unquote "study," in which they beat the GAO to the punch in terms
    of publicity, got their own thing out there and said, oh, yeah, it was a classified
    balloon project known as Mogul, which was designed to test to see whether the
    Soviets were detonating their own atomic devices. It's a big, big fat report.
    It looks very impressive. When you actually read it, it's a load of fluff, in

    relationship with other dimensions, other vibrational frequencies. Our culture
    has closed itself off from that from the time of the enlightenment in trying to
    define ourselves as separated, individuated intellectual beings and that we're
    not in a harmonious, imbalanced relationship with the rest of reality. The consequences,
    of course, are falling upon us now because of the global climate change that we're
    experiencing, the contamination of our environment by ourselves.

    appreciation for the Native American culture and the theology of the Native American

    It's the cutting edge of modern theology and the insights that we've gained now

    worldview the insights of quantum physics and we have to begin to readjust our
