  source_text: I just want to point out that researchers of UFO phenomenon have long argued with each other over many aspects
    of this phenomenon, but one conclusion that I think all of us share, at least serious research, is that the UFOs have
    become a central, although covert, but essential component of U.S. history in the modern era and indeed of world history.

    extraterrestrial civilizations within our own galaxy.

    he said, "I've been telling my constituencies that they didn't like the way that American policy was going, that they

    should vote for someone else for Congress, but if what you're telling me is true, Scott, my God, we haven't even been

    its unique factor. An F-100D pilot, the Ds, they'd launch them normally just in twos rather than fours like tactical fighters.
    Anyway, he pulled up on this UFO and it was approximately 30 yards directly behind the thing. The F-86 today carries a
    total of 36 two and a half inch, or two and a half, let me get this straight, carries 36 of those two and a half inch
    rockets and they're carried in a pod that drops and it drops and automatically fires when it comes down. Well, he got
    the clearance to fire which kind of surprised everybody and he blew that UFO out of the sky, but the problem is that the
    recording of the incident, well, let me get this exactly right, the UFO intercept violated the prohibited zone at Hanford's
    Atomic Energy Facility. He was a wingman and pulled up straight ahead

    who were on that committee and I just did just get a very quick look at it, but I could easily remember who they were
    because of who they were. They included the chiefs of the president of course and also the chiefs of staff of all of the
    armed forces, arms of the United States. In other words, the chief of naval operations and the head of the Coast Guard
    and on and on. That terminates my presentation.

    any kind of explanation. We'd say it was swamp gas or you name it, anything that we could come up with to apparently convince
    the general public and maintain the secrecy level on that. Some of my answers, I swear, were observed. The swamp gas,
    for instance, at that time there was an average of about three a week UFOs had descended into the Gulf Breeze, Florida
    area, if you know where that is. It's just where the panhandle is in Florida. Anyway, I went down there and we observed

    and that was the case when America was discovered, and it was called the New World, even though it was part of the same
    world. But at that time, it completely changed the paradigm of the late medieval period, and there was even discussions
    whether maybe the Earth paradise was in America, or whether the natives Americans had it sold.

    not 1950. We have capabilities today that I think are forcing this issue out. WikiLeaks didn't exist 10 years ago because
    it couldn't exist. It wasn't a global infrastructure.

    there are such people, must be aware. They must be aware that they cannot keep this secret forever. I think the wisest
    thing to do would be judiciously and responsibly to begin allowing some of this information out. Maybe there are controlled
    leaks today. I do think that when this matter is out on the table, that doesn't mean all the answers will be there. It
    just means that we'll be able, publicly, without all the joking and ridicule, to be able to talk about it as a public
    policy issue.

    in various places, and you can't identify them well enough. Then they won't submit, and you have a problem next to kin.

    kind of atmosphere. When you talk about what you just said, and I agree that it's urgent, I think somebody at the table
    mentioned coming together and acknowledging it, which we haven't done as this country. Other countries are beginning to
    do that, and some were mentioned this morning. Do you think the Air Force will ever come to that point? Is it a domestic,
    international partnership that we need? How would you begin it? You come with the credibility.

  source_text: It's a very difficult issue. Because of the job assignments, when a person is a congressional representative,
    for example, and has the duty of representing her or his congressional district in the interests that are there, it's
    a job. As you know, a significant number of the Congress people are lawyers. They view themselves as representing a certain
    client base. The problem is that if we represent a nation state, and we insist upon maintaining the special privilege
    of our citizens, the special access we have to resources in the world, etc., even to the detriment of other nation states,
    we're still at a level of consciousness that is very dangerous.

    you know how politics are. You know better than we do how things get very difficult. I see half a minute left. Thank you

    investigating the so-called flying saucers very actively, had a memo indicating that the debris or whatever was recovered
    at Roswell was being transferred to Wright Field Dayton, Ohio, U.S. Air Force headquarters. I think that's rather interesting.
    Whatever this was, if it was some kind of balloon apparatus, I think we could ask why would that be transferred to Wright
    Field.

    looking into the Roswell incident. All right. And this was on the initiative of the late Representative Stephen Schiff
    of New Mexico, whose constituents asked him to do this, and he did. Schiff talked about this at length, about how the
    Air Force and the Pentagon just stonewalled him, gave him nothing, gave him a lot of expletives as well in the process.
    But what the GAO's investigation was that the relevant records at Roswell from the end of 1946 into, I think, 1948, 49
    were gone. All of the records that they were looking for, that they expected to find, were, surprise, not there. And there
    was no explanation given.

  source_text: These were records, according to the GAO, that should not have been ever removed. They were permanent, but
    they were gone. And the Air Force, by the way, was very, very deft in their handling of this, because while the GAO investigation
    was going on, the United States Air Force took the initiative and did their own study, quote-unquote "study," in which
    they beat the GAO to the punch in terms of publicity, got their own thing out there and said, oh, yeah, it was a classified
    balloon project known as Mogul, which was designed to test to see whether the Soviets were detonating their own atomic
    devices. It's a big, big fat report. It looks very impressive. When you actually read it, it's a load of fluff, in my
    opinion. But that was their explanation. They beat the GAO to the punch and so they won the PR war.

  source_text: Yeah. Coming to grips with the full import of the theological reality is what undergirds all of this, is that
    for each of us to recognize that we are incarnated in a material form, but that there are other vibrational frequencies
    at which there are other dimensions of reality going on at the same time, our theology is the realm in which we deal with
    it. It's a category of knowledge in the human family in which we deal with other dimensions of reality. What happens after
    death? How did we get here? What are we doing here? What's our ultimate purpose? These are things that are raised by the
    UFO issue and that's why I reiterate that it's theology, it's in the realm of theology that we have to come to address
    this. When we do, what we're going to discover is that we're going to draw down into our culture a lot of those same realities
    that, for example, the Native American culture

    with the rest of reality. The consequences, of course, are falling upon us now because of the global climate change that
    we're experiencing, the contamination of our environment by ourselves.

    of the accident at Alamogordo. All of that was taken to what is called the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson
    Air Force Base. What was shipped, there was physical debris, actually parts of some kind of airplane. Another unusual
    aspect of it was though the metal wasn't any thicker than cellophane, but you put it in your hand and you crush it together
    and it flops right back into shape. Had it analyzed, it didn't come from Earth. There's no known, we have no known source
    of whatever that metal was.

    1965, '66, made the news. Gerald Ford, congressman in Michigan, talked about it on the floor of Congress. His constituents
    had seen UFOs, and he was not satisfied with the answers that were coming from the Air Force, and the pressure was really
    on the United States Air Force to do something about this. It's hard to remember because it's so far back in time, but
    the Air Force was losing a lot of credibility on this. A lot of people were not believing the Air Force explanations,
    and swamp gas became a big national joke at that time, and so really all the Air Force wanted to do was just get rid of
    UFOs, and so what they ended up doing was they contracted with the University of Colorado to conduct what was to be the
    first true public scientific investigation of UFOs, and the whole attitude

    in closing Blue Book down in 1969, that UFO reports affecting national security were not part of the Blue Book system,
