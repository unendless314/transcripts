      as July 1947, FBI, which was involved in investigating the so-called flying
      saucers very actively, had a memo indicating that the debris or whatever was
      recovered at Roswell was being transferred to Wright Field Dayton, Ohio, U.S.
      Air Force headquarters. I think that's rather interesting. Whatever this was,
      if it was some kind of balloon apparatus, I think we could ask why would that
      be transferred to Wright Field.

      investigation was going on, the United States Air Force took the initiative
      and did their own study, quote-unquote "study," in which they beat the GAO to
      the punch in terms of publicity, got their own thing out there and said, oh,
      yeah, it was a classified balloon project known as Mogul, which was designed
      to test to see whether the Soviets were detonating their own atomic devices.
      It's a big, big fat report. It looks very impressive. When you actually read

      theology is the realm in which we deal with it. It's a category of knowledge

      happens after death? How did we get here? What are we doing here? What's our

      Ford, congressman in Michigan, talked about it on the floor of Congress. His
      constituents had seen UFOs, and he was not satisfied with the answers that were
      coming from the Air Force, and the pressure was really on the United States
      Air Force to do something about this. It's hard to remember because it's so
      far back in time, but the Air Force was losing a lot of credibility on this.
      A lot of people were not believing the Air Force explanations, and swamp gas
      became a big national joke at that time, and so really all the Air Force wanted
      to do was just get rid of UFOs, and so what they ended up doing was they contracted
      with the University of Colorado to conduct what was to be the first true public
      scientific investigation of UFOs, and the whole attitude

      it, Edward Condon, was absolutely dead set against any kind of pro-UFO, pro-ET.

    source_text: The end of 1969. Well, what happened in the 1960s is that the United
      States had a big, big wave of UFO sightings, 1965, '66, made the news. Gerald
      Ford, congressman in Michigan, talked about it on the floor of Congress. His
      constituents had seen UFOs, and he was not satisfied with the answers that were
      coming from the Air Force, and the pressure was really on the United States
      Air Force to do something about this. It's hard to remember because it's so
      far back in time, but the Air Force was losing a lot of credibility on this.
      A lot of people were not believing the Air Force explanations, and swamp gas
      became a big national joke at that time, and so really all the Air Force wanted
      to do was just get rid of UFOs, and so what they ended up doing was they contracted
      with the University of Colorado to conduct what was to be the first true public
      scientific investigation of UFOs, and the whole attitude

      a period there that's about 12 years, but during that 12-year period my primary
      job as a member of the OSI was to debunk them. In other words, I'd come up with
      any kind of explanation. We'd say it was swamp gas or you name it, anything
      that we could come up with to apparently convince the general public and maintain
      the secrecy level on that. Some of my answers, I swear, were observed. The swamp
      gas, for instance, at that time there was an average of about three a week UFOs

      using the Grenada precedent and already the numbers, the resolutions that have

      public officials, as private citizens, to put our money where our mouth is,
      and that is to be globalists before we become nationalists. And that's the answer.

      Office of Congress was tasked with looking into the Roswell incident. All right.
      And this was on the initiative of the late Representative Stephen Schiff of
      New Mexico, whose constituents asked him to do this, and he did. Schiff talked
      about this at length, about how the Air Force and the Pentagon just stonewalled
      him, gave him nothing, gave him a lot of expletives as well in the process.
      But what the GAO's investigation was that the relevant records at Roswell from
      the end of 1946 into, I think, 1948, 49 were gone. All of the records that they
      were looking for, that they expected to find, were, surprise, not there. And
      there was no explanation given.

      Air Force Base. What was shipped, there was physical debris, actually parts
      of some kind of airplane. Another unusual aspect of it was though the metal
      wasn't any thicker than cellophane, but you put it in your hand and you crush
      it together and it flops right back into shape. Had it analyzed, it didn't come
      from Earth. There's no known, we have no known source of whatever that metal
