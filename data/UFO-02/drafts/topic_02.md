## Speaker Group 1

209. We have about 10 minutes for each member of the six of you and that will take us to 1250.
→ {"text": "我們六位成員每人約有 10 分鐘時間，這將帶我們到 12 點 50 分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. I've been asked by both the chair and the co-chair to give time reminders as we're approaching that 10 minute limit for each of you, so I'll do that as gently as possible.
→ {"text": "主席與副主席都要求我在接近各位的 10 分鐘限制時提醒時間，所以我會盡可能溫和地提醒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. My understanding is that there will be time cue cards visible to the panelists here and to the members back here. We will watch those and time ourselves. I remember a number of years ago I was traveling in a car and had my car radio on and there were two news accounts.
→ {"text": "我的理解是這裡的小組成員與後面的委員會成員都能看到時間提示卡。我們會注意那些卡片並自己計時。我記得多年前我在車上旅行，打開車上的收音機，聽到兩則新聞報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. One was that there were some UFO sightings over New Mexico and the other was that there had been two mysterious deaths in New York City that might have been cyticosis and if it was cyticosis it might have come from dried pigeon manure, so it was a serious suggestion that maybe we ought to kill all the pigeons in New York. I listened to those two newscasts and I thought, gee, if these flying saucers are extraterrestrial I think I'd wander around a bit up there and watch for a while yet before I landed. As I said when we started this it is really enormously arrogant and presumptive to believe that we're the most advanced civilization in the universe. We still fight stupid wars and kill each other. There just has to be a better way, doesn't there. Again, I will reserve my question until the end. My co-chair.
→ {"text": "一則是新墨西哥州上空有不明飛行物目擊事件，另一則是紐約市有兩起神秘死亡事件，可能是鸚鵡熱，如果是鸚鵡熱，可能來自乾燥的鴿子糞便，所以有人認真建議也許我們應該殺死紐約所有的鴿子。我聽著這兩則新聞播報，心想，天啊，如果這些飛碟是外星的，我想我會在上面多轉轉，再觀察一陣子才降落。正如我在開始時所說的，相信我們是宇宙中最先進的文明，實在是極度傲慢與自以為是。我們仍在進行愚蠢的戰爭並互相殘殺。一定有更好的方式，不是嗎。我會再次將我的問題保留到最後。我的副主席。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. I wanted to mention one other thing. All of the time, and there's a period there that's about 12 years, but during that 12-year period my primary job as a member of the OSI was to debunk them. In other words, I'd come up with any kind of explanation. We'd say it was swamp gas or you name it, anything that we could come up with to apparently convince the general public and maintain the secrecy level on that. Some of my answers, I swear, were observed. The swamp gas, for instance, at that time there was an average of about three a week UFOs had descended into the Gulf Breeze, Florida area, if you know where that is. It's just where the panhandle is in Florida. Anyway, I went down there and we observed them just regularly, just sit there every evening with a cocktail and in they'd come.
→ {"text": "我想提另一件事。一直以來，那段時期大約有 12 年，但在那 12 年期間，我作為 OSI 成員的主要工作就是揭穿它們。換句話說，我會想出任何解釋。我們會說那是沼氣或你說什麼都行，任何我們能想到的東西，顯然是為了說服一般大眾並維持保密層級。我發誓，我的一些答案真的很荒謬。例如沼氣，當時佛羅里達州海灣微風地區平均每週有大約三次不明飛行物降落，如果你知道那裡在哪的話。就是佛羅里達州狹長地帶那裡。無論如何，我去了那裡，我們定期觀察它們，每天晚上就坐在那裡喝著雞尾酒，它們就進來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. But what was it? It was swamp gas. That was my lie and I made good on it. But that was my actual job, to be the most artful lawyer on earth.
→ {"text": "但那是什麼？那是沼氣。那是我的謊言，而且我說得很好。但那就是我的實際工作，成為地球上最狡猾的律師。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. So Colonel French, you did a good job of it, obviously.
→ {"text": "所以法蘭奇中校，你顯然做得很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. So for all four of you, it's just starting to weigh on me. If transparency would reveal that we really aren't in control, that there are actually as intelligent or more powerful than likely, more intelligent life form than humans, and that in so knowing and admitting would be dangerous, that's a closed circle, folks. So what do you recommend? How do you recommend we handle this? Let's start with the Colonel who won't tell us it's a gas form.
→ {"text": "所以對你們四位，這件事開始讓我感到沉重。如果透明化會揭示我們實際上沒有控制權，實際上有與人類一樣聰明或很可能更強大、更聰明的生命形式存在，而且知道並承認這一點會很危險，這是個封閉的循環，各位。那麼你們有什麼建議？你們建議我們如何處理這件事？讓我們從不會告訴我們那是氣體形式的中校開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. Well, I see no other way to attack it than to come up with some kind of international organization, something along the line of what we already have in here, or some similar governmental way, and then putting those people, you know, because when you think about it, this confronts religion directly and very firmly. And we do need some type of organization, something that can hold us, if need be, to contact these people from another universe.
→ {"text": "嗯，我認為除了建立某種國際組織，沒有其他方法來應對它，類似於我們這裡已經有的組織，或某種類似的政府方式，然後讓那些人參與，你知道，因為仔細想想，這直接且堅定地挑戰了宗教。我們確實需要某種組織，在必要時可以支持我們與這些來自另一個宇宙的人接觸的組織。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. And when they come, you know, it's a lot better if you say, "Hi, buddy," not try and shoot their tail end off.
→ {"text": "當他們來的時候，你知道，說「嗨，朋友」會比試圖把他們的尾巴打掉要好得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. So, we're claiming my time to go on to you, Daniel. But let me add a piece to this now.
→ {"text": "所以，我要利用我的時間來請教你，丹尼爾。但讓我現在補充一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. Then how will the United States, for one, give up our rights as our national security rights if we went on to cooperate with the United Nations on this?
→ {"text": "那麼，以美國為例，如果我們繼續在這件事上與聯合國合作，我們如何能夠放棄我們的國家安全權利？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. Yes. This is a worldview issue. One of the things that I discovered after a number of years in practice, the reason I ended up going back to Harvard Divinity School to study after spending a number of years out practicing law, was that this is a worldview issue, that people don't think about this very often, but the reality is there's a spectrum of world views that are shared by our human family, the political manifestation of which, or the political philosophy of which, is you have people who are authoritarians, you have people who are reactionaries, you have people who are conservatives, you have people who are moderates, you have people who are liberals, you have people who are progressives, and then you have people who are basically what we refer to as utopianists, who tend to be theological, for the most part. But there's a whole eighth worldview. There's an octave
→ {"text": "是的。這是一個世界觀的問題。我在執業多年後發現的其中一件事，也是我在從事法律工作多年後最終回到哈佛神學院學習的原因，就是這是一個世界觀的問題。人們不常思考這個問題，但現實是我們人類有一系列的世界觀，其政治表現或政治哲學是，有些人是威權主義者，有些人是反動派，有些人是保守派，有些人是溫和派，有些人是自由派，有些人是進步派，還有些人基本上是我們所稱的烏托邦主義者，他們大多傾向於神學。但還有第八種世界觀。有一個八度音階。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. of worldviews, and there's a new worldview that is in the offing right now, and that is the worldview that is going to have to be addressed by our human family once we come to acknowledge that there are, in fact, there's a super sophisticated, highly intelligent extraterrestrial civilization, and that there may be more than one of these species.
→ {"text": "世界觀的八度音階，而現在正在醞釀一個新的世界觀，這個世界觀將必須由我們人類來面對，一旦我們承認事實上存在著一個超級精密、高度智慧的外星文明，而且可能不只一個這樣的物種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. Okay, I'm going to reclaim my time because I wanted to know how to break through this.
→ {"text": "好的，我要收回我的時間，因為我想知道如何突破這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. It's a new worldview. We have to construct the new worldview.
→ {"text": "這是一個新的世界觀。我們必須建構這個新的世界觀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. You're suggesting that we're going to take on a new worldview. If that's what it takes to happen, we're a long way from that. Mr. Juneyos.
→ {"text": "你的意思是我們將採納一個新的世界觀。如果這是必要的，我們離那個目標還很遠。胡尼烏斯先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Juneyos 是 Antonio Huneeus 的錯誤發音，依據 terminology.yaml 譯為「胡尼烏斯」"}

226. Well, every so often, things happen in the history of the world that change, that lead to a complete change, and that was the case when America was discovered, and it was called the New World, even though it was part of the same world. But at that time, it completely changed the paradigm of the late medieval period, and there was even discussions whether maybe the Earth paradise was in America, or whether the natives Americans had it sold.
→ {"text": "嗯，在世界歷史上，每隔一段時間就會發生導致徹底改變的事情，當美洲被發現時就是這樣，它被稱為新世界，儘管它是同一個世界的一部分。但在當時，它徹底改變了中世紀晚期的典範，甚至有關於地球上的天堂是否在美洲，或者美洲原住民是否有靈魂的討論。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "had it sold 疑似為 had a soul 的聽寫錯誤，依據上下文譯為「有靈魂」"}

227. It was a whole kind of huge discussion, and eventually, obviously, we're here, so it worked out. Same thing when the atomic bomb was released, dropped in Japan. That changed the paradigm of that period. I think this is the next frontier, and I don't think it's going to be as difficult as it seems because we're conditioned already by the media and by the entertainment industry.
→ {"text": "這是一場巨大的討論，最終，顯然，我們都在這裡，所以結果是好的。當原子彈投擲在日本時也是同樣的情況。那改變了那個時期的典範。我認為這是下一個前沿，而且我不認為它會像看起來那麼困難，因為我們已經被媒體和娛樂產業所調適了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. Even when I started this business, such as we could call it a business, this beauty, many years ago, the attitude of people was very negative. Really, UFOs were considered like a cookie subject, and now, if you ask a young generation, for them, they say, "Well, what's the big deal?" It's obvious that there's life in the universe. I don't know exactly how it will happen, but it will, and we will have to adjust and move forward.
→ {"text": "即使在我多年前開始這項工作時，如果我們可以稱之為工作的話，這個領域，人們的態度非常負面。真的，不明飛行物被視為荒誕不經的主題，而現在，如果你問年輕一代，對他們來說，他們會說：「嗯，有什麼大不了的？」宇宙中顯然存在生命。我不確切知道它將如何發生，但它會發生，而我們將必須調整並向前邁進。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "cookie subject 疑似為 kooky subject（怪異主題）的聽寫錯誤"}

229. I guess it's a good thing we have the entertainment industry to turn on people's imaginations.
→ {"text": "我想我們有娛樂產業來啟發人們的想像力是件好事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. Richard?
→ {"text": "理查德？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. Yes. Thank you for this question. It's very important. I often think no parent is ever ready for their first child, but they happen anyway. Disclosure of this reality, we may or may not be ready for it. We probably won't be ready for it, frankly. I think that our society is going through such a tremendous revolution. This isn't 1990. It's certainly not 1950. We have capabilities today that I think are forcing this issue out. WikiLeaks didn't exist 10 years ago because it couldn't exist. It wasn't a global infrastructure.
→ {"text": "是的。謝謝你提出這個問題。這非常重要。我常常想，沒有父母真正準備好迎接他們的第一個孩子，但無論如何都會發生。這個真相的揭露，我們可能準備好了，也可能沒有。坦白說，我們可能不會準備好。我認為我們的社會正在經歷如此巨大的革命。這不是 1990 年。當然也不是 1950 年。我認為我們今天擁有的能力正在迫使這個問題浮出水面。維基解密在 10 年前不存在，因為它不可能存在。當時沒有全球基礎設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. Cell phone cameras, all of this, this is all new. I think something's going to happen that's going to force this out front and center. My suspicion, I can only guess, is that those people who have knowledge on this, and I think there are such people, must be aware. They must be aware that they cannot keep this secret forever. I think the wisest thing to do would be judiciously and responsibly to begin allowing some of this information out. Maybe there are controlled leaks today. I do think that when this matter is out on the table, that doesn't mean all the answers will be there. It just means that we'll be able, publicly, without all the joking and ridicule, to be able to talk about it as a public policy issue.
→ {"text": "手機相機，所有這些，這些都是新的。我認為將會發生某些事情，迫使這個問題浮上檯面並成為焦點。我的懷疑，我只能猜測，是那些對此有所了解的人，我認為確實有這樣的人，他們一定知道。他們一定知道無法永遠保守這個秘密。我認為最明智的做法是明智而負責任地開始允許部分資訊公開。也許今天已經有受控的洩密。我確實認為，當這件事擺上檯面時，並不意味著所有答案都會在那裡。這只是意味著我們將能夠公開地，不再有所有的嘲笑和嘲諷，能夠將其作為公共政策議題來討論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. I also think that this will necessitate a geopolitical revolution. You mentioned the issues of U.S. national security. Well, there's other countries in the world, and they're all going to be affected by this. It will have to be necessary for there to be a true United Nations, something that actually works that people can believe in, because without that I think it's just going to be a big mess. Do I have any more time? Two minutes. The next discussion, I would like to go from, we're worried about airspace. How about cyberspace?
→ {"text": "我也認為這將需要一場地緣政治革命。你提到了美國國家安全的問題。嗯，世界上還有其他國家，他們都將受到影響。必須要有一個真正的聯合國，一個真正有效且人們可以信賴的組織，因為沒有那個，我認為這將只會是一團混亂。我還有時間嗎？兩分鐘。下一個討論，我想從——我們擔心領空問題。那麼網路空間呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. May I make the comment at this? Basically, my background is I have more combat than virtually anyone you'll ever meet. I have more than 800 combat missions, 860 in jet fighters, so I'm not afraid of battle. Obviously not. I think the dumbest thing we could possibly do is weaponize space, and I've been in that argument several times, and it would be absurd to do that. Thank you. Thank you. Cyberspace. One minute. It's all we have. It's quite clear that the technology that seems to be at the disposal of this civilization is able to access, if the FBI can tap into your internet, then clearly they can too. So they're monitoring, undoubtedly monitoring all the communications that are going on, and I would dare say that there is a process going on of feathering into our culture, information, technology, et cetera, that is going to soften this blow, that there's a process going on of released
→ {"text": "我可以對此發表評論嗎？基本上，我的背景是我比你將遇到的幾乎任何人都有更多的戰鬥經驗。我執行過超過 800 次戰鬥任務，其中 860 次是駕駛噴射戰鬥機，所以我不怕戰鬥。顯然不怕。我認為我們可能做的最愚蠢的事情就是將太空武器化，我多次參與過那個爭論，那樣做將是荒謬的。謝謝。謝謝。網路空間。一分鐘。這就是我們所有的時間。很明顯，這個文明似乎可以使用的技術能夠存取，如果聯邦調查局可以監聽你的網路，那麼顯然他們也可以。所以他們正在監控，毫無疑問地監控所有正在進行的通訊，而且我敢說，有一個過程正在進行，將資訊、技術等逐步滲入我們的文化，這將緩和這個衝擊，有一個釋放的過程正在進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. information, of contact information, et cetera, and I find it based on 40 years of doing these kind of investigations of Watergate, Iran-Contra, and others that I've been directly involved in, that there's clearly going to be a decision made by very high level people above all of our pay grades here, I say with all due respect from Congress people, that there'll be a decision made to start feathering information into the culture to prepare our people for this rather gradually, which has been going on now for the last 60 years. I think we're finished.
→ {"text": "資訊、接觸資訊等等，而且根據我 40 年來進行這類調查的經驗，包括水門事件、伊朗門事件以及其他我直接參與的案件，我發現，顯然會有一個決定，由非常高層的人做出，遠超過我們在座所有人的級別，我對國會議員們致以所有應有的尊重，將會有一個決定，開始將資訊逐步滲入文化中，相當漸進地為我們的人民做準備，這在過去 60 年中一直在進行。我想我們說完了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. Congresswoman Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "基爾派翠克眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. Thank you very much. I think I want to start with the Colonel. I served on the Air Force Academy Board for about six years in my 12-year tenure, 14 years in Congress. Served on the Appropriations Defense Committee, first African-American woman ever to serve there. It's only been three in the history of our 2,000-year country. It's outrageous. We really believe that women have something to offer. So I really appreciate your service. We come from a "let's work this out" kind of thing, so we wouldn't have this problem when we control the world. But having said that, Colonel, I really appreciate your service, your time, your dedication. 800-plus.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。我想我要從中校開始。我在空軍官校董事會服務了大約六年，在我 12 年的任期中，在國會任職 14 年。在撥款國防委員會任職，是第一位在那裡任職的非裔美國女性。在我們國家 200 年的歷史中只有三位。這太離譜了。我們真的相信女性有所貢獻。所以我真的很感謝你的服務。我們來自一種「讓我們解決問題」的態度，所以當我們掌控世界時就不會有這個問題了。但話雖如此，中校，我真的很感謝你的服務、你的時間、你的奉獻。超過 800 次任務。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "2,000-year country 應為 200-year country 的聽寫錯誤"}

239. I've been all over the world with the Defense Department, and it's been quite an experience for me. It's really capitalized and captured my tenure in Congress, really. Why is it that when you were there, you couldn't talk about it? Everything I've read and seen, everybody hush-hushed it.
→ {"text": "我隨國防部去過世界各地，這對我來說是相當寶貴的經驗。這真的是我在國會任期的精華與重點。為什麼當你在那裡時，你不能談論它？我讀過和看過的一切，每個人都對此保持緘默。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. Wait, let me do it. I want you to do the whole question. The whole question. I know a lot of it's from the presidential right on down to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of you all spoke to that. We didn't call it by that name, but that's kind of what it was that Truman had, exactly, as a matter of fact. Why is it now that you're at the table discussing it with us, acknowledging that it is?
→ {"text": "等等，讓我來問。我要你回答完整的問題。完整的問題。我知道很多事情是從總統一直到參謀長聯席會議。你們其中一位提到過那個。我們當時不這樣稱呼它，但事實上，那正是杜魯門所擁有的。為什麼現在你坐在這裡與我們討論它，承認它的存在？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. Probably it's because I'm in my 80s now.
→ {"text": "可能是因為我現在已經 80 多歲了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. Praise God. Okay.
→ {"text": "感謝上帝。好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. Here's the problem. If you had a government job, you had to have, you need to be what they call humanly reliable. In other words, if they thought you were a maniac or something, you'd lose your wings, and lose your job, and so forth. Anyway, I think it's because of that, basically the human reliability problem, the fact that there are some real lunatics in various places, and you can't identify them well enough. Then they won't submit, and you have a problem next to kin. If they have a child that is ill mentally, what do you do?
→ {"text": "問題在這裡。如果你有政府工作，你必須具備他們所謂的人員可靠性。換句話說，如果他們認為你是個瘋子或什麼的，你會失去飛行資格、失去工作等等。無論如何，我認為就是因為這個，基本上是人員可靠性的問題，事實是各處確實有一些真正的瘋子，而你無法充分識別他們。然後他們不會順從，而且你還有近親的問題。如果他們有一個精神不健全的孩子，你該怎麼辦？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. You believe today that, as you sit here with us and former members of Congress, 80 plus years of experience, having now before this committee, whose time has come, since 1968, there's been no hearing, as you know. We're moving to that. I don't know that the answer is another hearing right now. I'm afraid for that.
→ {"text": "你今天相信，當你與我們以及前國會議員坐在這裡，擁有超過 80 年的經驗，現在在這個時機已到的委員會面前，自 1968 年以來就沒有聽證會了，如你所知。我們正朝那個方向前進。我不確定答案是否現在就舉行另一場聽證會。我對此感到擔憂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. I heard in this discussion this morning, there's a lot of private things going on. I like to see partnerships, private, public. I think that's when Americans get our best bet, when we come together as a nation in a private, public kind of atmosphere. When you talk about what you just said, and I agree that it's urgent, I think somebody at the table mentioned coming together and acknowledging it, which we haven't done as this country. Other countries are beginning to do that, and some were mentioned this morning. Do you think the Air Force will ever come to that point? Is it a domestic, international partnership that we need? How would you begin it? You come with the credibility.
→ {"text": "我在今天早上的討論中聽到，有很多私人進行的事情。我希望看到公私合作夥伴關係。我認為當我們作為一個國家在公私合作的氛圍中團結起來時，美國人會得到最好的結果。當你談論你剛才所說的，我同意這很緊迫，我想在座的某人提到團結起來並承認它，這是我們國家尚未做到的。其他國家已經開始這樣做，今天早上提到了一些。你認為空軍會達到那個地步嗎？我們需要的是國內還是國際合作夥伴關係？你會如何開始？你帶來了可信度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. It's necessary, and I don't think we've got much choice. Something's got to be done.
→ {"text": "這是必要的，而且我認為我們沒有太多選擇。必須採取一些行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. You all have to help us formulate that, too. I agree with that. Thank you very much for your service. Mr. Sheehan, you talked about which is worse. That's how you ended that dynamic presentation that you had. Which is worse? Do we try to put this together and save ourselves with the world, or do we continue to put our heads in the sand that it doesn't exist and you know that it does? I'm at a loss. You all are giving us good information, and I think those in the audience want us to come up with some kind of recommendation, and I can't have it both ways. You've got to be solid.
→ {"text": "你們也必須幫助我們制定那個方案。我同意這一點。非常感謝你的服務。希恩先生，你談到哪個更糟。那是你結束那場精彩陳述的方式。哪個更糟？我們是嘗試將這件事整合起來並與世界一起拯救自己，還是繼續把頭埋在沙子裡，假裝它不存在，而你知道它確實存在？我感到困惑。你們都給了我們很好的資訊，我認為觀眾中的人希望我們提出某種建議，而我不能兩者兼顧。你必須立場堅定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. It's a very difficult issue. Because of the job assignments, when a person is a congressional representative, for example, and has the duty of representing her or his congressional district in the interests that are there, it's a job. As you know, a significant number of the Congress people are lawyers. They view themselves as representing a certain client base. The problem is that if we represent a nation state, and we insist upon maintaining the special privilege of our citizens, the special access we have to resources in the world, etc., even to the detriment of other nation states, we're still at a level of consciousness that is very dangerous.
→ {"text": "這是一個非常困難的問題。由於工作分配，當一個人是國會代表時，例如，有責任代表她或他的國會選區及其利益，這是一份工作。如你所知，相當多的國會議員是律師。他們將自己視為代表某個客戶群。問題在於，如果我們代表一個民族國家，並堅持維護我們公民的特殊特權、我們對世界資源的特殊獲取權等等，即使對其他民族國家有害，我們仍處於一個非常危險的意識層次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. Stop talking too much. Break it down for me. You've got to give me two, three points. We don't have a lot of time. I love everything you said, but don't give it to me back yet.
→ {"text": "別說太多了。給我簡化一下。你必須給我兩三個要點。我們沒有很多時間。我喜歡你說的一切，但先別給我回覆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. You've got to have something to hold onto. We're going to have to yield some of our national sovereignty to a global body like the United Nations.
→ {"text": "你必須有個依據。我們將必須向聯合國這樣的全球機構讓渡部分國家主權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. Right there. We're not doing that. We've got leadership presidents now who don't even acknowledge that it exists, so we're not going to yield anything. It's got to be approached to that.
→ {"text": "就是這個。我們不會這樣做。我們現在的領導層總統甚至不承認它的存在，所以我們不會讓渡任何東西。必須用不同的方式處理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. Maybe we do it better because we're former elected officials, public policy makers. Can't say it like that because the wall goes up and you don't get past it. It's got to be a better way to say that and begin to do some of what you suggest.
→ {"text": "也許我們做得更好，因為我們是前民選官員、公共政策制定者。不能那樣說，因為會樹起一道牆，你無法跨越。必須有更好的方式來表達，並開始實施你建議的一些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. It'll come probably through religious communities, that the altering of consciousness with regard to an angelic realm, an other dimension of reality. That's where most people categorize these types of discussions.
→ {"text": "這可能會通過宗教社群來實現，關於天使領域、另一個現實維度的意識轉變。大多數人將這類討論歸類在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. Okay, and that's where you worked with the Jesuit Coordination Coalition. I think that's a good start. I think you can't leave out private industry. I think you can't leave out the universities. I mean, it's got to be a major coalition of things and institutions in our country and around the world that would come together more than one time with experts like yourselves and laymen like us and others who have interest in the issue because it is a world phenomenon. If we keep acting like it doesn't exist, then we all lose. The world loses.
→ {"text": "好的，那就是你與耶穌會協調聯盟合作的地方。我認為這是個好的開始。我認為不能排除私營企業。我認為不能排除大學。我是說，必須是我們國家和世界各地的事物與機構組成的重要聯盟，不只一次地聚集在一起，與像你們這樣的專家、像我們這樣的外行人以及其他對這個議題有興趣的人，因為這是一個世界現象。如果我們繼續假裝它不存在，那麼我們都會失敗。世界會失敗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. That's right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. Yes, sir. There are a few very interesting documents, even as early as July 1947, FBI, which was involved in investigating the so-called flying saucers very actively, had a memo indicating that the debris or whatever was recovered at Roswell was being transferred to Wright Field Dayton, Ohio, U.S. Air Force headquarters.

286. But regarding Roswell, there was -- back in 1994, the General Accounting Office of Congress was tasked with looking into the Roswell incident. All right. And this was on the initiative of the late Representative Stephen Schiff of New Mexico, whose constituents asked him to do this, and he did. Schiff talked about this at length, about how the Air Force and the Pentagon just stonewalled him, gave him nothing, gave him a lot of expletives as well in the process. But what the GAO's investigation was that the relevant records at Roswell from the end of 1946 into, I think, 1948, 49 were gone. All of the records that they were looking for, that they expected to find, were, surprise, not there. And there was no explanation given.

287. These were records, according to the GAO, that should not have been ever removed. They were permanent, but they were gone. And the Air Force, by the way, was very, very deft in their handling of this, because while the GAO investigation was going on, the United States Air Force took the initiative and did their own study, quote-unquote "study," in which they beat the GAO to the punch in terms of publicity, got their own thing out there and said, oh, yeah, it was a classified balloon project known as Mogul, which was designed to test to see whether the Soviets were detonating their own atomic devices. It's a big, big fat report. It looks very impressive. When you actually read it, it's a load of fluff, in my opinion. But that was their explanation. They beat the GAO to the punch and so they won the PR war.

288. Thank you. Mr. Sheehan, would you address, briefly, what is the theological implication?
→ {"text": "謝謝。希恩先生，你能簡要地說明神學上的含義嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. Yeah. Coming to grips with the full import of the theological reality is what undergirds all of this, is that for each of us to recognize that we are incarnated in a material form, but that there are other vibrational frequencies at which there are other dimensions of reality going on at the same time, our theology is the realm in which we deal with it. It's a category of knowledge in the human family in which we deal with other dimensions of reality. What happens after death? How did we get here? What are we doing here? What's our ultimate purpose? These are things that are raised by the UFO issue and that's why I reiterate that it's theology, it's in the realm of theology that we have to come to address this. When we do, what we're going to discover is that we're going to draw down into our culture a lot of those same realities that, for example, the Native American culture
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. and some of the aboriginal cultures understand that they are in a dynamic relationship with other dimensions, other vibrational frequencies. Our culture has closed itself off from that from the time of the enlightenment in trying to define ourselves as separated, individuated intellectual beings and that we're not in a harmonious, imbalanced relationship with the rest of reality. The consequences, of course, are falling upon us now because of the global climate change that we're experiencing, the contamination of our environment by ourselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. This is the crisis. I think one of the crises that's going to confront us and that my sense is that we're going to become much more, if we probe into the theology of all of this, we're going to come to have a much more profound appreciation for the Native American culture and the theology of the Native American culture and the faculty of intuitional perception that our human family has, which is a faculty that's evolving teleologically in our culture.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. This is what Teilhard de Chardin has dealt with it within the Jesuits. It's the cutting edge of modern theology and the insights that we've gained now through quantum physics since 1923 to 1926. We have to integrate into our scientific worldview the insights of quantum physics and we have to begin to readjust our basic worldview, as I pointed out before, to evolve a new worldview that integrates these capabilities.

All of that was taken to what is called the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. What was shipped, there was physical debris, actually parts of some kind of airplane. Another unusual aspect of it was though the metal wasn't any thicker than cellophane, but you put it in your hand and you crush it together and it flops right back into shape. Had it analyzed, it didn't come from Earth. There's no known, we have no known source of whatever that metal was.

There were dozens and dozens of witnesses on the materials and you're clearly one of them. At least in terms of the analysis of the materials, not necessarily gathering them up.

305. I can't point you to anyone that can add to that except Marcel, because he was the first one to pick it up. Went out to the crash, policed up the pieces of the airplane and there were specific markings on them, like they were identification numbers for parts or something of that nature. But it looked rather like Arabic writing. It didn't look like anything from our neck of the woods.

308. My question started off as the blue book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. Blue book was the US Air Force official public investigative body of UFOs from 1940. Actually, he was a successor of a couple of previous ones, started in 1952, went up to 1969 when it was closed down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. Okay, but it did include some of the Roswell stuff. It included nothing in Roswell, the blue book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. No, there's nothing on Roswell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. Okay, so that was, okay, well, I just, I asked about the blue book, and what did you say it was closed down, and what was the reason for that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. The end of 1969. Well, what happened in the 1960s is that the United States had a big, big wave of UFO sightings, 1965, '66, made the news. Gerald Ford, congressman in Michigan, talked about it on the floor of Congress. His constituents had seen UFOs, and he was not satisfied with the answers that were coming from the Air Force, and the pressure was really on the United States Air Force to do something about this. It's hard to remember because it's so far back in time, but the Air Force was losing a lot of credibility on this. A lot of people were not believing the Air Force explanations, and swamp gas became a big national joke at that time, and so really all the Air Force wanted to do was just get rid of UFOs, and so what they ended up doing was they contracted with the University of Colorado to conduct what was to be the first true public scientific investigation of UFOs, and the whole attitude
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. was whatever Colorado comes up with, that's what we're going to conclude, and what that study did, that was a whole big mess, and half the scientists got fired midway through the project because they were believers. The man running it, Edward Condon, was absolutely dead set against any kind of pro-UFO, pro-ET. So based on that recommendation, the Air Force was able to wash their hands, say thank you very much, and they said we're out of the business, we're not doing this anymore.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. And there's no way to retrieve any of the, I just got to make sure I understand this, and I appreciate it, because you've illuminated this greatly for me, but is there any way to find out exactly what was in the Blue Book at this point then? I'm looking for-- Yes, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. Well, the Blue Book files are-- They're still there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. You're saying they're absolutely being covered up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. No, no, the Blue Book files are-- Oh, we can still read those. Okay, well I was confused on that issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. The problem is-- Classified sections.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. Yeah, and the problem is the Roswell stuff is not in the Blue Book files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. Okay, now I've got a better understanding of all that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. And in the prior panel, Stanton Friedman referred to a memo by General Carroll Bolender in which he stated, in closing Blue Book down in 1969, that UFO reports affecting national security were not part of the Blue Book system, so Blue Book-- I do remember him saying that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. If I could turn to Mr. Huneeus and to Mr. Sheehan, religion has been brought up and implied in terms of this whole thing several ways, and now you're not trying to say that just because Pat Robertson has a particular view or because popes in the past have said things that clearly don't agree with what you're saying as a Jesuit, that religion is somehow against the idea of extraterrestrial life?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. No, in fact, it's quite the contrary, that, remember, religion, religiro, the Latin derivative of religiro is to relink.

325. The whole idea of relinking the intellect, intellectus, the root of intellect is intellectus, the ability to distinguish the difference between.

326. The whole ability that we develop somewhere between osteopithecus and homo erectus, this intellectual capacity, we alienated ourselves in a separate entity here behind our eyeballs from all the rest of reality.

327. Sure.

328. That's the danger.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. But I'm going to adjust this a little bit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. Was there an implication that it's more of the-- well, let me just say this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. Going to Christian religions in specific, you think there's some bias against the belief in extraterrestrial?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. Because you were talking about maybe we're going to have to accept this from a different religious perspective or something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. I think that within one of the features, the unique features of Catholic Christiology, for example, is each of the world views that I'd pointed out that have political implications, there are subsets of Catholic and Christian theology in all of those.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. So there's a reactionary world view that is fundamentalist, that everything is divided into good guys and bad guys, and there's Satan in angelic realms, and they've projected this satanic reality that they have onto extraterrestrials, which is very, very dangerous.

336. Well, I'm not in any way here to do missionary work for my particular religious faith or certainly to speak for my religious faith.

337. I'm a Mormon, but on a fundamental level, many Mormons believe it's consistent with the doctrines of the church that there is life outside the church.

338. It's an official doctrine of the Church of the Latter-day Saints, the actual belief in extraterrestrial intelligence.

339. Well, and I wanted to make that point clear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. Again, I'm not here for that to preach or anything like that, but I'm also ... I think, and I think most Mormons believe as I do on that, would still say that's still a leap to say that we've had the visitation, and there's nothing in the religious sense that would prohibit that, but we need as strong an evidence as we can to help this panel open up some congressional hearings, and by the way, I'm not giving up on the United States Congress yet.

341. I don't think we have to go to the United Nations.

350. Well, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Hooley.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. What kind of, I mean, the reaction over the last 30, 40 years in the United States, what's the reaction, and what has happened in the rest of the world?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. What's going on?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. Have there been sightings?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. Do they feel differently about it than we, you know, a lot of people feel about it here?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. What's happening elsewhere?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. Well, as I said in my statement, the one thing that I think even skeptics would have to agree is that the UFO phenomenon is worldwide.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. It doesn't matter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. I mean, it doesn't matter the religion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. It doesn't matter the ethnic origin, the language, the culture.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. It has been reported all over the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. Now, there are some sociological differences, as you would expect, from different cultures.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. But we see there's quite a rich history of UFO, even UFO investigations, official investigations, and we will be discussing this in a few more sessions during this week about investigations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. And we have, in fact, with us some members from some of the South American agencies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. So we've seen an opening in recent years, particularly in some European countries and particularly in South America.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. Now, odd as it may seem, it almost seems to be good politics now in South America to have a UFO investigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. I know it sounds awkward, but the Latin culture is obviously more open.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. It's much less ridicule in the media and all that about this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. And so we've seen a trend.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. It started with Uruguay back in the late '70s, and we have a representative that will be speaking later this week.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. And then Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina recently announced the creation of a UFO agency within the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. What is interesting about the South American approach to this phenomenon from an official point of view is that there is not an adversarial relationship between the official military agencies and the civilian UFO committees or UFO groups.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. Totally different from the United States, where even in the days of Blue Book, there was always a big fight between ufologists, civilian ufologists, and the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. That was classic, if you read the history of UFOs in the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. And it used to be a little bit like that, too, in South America, not as bad as here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. But now you see that they cooperate, and usually what happens is because a lot of these agencies, they have a limited budget, a small budget.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. So they call for volunteers from the civilian community, and that shows us a model.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. We don't have to have an adversarial.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. We don't have to fight the government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. This is a mystery.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. We should all work together in order to solve this mystery.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. So that's at least some of what is going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. But even Russia has had a lot of official investigations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. Even under the Soviet Union, there were committees from the -- there were actually two committees that were going on in the late '70s and '80s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. One was a public one through the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the other one was a secret one by the KGB and the Ministry of Defense, the Soviet military.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. Nobody knew about that one publicly, but the scientific one was even officially revealed even in the controlled Soviet media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. And then, of course, under Gorbachev in the 1980s, Glasnost, it opened up, and the UFO phenomenon became very, very popular in the late Soviet society and into modern Russia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. So China has had kind of a semi-official organization called the China UFO Research Organization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. We have one of its founding members here also attending this hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. So yes, you see it all over the world, and other countries actually have a more open attitude, I mean, officially.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. So it provides a model also for the U.S., in my opinion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. For any of the panelists, the other question I have, one of the other questions I have is a lot of people, when they talk about this, at least in this country, are ridiculed when they talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. This is, you know, pooha, you know, you're somewhere in outer space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. What -- why, I guess?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. Has there been some organization or is it just our attitudes in the United States tell me why there's so much skepticism in this country?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 2

396. I'll try to feel that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. I do find privately people are much more open about this than they are when they're in a public situation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. That's one thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

399. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

400. People discover that -- probably any of these researchers, and they discover, oh, you research UFOs, inevitably they will say, oh, let me tell you about what I saw last year, five years, 20 years ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. So those stories are out there, and people -- I firmly believe there is a true hunger for knowledge on this once people realize that there's something to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. But I agree with you, in our public discourse, this is a third rail, whether you are in major media or politics or academia, they're all really the same in this regard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. I had a professor at UCLA call me a number of years ago, a department chair said, well, I really just want to let you know I enjoy your books.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. I said, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. Why are you whispering in the phone?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. Which literally he was whispering, and he said the typical thing that every professor would say, well, my department is kind of political and not go -- right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. So it's always the retired ones who look for me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. But personally, I believe, you know, the tone was set back in the '50s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. And in fact, the top skeptic debunker in the U.S. at that time was a Harvard astronomer by the name of Donald Menzel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. Menzel wrote a number of books.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. He was like the pit bull guard dog maintaining orthodoxy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. You know, if some little community college professor was going to get out of line and talk about UFOs, here's Menzel, Harvard astronomer, who's going to argue with Menzel?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. And he'd slap them down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. Menzel, we learned years later, had a very, very close relationship with the National Security Agency, very close.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. Does this prove that the NSA used him in this capacity?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. Who knows?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. But these things -- this is how it looks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. Back in the late 1970s, journalist Carl Bernstein had the famous Rolling Stone article in which he said there are over 400 U.S. journalists that I have identified who had a covert relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. CIA promptly said, "Well, we don't do that anymore."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. And if you read the language carefully in their statements, especially in the 1990s, they're very lawyerly in their denials, it's very clear that there are relationships.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. So what I am suggesting, and I guess this is the conspiracy angle here, but I would suggest that there are proxies that work with national security elements.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. Look, it's an open revolving door in much of our society anyway.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. Most of this is out in the open, but I think that there are relationships, friendly relationships with academic and with media and political as well, where you have the herders who basically keep the underlings in line.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. And every now and then someone gets out of line and they have to be dealt with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. So I think that that's where the culture is created and it has a top-down effect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. And most people, they don't want to be Superman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. They have their jobs, they have got their family, they got their things, they can't fight the machine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. So they just, they live their lives and hope that someone else takes it on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. And there are documents that Mr. Dolan can tell you about, the internal documents in the Air Force and others where they consciously instruct their officers to ridicule and debunk people, is a specific official policy inside the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. People they know positively have seen one of these things to try to destroy their credibility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. In the Robertson panel, which is a famous CIA symposium that took place in January of 1953, in fact, they used the word "debunk."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. It's in the document itself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. As the Colonel says, you know, specifically assigned to go out and ridicule them and tell them they're ridiculous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. And most people can't stand up against that kind of thing coming from authority figures.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. The Robertson panel was the last act of the Truman administration, it was the last weekend of Harry Truman's presidency that this classified panel took place, and it was specifically related to UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. Very interesting little historical factoid there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. And as Daniel just pointed out, its conclusion was, this is a necessary topic and we must debunk it to the American people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. This is not a good thing for them to be thinking about, and they were working with the media to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. Where was the balloon, the Mogul balloon that was supposed to have been the Roswell incident, from where was it supposedly launched?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. The Mogul, I thought they were at White Sands, Alamogordo, that area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. We have the record, I'm so sorry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. From where?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. You know what a pie ball is, it's a high-altitude balloon that they track, they launch them and then track them so they can keep track of upper air currents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. But when it was launched, when Marcel launched the thing, he would have been probably standing right in front of base ops because that's where they send them up from.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. From where?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. Base operations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. You see the fighter squadrons or bomber squadrons or whatever they have, their own particular area, but transient airplanes always launch from base operations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. How close is one of those to Roswell?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. It's on Roswell base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. So what they're saying is that the balloon was launched there and crashed there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. I don't know where exactly that it crashed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. See, these balloons were supposed to be determining possible Soviet nuclear detonations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. I'm just curious where they, because if it was launched somewhere else, the probability that landing at Roswell was vanishingly small.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. I had a course in advanced statistics and it's vanishingly small probability.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. The United States Air Force in their 1994 reports said these were launched out of White Sands and actually they had a schedule of a number of these balloon launches that went down and were recovered.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. So there were several that were from the spring of 1947 and in fact they speculated, this wasn't really a slam dunk, but they indicated that they thought that they'd identified the one launch that was in fact supposedly the Roswell crash and I'm trying to remember the date on that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. As has been mentioned, the curious thing about all of this is in the GAO report, there was nothing for them to look at because all of the relevant information had been destroyed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. They had no idea at whose command had been destroyed and this is very unorthodox.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. It should have been there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. Kind of interesting, isn't it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. I was a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I think it was simply called the Science Committee then.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. When Schiff held this, I thought it was a hearing apparently, it was a briefing and it was what, about '94 or '95, I came to the Congress in '93 and I remember his interest in that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. When I was first approached about this week's activities, I was cautioned that if you do this you could possibly be relegated to the lunatic fringe and this may not be good for your potential activities for the rest of your political productive life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. I'm 87 in five weeks, so I don't know how much remains anyhow, but I said, "I'm going to do this because I think there's a very serious constitutional issue involved here."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. Whether there are UFOs or not, whether they are extraterrestrial or not is really quite irrelevant to whether or not there ought to be hearings on this because the First Amendment to the Constitution says, "The right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. Mr. Sheehan, doesn't this fall within that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. Oh yes, there's no doubt about this, but the fact of the matter is in a national security state, from the passage of the National Security Act of 1947, there has been an entire caveat on the Constitution that things that fall under national security, when Oliver North can sit right in front of you and say, "Sure, I lied to you, the Congress, because this was a covert operation, that we're in charge, you're not in charge."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. There's an entire national security state kind of subculture that believes that they have the right, not only to hold information back from Congress, but to openly defy Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. When you pass the Boland Amendment, prohibiting them from engaging in the covert operations against Nicaragua, they go ahead and do it anyhow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. The danger as a national security state, and if it arose in the context of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, we should move very aggressively at the end of the Cold War to try to disassemble some of those structures of the national security state, not try to create a new one, so that they went searching very quickly for some ultimate other that they had to find, and they ended up having Afghanistan, or Iran, or Iraq.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. It's a mindset, and it's that whole kind of retrenchment into a defensive position in the face of the ultimate other.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. It's an ultimate mindset that we have to try to overcome, and as I point out, it's a theological issue because that is a malfunction of our intellect, and it cuts us off from our harmonious relationship not only with the rest of the universe, but all other intelligent species in the universe, and that's what we have to address, I think.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. It's a worldview issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. For 20 years in the Congress, I served on the Armed Services Committee, and I remembered Eisenhower's caution as he left office, that we should be concerned about the military-industrial complex.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. I understand that in the original draft, it was military-industrial-congressional complex, and he didn't want to be too political, so he took out the congressional.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. It's too bad he did that, because this really is a military-industrial-congressional complex.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

484. The F-35 is built in 48 states.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. There are 96 senators, and I don't know how many hundred representatives support the F-35, not because we may need it, but because it creates jobs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. Too many of us cannot differentiate between jobs that consume wealth and jobs that create wealth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. It's on the front page of the Washington Post today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. You look at the headlines of the Washington Post, and it says that the sequester of trying to cut back on the military budget, all the arguments are coming out now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. We can't do that because of all the jobs and the employment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. It's an old saw.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. We've developed an economy that is so reliant upon military spending that, in fact, it drives the policies to go looking for adversaries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

492. If we lose the adversary of the Soviet Union on December 31st of 1991 with the dissolving of the Soviet Union, it takes them less than a few years to find another one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. If you have to go so desperately that you're looking to Afghanistan and Iran as being your ultimate threat to the most powerful nation in the history of the human civilization, there's a motive for that, and it's not because they're threatening you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. We had a hearing on this in the Congress about the economic effects ... If I was chairman, I wouldn't have held a hearing ... economic effects of sequestration.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. When it came time for my question, my five minutes, I said, "Suppose when we left here tonight we broke all the windows out of this building, and we did that all over Washington, and overnight a crew came in and replaced all of those broken windows, and we did this every day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. We broke out all the windows and the crew would replace them all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. Wouldn't that create a lot of jobs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. Just think of the jobs that that would create."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

499. My question was, do you think that would have a long-term beneficial effect on the economy?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

500. I wanted them to understand the difference between jobs that create wealth and jobs that consume wealth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. Well, we've been talking about the Constitution and why I'm here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

502. I'm here because I think that the Congress owes the American people a hearing on this subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

503. You may be dead wrong.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. There may be nothing to UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. That is irrelevant.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. You have a right to petition the government for redress or grievances.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. All of my questions have been anticipated by my colleagues.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

508. Thank you all very much for a very good panel, and we'll now stand in recess for lunch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

509. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
