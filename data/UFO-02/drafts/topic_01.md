## Speaker Group 1

1. It's my distinct honor to once again administer the oath to our second panel of the first day of the citizen's hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

2. This panel will run until approximately 1245.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

3. We'll have opening statements of 10 to 15 minutes maximum and then questions of five to seven minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

4. So Mr. Gillin, you've already shared the oath.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

5. So it's your option whether to do it again, but if the rest of the panel could repeat after me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

6. I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth to the members of this committee today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

7. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

8. We are for the second time this morning honored to begin with Mr. Dolan.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. My goodness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. Thank you, esteemed members of the committee, and I will keep my remarks a little more mercifully brief than the last time, and I apologize for not having this statement for you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. I will provide that for you for the record before we're done here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. I just want to point out that researchers of UFO phenomenon have long argued with each other over many aspects of this phenomenon, but one conclusion that I think all of us share, at least serious research, is that the UFOs have become a central, although covert, but essential component of U.S. history in the modern era and indeed of world history.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. But as everyone knows, you can't have much of a history that is a reliable, factually based history without access to documents, and it's the documents of the past that enable us in the present to try to puzzle through the complexities and to find solid ground, as it were.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. And yet it's easy for us to forget that access to most of the key UFO documents we now have came to us by way of historical accident, and it happened to be a fleeting one at that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. All through the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s and well into the 1970s, there were many thousands of classified pages written about UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. Of course the general public didn't know about this, and neither, it appears, did many or maybe even most members of Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. But then came the end of the war in Vietnam and, of course, Watergate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. And this was a certain key moment in American history, a moment in which the United States Congress investigated the intelligence community, for example, and when it reopened the investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. And it was a moment in which Congress dramatically strengthened the United States Freedom of Information Act, enabling U.S. citizens to petition their government for documents not merely relating to them personally but to the nation in terms of broad issues of public policy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. Well, little did members of Congress realize that of all subsequent Freedom of Information Act requests, the most popular category would be related to UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. And indeed, during the late 1970s, over 10,000 pages of documents relating to UFOs were released.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. The party lasted until about 1982 when a presidential order by Ronald Reagan made FOIA substantially less user friendly and did not require many agencies to reply in a timely manner at all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. The result was a major ballooning in costs to those people making requests.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. So the glory era of Freedom of Information documents, at least pertaining to UFOs, came to an end.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. To this day, more than half of all U.S. declassified UFO documents come from that period of time, over 30 years ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. Great for the Carter administration, shame on the subsequent ones.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. And yet we remain fortunate, I think, because the documents that we have, thank goodness, give us at least enough.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. They give us enough of a history to hold on to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. They give us enough solid ground.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. And their aggregate message is startlingly clear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. UFOs have been the subject not merely of interest to our nation's military and intelligence community, but at times a subject of concern and even alarm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. But how could it be otherwise when we have report after report of violations of sensitive airspace by objects that defy any logical or conventional explanation, whether the scene was Los Alamos during 1948 and 1949, or Oak Ridge Laboratories from 1948 through much of the 1950s, or the many military bases during the 50s, 60s, and 70s that reported such events.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. The question remains, how could this not be a matter of grave concern to those parties responsible for maintaining the integrity of their airspace?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. And not surprisingly, we find the tone of their memos and requests for information to be appropriate to the matter at hand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. Here's one CIA memo from 1949, puts the matter in this very succinct way, quote, "Information is desired if this was some new or experimental aircraft or for any explanation whatsoever."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. And these statements are, in fact, typical.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. And the situation became so stressful to the CIA and elsewhere that on December 2nd, 1952, this is right at the very end of the Truman presidency, the CIA's chief of scientific intelligence, H. Marshall Chadwell, wrote a classified memo to his boss, that was the director of the CIA, Walter Bedell Smith.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. And a key paragraph in this memo is as follows.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles, end quote.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. I think this is a statement that bears very close scrutiny.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. Here is yet another comment by a high-level U.S. official that UFOs were real, probably artificial, probably intelligently operated, and not apparently ours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. And nor was there serious consideration that these were Soviet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. So I would ask, if not American, if not Soviet, if not natural phenomena, and if they appeared to be technological and under intelligent control, well, we begin to run out of viable options.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. It is access to documents such as these that enable us to know with certainty that UFOs were a matter of serious concern to individuals at the highest levels of U.S. national security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. I would want to stress that I don't think any of the formally declassified documents we have by themselves prove that UFOs are ET.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. I don't think any of them do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. But I would argue that if you take the top 50, even the top 10, that they make a very powerful case, I would say not even a matter of speculation but a matter of proof that the phenomenon was considered real by the responsible members of our national security community.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. That I would say is not a matter of debate or speculation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. And really the questions that we need to ask is why were they considering it, and did they form any opinions themselves?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. Getting at that answer is a little more difficult.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. But nonetheless, the bottom line is these documents do prove this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. And it's important because all of these levels of concern were consistently voiced within the classified world, but they were not given out publicly all through the '40s and '50s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. Right up to our own era, the formal public statements are always the same, that there's nothing to this, that it may be interesting or may not, but we're not interested in it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. We don't do UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. And fortunately, as the historical accident of freedom of information turned out, those documents proved the lie to those statements of denial.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. So today, official pronouncements about UFOs by the government and military follows the exact same tone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. There's really no difference between what they say now and what they said 50 years ago, except they're a little less insulting about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. Like in the early years, there were a number of statements that talked about people just kind of being crazy, psychopathological, that you don't hear that anymore.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. But other than that, it's really the same type of tone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. Unfortunately, though, that we don't have the kind of access to classified information on UFOs as we once briefly obtained in the past.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. And yet, enough genuine and recent UFO accounts have become known to us, many of which involve US military, that we can see that very little has changed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. Something important is happening behind the veil of the classified world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. My question to you is, how long will current members of Congress and the public at large be content to roll over and be spoon-fed nonsense by responsible officials when in fact they deserve the truth?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. Good afternoon, or good morning, distinguished members and panelists of the Citizen Hearing on Unidentified Flying Objects, UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. My name is Antonio Huneeus, and I'm a Chilean-American journalist who has been actively involved in covering the mystery of UFOs and its hypothesis of extraterrestrial ET origin.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. Other theories are also possible and should be considered for the past 37 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. My very first article on this topic was published in a small New York newspaper on July 4, 1977, coinciding with the beginning of my professional career as a journalist in the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. I was born in this country, but my family was from Chile.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. My father worked for several years in the United Nations in the early formative years of this international body, during which time I was born in New York in 1950.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. After graduating from high school in Santiago in 1969, I went to Europe and took a semester on French language and civilization at the Sorbonne University in Paris, and later studied journalism at the University of Chile in Santiago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. I worked for a while as a science journalist for a weekly magazine in Santiago and also wrote regularly for a daily newspaper in the mid-70s, where I was one of the first journalists in Chile to cover ecological or green issues on a regular basis.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. This was, however, a period of great turmoil in Chile following the military coup of September 11, 1973, the first time that fateful date shows up in modern history.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. I might add, so I took the decision to claim my U.S. citizenship and move to this country where I have lived ever since.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. First in the Washington, D.C. area, then New York for some 25 years, back to the Beltway where I lived in Northern Virginia for about three years, and now the Phoenix, Arizona area where I moved in 2009 after I was hired to work as a full-time paid journalist and editor of Open Minds magazine and also a writer for our website, Open Minds.TV, and other production and research activities in ufology for the company Open Minds Production.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. The subject of UFOs is a contentious one where many different views and attitudes coexist, sometimes in a friendly manner, sometimes in a more acrimonious way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. But there is no doubt in my mind that there is at least one conclusion we can and should all agree, UFOs are definitely a global phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. They're cited visually, on film, and on radar, reported, investigated sometimes officially, sometimes by private organizations, and covered by both the local and international media all over the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. It doesn't really matter what is the culture, language, religion, ethnic origin, and level of development and technological capabilities of a country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. UFOs have been reported everywhere, from Alaska to Chile and Argentina and the Americas, all over Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and the oceans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. There are well-documented cases in many parts of the world, including Brazil, France, Iran, Russia, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, and many other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. Regardless of what turns out to be the final origin of this mystery, it has a great potential of unifying the different and often divided parts of our world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. The reason is simple.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. No matter how big our ideological, religious, or cultural differences are, we would all tend to unite in the face of an unknown, possibly extraterrestrial presence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. It is for this reason that some efforts have been made over the years to bring the subject to the attention of the United Nations Organization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. This international body, despite its flaws, is the only organization that truly represents all the nations of the world, and so it seems to be the logical place where this issue could be dealt with in a global, formal, and legal manner.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. I will outline briefly the history of UFOs at the United Nations, a subject that I know very well firsthand since I personally attended as a journalist the famous historical UFO hearing before the UN Special Political Committee on November 27, 1978.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. This was the result of a two-year lobbying effort by Sir Eric Gairy, the Prime Minister of Grenada, a small Caribbean island which had gained independence from Great Britain in 1978.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. I'm submitting for the record a long article detailing the history of UFOs at the UN, which I published in the third issue of Open Minds Magazine in 2010.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. Grenada's UFO proposal was first raised officially by Prime Minister Gairy and Grenada's UN Ambassador Wellington Friday at a meeting of the UN General Assembly Special Political Committee on November 28, 1977.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. Grenada proposed the, quote, "establishment of an agency or a department of the United Nations for undertaking, coordinating, and disseminating the results of research into unidentified flying objects, UFOs, and related phenomena."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. Grenada made further statements on November 30 and December 6, 1977.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. In an earlier speech in October, Prime Minister Gairy disclosed his own sighting, quote, "I have myself seen an unidentified flying object, and I have been totally overwhelmed by what I have seen."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. As a result of all this effort, on December 13, 1977, the General Assembly adopted decision 32/424, which acknowledged the draft resolution submitted by Grenada.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. Secretary General Kurt Waldheim duly forwarded decision 32/424 to the member states by a note verbal on March 13, 1978.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. However, only three governments responded, India, Luxembourg, and Seychelles, and only two specialized agencies, International Civil Aviation Organization and UNESCO, replied with a flat, "No comments to offer."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. On the 3rd, Grenada launched a new offensive in 1978 with the help of one of the original NASA astronauts, Gordon Cooper, among others.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. A group of recognized experts was assembled by Gairy to testify at a hearing before the Special Political Committee on November 27, 1978, which became the high point of the Grenada initiative.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. Besides Sir Eric Gairy and Ambassador Friday, who was now Grenada's Minister of Education, the hearing included testimony by astronomer Dr. J. Alan Hynek, the former scientific consultant for the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book, who went on to found the Center for UFO Studies, CUFOS; Dr. Jacques Vallee, Stanton Friedman, who was present at the citizen hearing; and a firsthand witness account by Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence Coyne of the U.S.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. Army Reserve on the famous October 18, 1973, UFO helicopter near collision in Ohio; a letter of endorsement by astronaut Gordon Cooper, who was then working for the Walt Disney Company as Vice President of Research and Development for Epcot, was read into the record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. Besides mentioning his own sighting and views on UFOs, Cooper wrote that, "We need to have a top-level coordinated program to scientifically collect and analyze data from all over Earth concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interface with these visitors in a friendly fashion."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. At a meeting of the UN General Assembly on December 18, 1978, Decision 33/426 was adopted with the same heading to the previous Decision 32/424, establishment of an agency or a Department of the United Nations for undertaking, coordinating, and disseminating the results of research into unidentified flying objects and related phenomena."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. The Grenada Initiative was gradually opening the door to UFOs at the UN, but unfortunately the effort came to an abrupt halt when the Gairy government was overthrown by a Marxist revolution led by Maurice Bishop of the New Jewel movement in March 1979.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. Ironically, Gary was in New York to meet with Kurt Valheim regarding Decision 33/426 when the coup took place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. Some minor efforts to rekindle the UFO initiative at the United Nations were attempted by civilian investigators since the Grenada coup of 1979, but with no success whatsoever, because only sovereign member country can bring this issue back officially to the UN, and no government has done so since the Grenada Initiative of the late 70s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. The good news, however, is that we don't have to reinvent the wheel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. The UN Decisions 32/424 and 33/426 are already on the books and could be revived if there was political will.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. In closing these opening remarks, I want to make a few important points.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. While it's true that the majority of UFO sightings have mundane explanations, a fact recognized by most competent investigators and scientists, if you really study with an open mind the extensive data bank of UFO cases collected worldwide during the last six decades, you will find a small percentage of truly puzzling incidents that defy any conventional explanation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. The prevailing view among most researchers and the media is that these cases have an ET origin, but this is not the only explanation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. Other theories, including interdimensional or multiple universes, have also been advanced.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. Even time travel has been proposed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. In other words, UFOs would be our own devices from the future coming back in time for unknown reasons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. I realize all this sounds like science fiction, but think for a minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. Didn't you see people talking to each other at huge distances while viewing themselves on a screen in lots of sci-fi movies from the 50s and 60s?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. Well, this happens now every day through Skype and the internet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. Similar examples can be multiplied at infinitum.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. What is important is to look at all the data without any preconceived ideas or beliefs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. The late Dr. Hynek used to say that UFOs were likely signaling the next scientific revolution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. But we will never get there if we don't study the phenomenon in a truly comprehensive and unbiased way, and I might add, with the proper resources to do so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. The political implications, or exopolitical as it's now referred, are even bigger.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. The alien can become a catalyst to unify the peoples of Earth to realize that mankind must grow way beyond our current limitations if we are going to survive and prosper in the future.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. Many believe that open contact will never happen in an open way unless mankind's level of consciousness makes a significant jump.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. Let me finish with an appropriate quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet, "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, that are dreamt in your philosophy."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. Good morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. Good morning, congressmen and congressmen and Senator Gravel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. My name is Dan Sheehan.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. I am general counsel for the committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. I've been asked to speak briefly here today to address a few different instances that have occurred in my career as an attorney that bear upon this particular subject that have led to me ending up being general counsel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. I was also general counsel for the original disclosure conference that we had in 2001.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. So I've been around for a while on this particular area and it arose because I was chief counsel for the United States Jesuit headquarters in Washington, D.C. here back in 1976 when President Carter was elected president.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. And immediately after his election in November of 1976, President Carter called into his office the then central intelligence agency director, who was George H.W. Bush.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. And President Carter asked to be briefed by the director of central intelligence on the issue of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. And in that meeting, CIA Director Bush asked the president-elect if the president-elect would leave him in as the central intelligence agency director and that he would promise that he would never run for political office in his life if Carter would agree to keep him in as the director of the CIA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. Bush wanted to, at that time, become more or less like J. Edgar Hoover had become at the FBI, that he would remain, that it would be above politics, that he would remain in that position.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. President Carter reiterated his request for the UFO information, saying that he had his own person in mind to be the director of the central intelligence agency, which happened to be Ted Sorensen at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. And Bush at that time then refused to provide the information to him, saying that he did not have adequate clearances, he was not the president yet, and that he should ask his own central intelligence agency director for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. But if he wanted to have the information ahead of time, that what he could do is he could contact the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Representatives, and they had an ongoing relationship with the Science and Technology Division of the Congressional Research Service that could go about getting things declassified to show him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. That is what generated the request from the Congressional Research Service to me as the general counsel for the Jesuit headquarters in the United States, asking if I could gain access to the Vatican Library to obtain the information that the Vatican has in its library in its classified sections to deliver to the president for his review.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. I did that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. I contacted the Jesuit, who happens to be the head of the Vatican Library, requesting this information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. And much to my surprise, I was denied information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. I wrote a second letter to them saying, "Look, I guess you must not know who we are here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. This is the Jesuit headquarters in the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. We have 10 provinces here in the United States, more than any other country in the world, and we're requesting this information to share with the president."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. They still declined.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. So I had to report that to Marcia Smith, who was the head of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress Congressional Research Service, and she asked if I would be willing to become counsel, special counsel, to this investigation that was being conducted by the Science and Technology Committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. I agreed to do this, and I told her that I would need to have access to certain kinds of information, that I would like to have declassified or get to see it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. And she said, "What would you like to see?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. And I said, "Well, the first thing I'd like to see is the classified sections of Project Blue Book, those sections that have been referred to by Mr. Dolan earlier and by Gordon as not really available."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. Because to our surprise, I was granted permission to see them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. And they brought them to Washington, and they brought them over to the Jefferson Building, the extension, to the Congressional Library before it was even open, the brand new building that they built across the street.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. And so I was invited to come over there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. I went over there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. No one else was in the building.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. They had security people at the door, and I went over, and I was brought downstairs into a room where they had these shoeboxes with microfilm in them and documents, et cetera.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. And in my review of those documents, I came upon photographs of unquestioned UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. It wasn't any question about what they were.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. It wasn't a light in the sky.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. It wasn't a vague report about having seen something going very fast by.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. These were photographs, official United States Air Force photographs, some taken through gun sights, but another one of a crashed saucer on the ground, that there was snow in the photographs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. It showed that the saucer had hit into a field and had plowed across the field and was stuck into a snowbank, set up about a 45-degree angle.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. And I could see in the photographs U.S. Air Force personnel dressed in heavy parkas taking actually film with those two cameras with the great big camera circles on top, the films like this, so it must have been in the 1950s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. And I saw this, and I realized that I could see in one of the photographs symbols that were on the dome of the UFO sticking in the snowbank.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. So what I did, I had one of those, they were the microfiche, those little machines you put the microfiche in, you crank the little handle, very high-tech this was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. And so what I did is they had told me that I wasn't allowed to take any notes when I went in there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. The two security men at the door told me I was not allowed to take any notes, but I actually had a yellow pad under my arm when I went in like this, and so when I went in and when I saw these photographs, what I did is I cranked down the focus on the machine so that I could get a close-up view of these symbols that were around the dome of the UFO, and what I did is I opened up the yellow pad and I put the yellow pad in there and I traced the actual symbols that were along the base of the saucer, and then I closed it up and I said, "I think I'd probably better leave now because I have this."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. So what I did is I put all this stuff back into the boxes and I put the yellow pad under my arm and I walked back out, and the two security guys said, "I'd like my briefcase back."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. They handed me my briefcase and I started to walk away, and one of them says, "What's that under your arm?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. And I said, "Oh, this is a yellow pad," and he opened it up and he leafed through all the pages and there was nothing there, because I had put it on the inside of the cardboard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. And so I took that back with me to Jesuit headquarters and I brought it to Father Bill Davis, who was my superior at the Jesuit headquarters, and we then agreed to go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. We gathered all 54 of the major religious denominations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. They're Washington, D.C. offices, and we brought them into a meeting and we proposed to them from the Jesuit national headquarters that we establish as a priority having the churches try to ascertain what information we could get, and that we would get the backing of the churches and then go to the Vatican Library and see if we could start to address this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. Now, that is what we did, and Father Bill Davis, when I asked him this, he got puzzled and he reached down and he pulled open the drawer out of his desk at the Jesuit headquarters right over by DuPont Circle, 1717 Mass Ave is where we were, and he opened up the drawer and he pulled out a photograph, and he said, "This is a photograph that I got from my sister.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. Her husband is in the tower in the Seattle, Washington airport.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. He's a flight controller and his best friend is a commercial pilot, and he took this photograph out of his window of the commercial airline, and he handed me the photograph of this."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. We showed this to the people at the Washington Interreligious Staff Council that we organized, asking them if they would make this a priority, and they said, "Are there any other subjects you'd like to discuss?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. Instead of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. They didn't want to address that at that time, and what happened, I was contacted then by Marsha Smith, who was directing the investigation for President Carter at the Congressional Research Service, and she asked me if I would go to meet with the people at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California in the SETI Program, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and give them a briefing on the theological implications of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. I was privileged to deliver a three-hour seminar to the top 50 scientists in the SETI Program on the theological implications of contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. Then in 1994, I was contacted by Dr. John Mack, who was the chairman of the Department of Clinical Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, because I had graduated from Harvard College and graduated from Harvard Law School, where I was one of the founders of the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review, and I had gone on to Harvard Divinity School.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. He contacted me and asked me if I would represent him, because he had written a book based upon his clinical assistance to high-level military officials and others in the country who had been sent to have psychological background done on them, who had reported these direct contacts with extraterrestrial vehicles of this kind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. When I met with him, he had written this book, and the faculty committee at Harvard University had called him into a session with the legal counsel from Harvard University and the head of the dean of the medical school, getting ready to challenge his tenure for his having written this book, that it was undermining the worldview of Harvard University.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. We met with Lawrence Rockefeller, and Lawrence Rockefeller agreed to fund what would really amount to grand rounds to present to the Harvard faculty all of the basic information that we had on the existence of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. They then dropped the hearings and said they didn't want to have these hearings turned into a circus.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. Now those were my initial contacts with them, and so I have delivered a number of presentations to the International UFO Congress over the years on the theological implications of contact with an extraterrestrial civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. As you may know, the Vatican has now started to issue press statements.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. They actually held a major press conference talking about the fact that in light of the more recent discoveries of the increasing number of planets that they now realize have suns and atmosphere and are in what they call the Goldilocks zone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. They're close enough to their planet, their sun and their solar systems, but not so far away that they're likely to have potential life on them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. As these planets began to multiply, the Vatican has now held an official press conference announcing that they in fact have now taken the position that the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence in a highly technologically developed intelligence is not inconsistent with Catholic theology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. That is what is going on right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. There are very high level meetings going on right now with the new pope to discuss what positions are going to be taken by the International Catholic Church with regard to the theology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. My understanding is as former chief council for the Jesuits that the fact is that the Catholic Church does not want to be behind the power curve on this issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. They realize that with the increasing contact and discovery of these additional planets that it's going to become clear within our generation, within our lifetimes that in fact highly technologically developed extraterrestrial intelligence actually exists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. The findings of the Congressional Research Service that were delivered to President Carter is that based upon all of their analysis that they have come to the conclusion, this is an official conclusion of the Congressional Research Service, that they have come to a 95% probability projection that there are from 2 to 10 highly technologically developed extraterrestrial civilizations within our own galaxy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. Now, remember in closing, there in our galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, there are 50 billion star systems in our galaxy and there are 50 billion trillion galaxies that are now known.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. The question and the abiding question and it's the one that you and I discussed last night, Congressman Bartlett, have these vehicles developed the capacity to transport vehicles beyond the speed of light?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. Because if they have, then all these questions now become focused, that that means that they would be able to be here, come here and go and if they have, then all of these sightings that we've talked about, all these hundreds of witnesses that we've talked about, then are talking about a very real phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. I'll close with this one observation, when I was legal counsel for the Iran-Contra investigations, that we were the ones that actually initially discovered the Iran-Contra weapons supply trafficking, and when I delivered this information to Peter Rodino, who was at the time the chair of the Judiciary Committee of the House, through Scott Armstrong, Scott Armstrong, as you'll recall, was the staff person on Rodino's staff of the Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigations, who discovered the taping system in the White House that Alexander Butterfield revealed this to Scott.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. So I went and brought this information to him, and because of his close relationship with Peter Rodino, he delivered all of the information we had about the off-the-shelf enterprise, the involvement of Poindexter and everyone else, and the response of Peter Rodino was, he said, "Scott," he said, "my God," he said, "if what you're telling me is true about this off-the-shelf enterprise going on, delivering these weapons contrary to the orders of Congress, why then," he said, "I've been telling my constituencies that they didn't like the way that American policy was going, that they should write a letter to their congressperson, and if their congressperson didn't do what they wanted them to do, you should vote for someone else for Congress, but if what you're telling me is true, Scott, my God, we haven't even been in control.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. I'm not going to allow the Congress of the United States to investigate anything like that." And that's the issue that's before us now, because if, in fact, we're not in ultimate control, and there is an extraterrestrial intelligence of this type of sophistication that's been visiting our planet and entering our airspace and outmaneuvering our aircraft, it's perfectly clear that from a political consciousness that abides inside our executive branch and inside our legislature, that is not something that they want to share with the American people, because it would ultimately undermine the confidence of the governed in their governors.

204. Force Blue Book. I was a student at Oregon State starting in 1947, and in my junior year I was asked what specialty I wanted to be assigned when I graduated. An advisor told me about the Office of Special Investigations. It sounded like an exciting and glamorous job, so I volunteered. Brigadier General Carroll, a former FBI director of the Washington District, was commissioned as an Air Force general and assumed command of the OSI.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. The OSI of course was also given the added responsibility of investigating the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects. The OSI assignment required that I have final top secret clearance granted before I could even report for duty. That caused a delay in my reporting because I in fact am adopted and all of my medical and birth records and all that are sealed.

206. Every year they straighten out that mess, and I reported to DO-20 at McCord Air Force Base Washington. There my training officer was a special agent named John Drahos. Under his supervision I began investigating UFO reports and recording the incidents in the Air Force's Blue Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. The most controversial UFO incident that occurred in my early training deserves special mention because of its unique factor. An F-100D pilot, the Ds, they'd launch them normally just in twos rather than fours like tactical fighters. Anyway, he pulled up on this UFO and it was approximately 30 yards directly behind the thing. The F-86 today carries a total of 36 two and a half inch, or two and a half, let me get this straight, carries 36 of those two and a half inch rockets and they're carried in a pod that drops and it drops and automatically fires when it comes down. Well, he got the clearance to fire which kind of surprised everybody and he blew that UFO out of the sky, but the problem is that the recording of the incident, well, let me get this exactly right, the UFO intercept violated the prohibited zone at Hanford's Atomic Energy Facility. He was a wingman and pulled up straight ahead

208. and it was given a clearance to fire. When the weapon fired, the pod dropped, but his airplane exploded. They drugged the Colorado River, I mean the Columbia River in a 60 mile area and they never found a piece or part or anything even pertaining to it. I mentioned that I had just a very fast look at the magic report. I hope you people are familiar with it, but if you're not, it is the original report that was prepared. President Truman was the chairman. The people who were on that committee and I just did just get a very quick look at it, but I could easily remember who they were because of who they were. They included the chiefs of the president of course and also the chiefs of staff of all of the armed forces, arms of the United States. In other words, the chief of naval operations and the head of the Coast Guard and on and on. That terminates my presentation.
