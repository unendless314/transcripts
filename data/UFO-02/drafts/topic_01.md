1. It's my distinct honor to once again administer the oath to our second panel of the first day of the citizen's hearing.
→ {"text": "我再次深感榮幸，能為公民聽證會第一天的第二場小組證人主持宣誓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. This panel will run until approximately 1245.
→ {"text": "本場小組將進行至大約 12 點 45 分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. We'll have opening statements of 10 to 15 minutes maximum and then questions of five to seven minutes.
→ {"text": "我們將安排最長 10 至 15 分鐘的開場陳述，接著是 5 至 7 分鐘的提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. So Mr. Gillin, you've already shared the oath.
→ {"text": "Gillin 先生，您已經宣過誓了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

5. So it's your option whether to do it again, but if the rest of the panel could repeat after me.
→ {"text": "所以您可以選擇是否再次宣誓，但請其他小組成員跟著我複誦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth to the members of this committee today.
→ {"text": "我在此鄭重宣誓，今日將向委員會成員陳述真相，且僅陳述真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. We are for the second time this morning honored to begin with Mr. Dolan.
→ {"text": "我們今早第二次深感榮幸，能邀請 Dolan 先生率先發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. My goodness.
→ {"text": "天啊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. Thank you, esteemed members of the committee, and I will keep my remarks a little more mercifully brief than the last time, and I apologize for not having this statement for you.
→ {"text": "謝謝尊敬的委員會成員，這次我會稍微簡短一些，比上次仁慈一點，我為未能提供書面陳述向各位致歉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. I will provide that for you for the record before we're done here.
→ {"text": "在我們結束前，我會提供書面陳述供記錄留存。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. I just want to point out that researchers of UFO phenomenon have long argued with each other over many aspects of this phenomenon, but one conclusion that I think all of us share, at least serious research, is that the UFOs have become a central, although covert, but essential component of U.S. history in the modern era and indeed of world history.
→ {"text": "我只想指出，不明飛行物現象的研究者們長期以來在此現象的許多方面爭論不休，但我認為我們所有人，至少是認真的研究者，都有一個共識：不明飛行物已成為現代美國史乃至世界史中的核心要素——儘管是隱密的，但卻不可或缺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. But as everyone knows, you can't have much of a history that is a reliable, factually based history without access to documents, and it's the documents of the past that enable us in the present to try to puzzle through the complexities and to find solid ground, as it were.
→ {"text": "但眾所周知，沒有文件檔案就無法建立可靠的、基於事實的歷史，正是過去的文件使我們在當下能夠嘗試拼湊出複雜的真相，找到堅實的立足點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. And yet it's easy for us to forget that access to most of the key UFO documents we now have came to us by way of historical accident, and it happened to be a fleeting one at that.
→ {"text": "然而我們很容易忘記，我們現在擁有的大多數關鍵不明飛行物文件，是透過歷史的偶然機會才得以取得，而且這個機會稍縱即逝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. All through the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s and well into the 1970s, there were many thousands of classified pages written about UFOs.
→ {"text": "從 1940 年代、1950 年代、1960 年代到 1970 年代初期，有數以千計的機密頁面記載了關於不明飛行物的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. Of course the general public didn't know about this, and neither, it appears, did many or maybe even most members of Congress.
→ {"text": "當然，一般大眾對此並不知情，而且看來，許多甚至是大多數的國會議員也不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. But then came the end of the war in Vietnam and, of course, Watergate.
→ {"text": "但隨後越戰結束，當然還有水門事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. And this was a certain key moment in American history, a moment in which the United States Congress investigated the intelligence community, for example, and when it reopened the investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others.
→ {"text": "這是美國歷史上的關鍵時刻，在這一時期，美國國會調查了情報機構，並重啟了對約翰·F·甘迺迪總統與小馬丁·路德·金恩博士等人遇刺案的調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. And it was a moment in which Congress dramatically strengthened the United States Freedom of Information Act, enabling U.S. citizens to petition their government for documents not merely relating to them personally but to the nation in terms of broad issues of public policy.
→ {"text": "也是在這個時期，國會大幅強化了美國資訊自由法（FOIA），使美國公民不僅能申請與個人相關的文件，也能申請涉及國家廣泛公共政策議題的文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. Well, little did members of Congress realize that of all subsequent Freedom of Information Act requests, the most popular category would be related to UFOs.
→ {"text": "然而國會議員們萬萬沒想到，在所有後續的資訊自由法申請中，最熱門的類別會是與不明飛行物相關的文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. And indeed, during the late 1970s, over 10,000 pages of documents relating to UFOs were released.
→ {"text": "事實上，在 1970 年代後期，超過 10，000 頁與不明飛行物相關的文件被解密公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. The party lasted until about 1982 when a presidential order by Ronald Reagan made FOIA substantially less user friendly and did not require many agencies to reply in a timely manner at all.
→ {"text": "這場盛宴持續到 1982 年左右，當時雷根總統的行政命令大幅降低了資訊自由法的友善程度，並且不再要求許多機構及時回應申請。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. The result was a major ballooning in costs to those people making requests.
→ {"text": "結果導致申請者的成本大幅膨脹。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. So the glory era of Freedom of Information documents, at least pertaining to UFOs, came to an end.
→ {"text": "於是資訊自由文件的黃金時代——至少在不明飛行物方面——就此結束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. To this day, more than half of all U.S. declassified UFO documents come from that period of time, over 30 years ago.
→ {"text": "至今，超過半數的美國不明飛行物解密文件都來自那個時期，距今已超過 30 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. Great for the Carter administration, shame on the subsequent ones.
→ {"text": "卡特政府值得讚許，後續的政府則令人遺憾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. And yet we remain fortunate, I think, because the documents that we have, thank goodness, give us at least enough.
→ {"text": "然而我認為我們仍然算幸運，因為我們擁有的這些文件，謝天謝地，至少足夠了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. They give us enough of a history to hold on to.
→ {"text": "它們提供了足夠的歷史資料讓我們能夠掌握。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. They give us enough solid ground.
→ {"text": "它們給了我們足夠堅實的立足點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. And their aggregate message is startlingly clear.
→ {"text": "而它們匯總起來的訊息驚人地清晰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. UFOs have been the subject not merely of interest to our nation's military and intelligence community, but at times a subject of concern and even alarm.
→ {"text": "不明飛行物不僅是我國軍方與情報機構關注的主題，有時更是令他們憂慮甚至驚恐的對象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. But how could it be otherwise when we have report after report of violations of sensitive airspace by objects that defy any logical or conventional explanation, whether the scene was Los Alamos during 1948 and 1949, or Oak Ridge Laboratories from 1948 through much of the 1950s, or the many military bases during the 50s, 60s, and 70s that reported such events.
→ {"text": "當我們有一份又一份關於敏感空域遭不明物體侵犯的報告時，怎能不如此呢？這些物體違反任何邏輯或常規解釋，無論現場是 1948 至 1949 年的 Los Alamos，1948 年至 1950 年代大部分時期的 Oak Ridge 實驗室，或是 1950、1960、1970 年代許多回報此類事件的軍事基地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. The question remains, how could this not be a matter of grave concern to those parties responsible for maintaining the integrity of their airspace?
→ {"text": "問題仍然存在：對於那些負責維護領空完整性的單位而言，這怎麼可能不是嚴重關切的事項？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. And not surprisingly, we find the tone of their memos and requests for information to be appropriate to the matter at hand.
→ {"text": "毫不令人意外的是，我們發現他們的備忘錄與資訊請求的語氣，恰如其分地反映了事態的嚴重性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. Here's one CIA memo from 1949, puts the matter in this very succinct way, quote, "Information is desired if this was some new or experimental aircraft or for any explanation whatsoever."
→ {"text": "這裡有一份 1949 年的 CIA 備忘錄，以非常簡潔的方式陳述此事，引述：「需要取得資訊，確認這是否為某種新型或實驗性飛行器，或任何可能的解釋。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. And these statements are, in fact, typical.
→ {"text": "事實上，這些陳述是典型的寫法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. And the situation became so stressful to the CIA and elsewhere that on December 2nd, 1952, this is right at the very end of the Truman presidency, the CIA's chief of scientific intelligence, H. Marshall Chadwell, wrote a classified memo to his boss, that was the director of the CIA, Walter Bedell Smith.
→ {"text": "情勢變得如此緊迫，以至於 CIA 與其他單位備感壓力。1952 年 12 月 2 日，也就是杜魯門總統任期即將結束之際，CIA 科學情報部門主管 H·馬歇爾·查德威爾向他的上司——CIA 局長沃爾特·比德爾·史密斯——提交了一份機密備忘錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. And a key paragraph in this memo is as follows.
→ {"text": "這份備忘錄中的關鍵段落如下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention.
→ {"text": "「此時，這些事件報告使我們確信，有某些事正在發生，必須立即關注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles, end quote.
→ {"text": "在美國主要國防設施附近，於高海拔處以高速移動的不明物體目擊事件，其性質無法歸因於自然現象或已知類型的飛行器。」引述結束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. I think this is a statement that bears very close scrutiny.
→ {"text": "我認為這段陳述值得我們密切檢視。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. Here is yet another comment by a high-level U.S. official that UFOs were real, probably artificial, probably intelligently operated, and not apparently ours.
→ {"text": "這是另一位高層美國官員的評論，指出不明飛行物是真實的，很可能是人造的，很可能由智慧操控，且顯然不是我們的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. And nor was there serious consideration that these were Soviet.
→ {"text": "也沒有認真考慮過這些是蘇聯的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. So I would ask, if not American, if not Soviet, if not natural phenomena, and if they appeared to be technological and under intelligent control, well, we begin to run out of viable options.
→ {"text": "所以我要問，如果不是美國的，如果不是蘇聯的，如果不是自然現象，而且它們看起來具有技術性且受智慧控制，那麼我們可選擇的合理選項就所剩無幾了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. It is access to documents such as these that enable us to know with certainty that UFOs were a matter of serious concern to individuals at the highest levels of U.S. national security.
→ {"text": "正是因為能夠取得這些文件，我們才能確信，不明飛行物確實是美國國家安全最高層級人士嚴重關切的事項。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. I would want to stress that I don't think any of the formally declassified documents we have by themselves prove that UFOs are ET.
→ {"text": "我想強調，我不認為我們擁有的任何正式解密文件本身能夠證明不明飛行物是外星的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. I don't think any of them do.
→ {"text": "我認為它們都無法證明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. But I would argue that if you take the top 50, even the top 10, that they make a very powerful case, I would say not even a matter of speculation but a matter of proof that the phenomenon was considered real by the responsible members of our national security community.
→ {"text": "但我要說的是，如果你看前 50 份，甚至是前 10 份文件，它們構成了非常有力的論證，我認為這甚至不是推測的問題，而是證明了此現象被我們國家安全機構的負責成員視為真實存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. That I would say is not a matter of debate or speculation.
→ {"text": "我認為這不是辯論或推測的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. And really the questions that we need to ask is why were they considering it, and did they form any opinions themselves?
→ {"text": "我們真正需要問的問題是，他們為何如此重視，以及他們自己是否形成了任何看法？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. Getting at that answer is a little more difficult.
→ {"text": "要得到這個答案會稍微困難一些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. But nonetheless, the bottom line is these documents do prove this.
→ {"text": "但無論如何，底線是這些文件確實證明了這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. And it's important because all of these levels of concern were consistently voiced within the classified world, but they were not given out publicly all through the '40s and '50s.
→ {"text": "這很重要，因為所有這些層級的關切，在整個 1940 年代和 1950 年代，始終在機密世界中被提出，但從未對外公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. Right up to our own era, the formal public statements are always the same, that there's nothing to this, that it may be interesting or may not, but we're not interested in it.
→ {"text": "直到我們這個時代，正式的公開聲明始終如一：沒有這回事，可能有趣也可能沒趣，但我們對此不感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. We don't do UFOs.
→ {"text": "我們不處理不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. And fortunately, as the historical accident of freedom of information turned out, those documents proved the lie to those statements of denial.
→ {"text": "幸運的是，正如資訊自由這場歷史偶然所揭示的，那些文件證明了這些否認聲明是謊言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. So today, official pronouncements about UFOs by the government and military follows the exact same tone.
→ {"text": "所以今日，政府與軍方關於不明飛行物的官方聲明，遵循完全相同的基調。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. There's really no difference between what they say now and what they said 50 years ago, except they're a little less insulting about it.
→ {"text": "他們現在說的話與 50 年前說的話並無真正差異，只是現在稍微不那麼侮辱性了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

59. Like in the early years, there were a number of statements that talked about people just kind of being crazy, psychopathological, that you don't hear that anymore.
→ {"text": "例如早年有許多陳述說人們只是有點瘋狂、有精神病理問題，現在你不會再聽到那樣的話了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. But other than that, it's really the same type of tone.
→ {"text": "但除此之外，基調真的是一樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. Unfortunately, though, that we don't have the kind of access to classified information on UFOs as we once briefly obtained in the past.
→ {"text": "不幸的是，我們不再擁有過去曾短暫取得的那種不明飛行物機密資訊管道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. And yet, enough genuine and recent UFO accounts have become known to us, many of which involve US military, that we can see that very little has changed.
→ {"text": "然而，我們已經知道了足夠多的真實且近期的不明飛行物事件，其中許多涉及美軍，可以看出幾乎沒有任何改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. Something important is happening behind the veil of the classified world.
→ {"text": "在機密世界的面紗背後，正在發生某些重要的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. My question to you is, how long will current members of Congress and the public at large be content to roll over and be spoon-fed nonsense by responsible officials when in fact they deserve the truth?
→ {"text": "我的問題是，當現任國會議員與廣大公眾事實上應得真相時，他們還要忍受多久，繼續被動接受負責官員餵食的無稽之談？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. Good afternoon, or good morning, distinguished members and panelists of the Citizen Hearing on Unidentified Flying Objects, UFOs.
→ {"text": "下午好，或早上好，尊敬的不明飛行物公民聽證會成員與小組成員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. My name is Antonio Huneeus, and I'm a Chilean-American journalist who has been actively involved in covering the mystery of UFOs and its hypothesis of extraterrestrial ET origin.
→ {"text": "我的名字是安東尼奧·胡尼烏斯，我是一名智利裔美國記者，在過去 37 年裡積極參與報導不明飛行物之謎及其外星起源假說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. Other theories are also possible and should be considered for the past 37 years.
→ {"text": "其他理論也是可能的，也應該被考慮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. My very first article on this topic was published in a small New York newspaper on July 4, 1977, coinciding with the beginning of my professional career as a journalist in the United States.

While it's true that the majority of UFO sightings have mundane explanations, a fact recognized by most competent investigators and scientists, if you really study with an open mind the extensive data bank of UFO cases collected worldwide during the last six decades, you will find a small percentage of truly puzzling incidents that defy any conventional explanation.

169. The two security men at the door told me I was not allowed to take any notes, but I actually had a yellow pad under my arm when I went in like this, and so when I went in and when I saw these photographs, what I did is I cranked down the focus on the machine so that I could get a close-up view of these symbols that were around the dome of the UFO, and what I did is I opened up the yellow pad and I put the yellow pad in there and I traced the actual symbols that were along the base of the saucer, and then I closed it up and I said, "I think I'd probably better leave now because I have this."

176. Now, that is what we did, and Father Bill Davis, when I asked him this, he got puzzled and he reached down and he pulled open the drawer out of his desk at the Jesuit headquarters right over by DuPont Circle, 1717 Mass Ave is where we were, and he opened up the drawer and he pulled out a photograph, and he said, "This is a photograph that I got from my sister.

Well, he got the clearance to fire which kind of surprised everybody and he blew that UFO out of the sky, but the problem is that the recording of the incident, well, let me get this exactly right, the UFO intercept violated the prohibited zone at Hanford's Atomic Energy Facility.
