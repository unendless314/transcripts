## Speaker Group 1

362. I would say that there's probably not a person in this room that would not agree with you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. All in all, there's probably a person.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. That is not totally true, what you just said, but I do believe that it would make a huge, huge difference.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. I actually think it would make the people of the world, certainly the people of the United States, even better.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. I think if we had absolute knowledge of these things, peace would be more likely, a unified approach towards really finding out answers of other things to eliminate suffering and disease and everything else would be vastly enhanced.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. I think there's a lot of wonderful good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. I don't necessarily think the United States would slip into second place on anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. I have a little bit of difference with my esteemed colleague from Alaska on that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. I've got to say, I'm impressed with the credentials of the people we've heard from, people with doctorate degrees in medicine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. We have, in other words, two that are clearly at the highest levels of biological science, if they're medical degrees, which I assume Dr. Lear and Dr. Greer have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. I think, Dr. Vallone, I think you're a physicist, as is Dr. Wood in the physical area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. This is a unique opportunity to hear from physical and biological scientists of great stature and qualification, so I'm going to ask Dr. Wood a question that I started to ask the other panel, which I wouldn't have asked if I'd known this panel was this qualified in the area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. One of the biggest concerns of people, one of the biggest reasons why people don't believe that UFOs have extraterrestrial origins is this whole question of the speed of light.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. I'm going to ask Robert Wood, how old or large do you think the universe is?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. You're a physicist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. You've probably thought about these things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. I think the latest estimate is 20 billion years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. About how large is the Milky Way galaxy, which is just a very tiny little, little part of the universe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. I think the diameter is about 50,000 light years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. So 100,000 light years across.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. It used to be, in the books at that time it was 50.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. It's today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. It's considered to be about 100,000.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. So if we only went 10, tell me if I'm right about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. If we were only able to send craft at one-tenth the speed of light, if the universe is 15 or 20 billion years old, which I think you said you'd think, couldn't a spacecraft go from one end of 100,000 light year galaxy to the other end of that galaxy in a period of the time of the, this universe has been in existence 15,000 different times and go back and forth?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. In other words, why is the speed of light such a big problem?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. That's what I'm trying to understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. I'm not trying to say it stops the idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. I'm saying, am I right that a craft could go 15,000 times from one end of the galaxy to the other in the amount of time that's happened?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. We think in terms of our own time, but I'd just like you to respond to that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. Well, I'd like to answer that in two parts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. The first part has to do with the organizational name we are working with, Paradigm Research Group.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. And the idea of paradigm is that the concepts of science get changed suddenly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. And Newton had a paradigm of F equals MA and Einstein came along and said, now that's not quite right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. When you go close to the speed of light, you've got different equations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. And so the old paradigm was overthrown.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. My thought here is that the current paradigm that we have that you can't travel faster than the speed of light is it might be overthrown by what Dr. Vallone had said earlier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. Namely, there's a difference between inertial mass and the meditational mass.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. If we could go the speed of light, it wouldn't be just 15,000 times doing that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. We could do that 150,000 times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. In other words, speed of light isn't really a barrier to interstellar travel, is it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. In my opinion, the speed of light is not a barrier of travel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. That's what I wanted to establish.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. Can I comment on this for a moment?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. Yeah, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. Because one of the areas that I don't know how much has been talked about prior to today is the whole area of trans-dimensional physics.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. So if you're dealing with three-dimensional space or four-dimensional spacetime, you have one set of equations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. But when you deal with very high-voltage systems that cause an alteration in what's called the spin, spin theory, mass, and also inertia, you have another whole set of equations which have not been disclosed yet that then become operative so that you can go from here to the end of our galaxy and back controlling for time on Earth right now in a matter of perhaps minutes or days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. I don't question what you're saying.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. This gets into it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. I'm going to reclaim the time just to say this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. I can believe that we do have, yeah, wormholes may well be true and so forth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. But what I'm trying to say is that the wormhole theories have not been established anywhere near as established as the speed of light and the first relativity theory of Einstein have been established.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. So what I'm trying to say is we don't have to establish, I'm trying to ask you, we don't necessarily have to establish some of these physicists which may well be true that could be established into the future in which there are some interesting indications from even the past that might be happening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. So I'd like to, so will you respond to that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. We run a conference on future energy almost every year now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. It'll be one in July at the University of Maryland again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. We've had David Frohnig there several times as speaker.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. He's a professor from the University of Adelaide in Australia and he particularly has worked on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. He actually has simulations of one time to speed light, five times and so forth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. He treats it just like the sound barrier and he literally has equation comparisons for the speed of sound, speed of light and so forth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. So my emphasis is trying to make it simple and that is the inertial mass is the key to understanding how this is possible and the special relativity equations which I'm very familiar with only deal with inertial mass.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. So if I could recognize my time really quickly, if we start talking about artificial intelligence being involved in the control of certain vehicles as opposed to natural intelligence being in control, couldn't we also overcome some of these barriers that people have been talking about?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. I mean we send artificial intelligence today out into space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. Is that a possibility?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. The advanced extraterrestrial technologies do deal with technologies that cross into the conscious quantum hologram and directed thought and this is amazing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. I got to be clear, I hate to cut you off but my time has expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. I can't violate what I'm making everybody else live by.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. But we will now go to Congresswoman Wilsey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. The first thing I want to do is thank you all for adding an even deeper level of credibility to this hearing that we've had this week.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. The subject of ufology is so out there that we have to, many of us have to just know that because of who you are, what we're doing is what we should be doing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. So speaking of what we should be doing, my question to each of you to answer in the time we have is where do you believe that the United States ranks in preparation to meet the global needs for the future?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. And where will the brilliant students that will become adults like yourselves, only some of them have to be women, come from to meet the numbers we're going to need?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. Well, when you asked the question, my immediate reaction was when you said the United States, I asked myself who's really in charge of the answer to your question?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. And so I think the issue which we're dealing with is a truth embargo issue and this enormous secrecy which controls and dominates our entire process, maybe even including the educational process, but if you talk about the ordinary world that we mostly, most of us think that we live in, clearly we need to establish the ideas that new ideas, the discoveries as Stan Friedman said, come from doing things differently in an unpredictable way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. So I think we need to emphasize the importance of creativity in developing the next set of equations that we need and may have already been discovered, but we need to make our society better and stronger.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. Well, I think we already have everything we need to create a sustainable, poverty-free world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. It's already extant and this is very good news.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. The very bad news is that there is a ruthless, deep national security state that the people I have worked with have run into that is this massive buzzsaw.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. And I think that at a certain point, we the people and the Congress and the United Nations and other countries have to come together and say, we've had enough of this nonsense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. And I do not think this is going to come from an executive order from the President.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. I think it's going to come from people stepping forward and I wish to emphasize that as I did the other day, that in 1998 we declared these unacknowledged special access projects unconstitutional, a priori illegal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. And we encouraged and we now have over 500 people who have come forward to give us information documents and what have you on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. And I think we need to continue to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. I think we have to say to people who are really not responsive to the people that this is still a world of liberty and we have to be free to know the truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. Very good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. Dr. Vallone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. Could I show slide 23, please, as I'm talking?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. What I'd like to explain is that I agree with our co-panelists and that is the United States already has this technology and I had the privilege of talking with a former black project engineer, spent the whole afternoon with him taking pages and pages of notes, one of which is actually in front of me right here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. And what I learned is, first of all, he taught me all the details of creating an electro-gravitic layered semiconductor that with bismuth in between and magnesium and zinc, with the same percentages that when slide 23 pops up, you'll see that was published years before in a colleague's book called Secrets of Anti-Gravity Propulsion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. And Dr. Paul Violette only let me know a year later, he said, "Oh, this sounds like what I learned from another black project engineer who actually was through Aviation Weekly over in England."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. So this is very interesting because my contact told me so many things I couldn't believe, I just took the notes down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. But after I corroborated this with Linda Moulton-Hull's artifact as well, we have three different corroborations within 1% variation of the same artifact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. In fact, slide 24, if she gets that up, will also show the actual semiconductor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. But the important part is that we have the technology, students are contacting our Integrity Research Institute all the time saying, "What should we study?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. And this is, I used to be a college teacher, you need the 13 chapters with questions and answers at the end of each chapter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. And the books need to be written, the Zero Point Energy book, the Electro-Vitics book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. These textbooks are the textbooks of the future and the students are already there waiting to study this stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. So this is the book I'm talking about and if we progress to the next slide, we'll see the actual page that Paul was talking about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. And this to me was amazing synchronicity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. So I started to believe the other stuff that this black project fellow told me, and that is we already have a base on Mars, which was established in the 1970s, and I said, "Oh, I don't believe that."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. He says, "Oh, go check the NASA records of the greenhouse gases from Mars' atmosphere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. They increased in the 1970s."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. And that was his counterpoint and so forth, he says, "We have a deep space platform."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. He even gave me a jaw dropper and that was the Gulf Breeze UFO conferences that almost amazingly always had a UFO sighting during the conference.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. He says, "I know the guy who ran that craft, it was a back to engineered craft and he just did it for fun, fly over the UFO conference and create some stir."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. So this is the kind of problem we have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. These boys with toys.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. Thank you, Dr. Lark.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. I have a different approach.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

484. I'm very pessimistic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. I believe that the knowledge, the basic knowledge of all this having to do with the, we've been using the term extraterrestriality as a more general term than it should be used because we really don't understand the entire ramifications of the universe itself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. We don't know whether this is a multiverse, whether there are various time areas involved, but someone does know and I believe that at one time at the days of Majestic 12 and Eisenhower and Truman and so on and the state that the world was in, it was necessary to keep this a secret from the public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. But now I believe, again, I'm sorry to be pessimistic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. I believe this has moved on from governments, the United States government or any other government into the hands of a greedy industrial complex that does not want it to change.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. Time has expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. We'll now go to Representative Barton.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

492. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. Because I want our deliberations to be most favorably perceived, I have one little question I'd like to get cleared up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. I understand that a bit ago there was a petition being circulated in one of our communities suggesting that the city water work should stop putting dihydrooxide into the water system because if in the future it was determined to be hazardous to health, it could never be removed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. Dihydrooxide, of course, is water and it's true that if you put it in there, it can never be removed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. My question has to do with a comment that was made both yesterday and the day before that we're looking at getting energy from water.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. Now I'd always thought of water as the ash you get when you burn hydrogen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. So I'm wondering what am I missing here?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

499. Unless you're talking about nuclear energy, I'm having some trouble understanding how you get chemical energy from an ash.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

500. Can you help clear this up for the record?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. I can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

502. And we did a great deal of research on this and actually have a proposal that I've given to the chairman for you to look at.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

503. Stan Meyer and other people have found that using very high voltage systems at certain resonant frequencies causes a recruitment of energy from the ambient zero point energy field that was spoken about so that you can break the hydrogen-oxygen bond.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. So you have two gases that you can burn and when you burn it, the only effluent is water vapor because it recombines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. Now this is actually was done and it was operational and fortunately Stan Meyer died under mysterious conditions and he took those secrets to his grave.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. His twin brother is still living and people who work with him are still living.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. There are a number of them want to work with us in an R&D project to do this so we convert the internal combustion engines we have now to water engines and this is not a pipe dream.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

508. This is actually something that can be done.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

509. So my next question, sir, I can believe that they did this, but unless they're violating the second law of thermodynamics, which I don't think we think that you can violate, there's going to be less energy come out than you put into splitting the molecule?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. That's the whole point of what's called an over-unity system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. Maybe this didn't get covered, is that you're setting up an electromagnetic pointing vector.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. And we can violate the second law of thermodynamics?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. No, sir, no, because there's constant conservation of energy, but there's another energy field that hasn't been accounted for, some may call it the Higgs field now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. Thank you for getting this in the record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. So there is absolutely no violation of the second law of thermodynamics, none at all, and that's a very important thing to understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. You're actually taking energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. It's been estimated that every cubic centimeter of space in this room has enough energy to run the earth for a day if you could tap it properly through these systems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

518. So that means the energy is there, but you have to be able to create a vector into that energy field.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. The zero-point energy field he's talking about, the quantum vacuum, in other words.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

520. Okay, I just want to clear it up, because I think many people understand chemistry as I do, that water is the ash you get when you burn hydrogen, and it's hard to get energy out of ash, so thank you for clearing that up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. I think that there's a general consensus that if these UFOs are real and if they're extraterrestrial, that they somehow have learned to do what we would love to be able to do, and that is have an anti-gravity thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. Okay, I don't know how much we know by reverse engineering these things, how much we know about that, but whatever we know about it, do you think that information is being made available to Stephen Hawking?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. I haven't heard he died, so I guess he's still alive, and people like him who are trying to harmonize the mysteries of the universe, relativity and gravity and so forth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. Do you think it's being, I hope it's being made available to them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. You think not?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. If you're talking about black project discoveries from back engineering, no, I'm sorry, it's the same as in the government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

527. They're all in the dark, and they literally are opposed to anything that would violate their little classical laws of physics that they're used to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

528. I know I've dealt with professors all my life, and unfortunately it's a big dichotomy between the ivory towers that they sit in and the black project guys that say, "Hey, the laws of physics need to be rewritten," and that exact quote has been used many times for those investigating the black world, it's literally called.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. It's not just the laws of physics that have to be rewritten, the laws of physiology have to be rewritten, because if there are entities in these craft, the maneuvers they make, we couldn't survive it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

530. Yes, we can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. That's what I tried to explain in my slideshow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. I'd be glad to pull up slide 18 again and slide 17.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. This is a very important discovery that's been made, and I'm one of the few that have put these things together to describe 17, which is the inertial inertia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. In other words, inertial mass is now known to be a zero-point energy effect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. The slide you're looking at right here is slide 18, that's the conclusion of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. The previous one, 17, is the journal article that is probably front-page news and should be, because once inertia now is discovered to be an electromagnetic phenomenon, that's an exact breakthrough, in other words.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. If we go back one slide, the journal article obviously is something we need to refer to, because Hal Puthoff was responsible for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. Bernie Hayes, who I know personally, was also responsible, and they proved it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

539. They literally did stochastic electrodynamics to conclude that it's simply a Lorentz force, F equals V cross B. And if you know what I'm talking about, V cross B, velocity crossing with a magnetic field gives you a force, and you see that in electromagnetism.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. But who would know you could see that in a movement of a vehicle?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. But you do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

542. Because you're moving to the right, you want to turn to the right, and your body is going to the left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. That's the Lorentz force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. That's exactly what you see in electromagnetism, and now we find that it's in vehicular movement as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

545. So therefore, this is an interaction between the zero-point field, which is all around us, and the individual electromagnetism of your body, of the craft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

546. And exactly that means shielding is possible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. And once the shielding is possible, you've got all time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. My time has expired, thank you so much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. Now I'd like to go to our new questioner, Dr. Bookman, who, by the way, ran for Congress from my state not too many years ago, five or six years ago, I believe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. Not against Merrill, though, against your colleague, Rob Bishop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. Dr. Greer, you mentioned 25-mile wide craft. 26. 26-mile wide craft, and you mentioned that you believe the military-industrial complex has a program of shooting them down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

552. Have we shot down one that big, in your opinion, or from your witnesses?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

554. To my knowledge, those have not been targeted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

555. We do have witnesses, and there is a number of testimonies from pilots where attempts to target and bring them down have occurred.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

556. And I think that we have to understand that $2.3 trillion in unaccounted funds in the military-industrial complex have resulted in some very strange things going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

557. I call it the Strangelovian complex, where there are folks who are doing things without proper oversight from the Congress or the President that are really a threat to our national security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

558. The briefing I did for the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, General Patrick Hughes, really focused on this, and I have never spoken of this publicly until now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

559. But the big concern was, is that there was a cabal, or deep national security operation, of which he knew nothing and did not control, that was doing some rather dangerous things that could endanger not only our nation, but the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. And I think this is an existential threat to not only world peace, and I think we have to start thinking not just of world peace, but of interplanetary relations and universal peace.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

561. But to get more specific, there are portable EMP, electromagnetic pulse systems, and others that involve scalar or longitudinal waves that are, as opposed to a light wave that moves like this, or longitudinal, that have been weaponized.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

562. And as Werner von Braun stated in the last years of his life through our disclosure project witness Carol Rosin, that these sort of technologies are being deployed in this space and should not be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

563. Moreover, there's a number of false flag operations that have happened, as was referred to in Gulf Breeze, where there have been objects that appear to be ET that aren't, and contact events that appear to be alien that aren't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

564. And these include the manufacturer at EG&G near the Nellis range of a number of implants.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

565. As you know from our witness, Mr. Pollock, who worked with the CIA, they were manufacturing up to two billion of these in the '70s and '80s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

566. This interview is on YouTube.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

567. There's a number of things I have not had time to go into that I really do believe are an existential threat to our planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. And I wish we had time to go into them now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

570. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

571. Maybe on the break.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

572. I'd like to speed up on this too, if I'm doing my dual job correctly, I have about three minutes left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

573. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

574. Somebody time me and cut me off, or I'll go forever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

575. Thank you for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

576. If I understand correctly, Linda Moulton-Hal, George Knapp, Dolan, yourself, have had conversations with people deep in the military industrial complex who've told you things off the record privately.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

577. It would make a great movie, I gather.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

578. By the way, Disclosure, the serious movie, is a great movie as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

579. If the United States Congress, or what would you need, what do you feel they would need from the United States Congress in order to be able to feel safe testifying on 60 Minutes or somewhere?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

580. I mean, I appreciate your point, Dr. Lear, and others have made this, that we have an oath to the Constitution, not to some independent agency that's gotten out of control.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

582. What would it take for those people to be free to their secrecy oaths such that they could appear in the media publicly on these issues?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

583. Well, I think the question is, would the media even allow it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

584. As I mentioned, when ABC News wanted to do this, with 35 digital hours of top secret testimony, Ira Rosen was shot down by corporate ABC.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

585. That's one question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

586. The other question becomes, I think some of these people, and the briefing I put together for the president that went to him via John Podesta, Center for American Progress, was oriented towards getting those executive actions done, because we need federal, martial protection for some of these people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

587. I know who they are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

588. I'm holding their documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

589. It's part of, I hate to say this, part of my dead man trigger.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. If anything happens to me, it'll hit the internet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

591. I'm probably more valuable alive than dead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

592. I hope you stay that way, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

593. Well, from the point of view of keeping the secrecy there, but I'm not going to violate people's confidentialities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

594. What I will say is that there's an enormous amount of actionable intelligence we have, and names can be provided, including members of this majestic committee with whom I've met.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. Many of them would like to see this information come out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

596. The problem is lethal force has been threatened and used.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

597. I think that this has become something that needs an FBI investigation, Congressional investigation, and subpoenas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

598. I have one minute left if I've timed myself correctly here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

599. I'll do this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

600. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

601. Are you saying there's nothing Congress can do to pass legislation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

602. When I ran for Congress, I called for legislation protecting whistleblowers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

603. This administration has been prosecuting whistleblowers like crazy, and I said, "We need to protect whistleblowers on waste, fraud, criminal activity, and the UFO issue," and all the media focused on in my campaign was ridiculing me over UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

604. Thank you, media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

605. Is there anything Congress could do such that those people would feel safe?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

606. Yes, they can issue subpoenas, and they can also require the Federal Marshal Protective Services to protect them, and they would be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

607. I think that this is something that can be done if there was the will and the intent within the Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

608. Barring that, I think we've brought out as many people as we can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

609. One of my frustrations is knowing too many people and having too much information that I can't give actual intelligence on to the general public without violating ... I take this like a doctor with patient confidentiality, without protecting those people's confidentiality, but we have this information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

610. I would love to be subpoenaed so I could give it over to a proper authority.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

611. I've heard that from George Knapp and others as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

612. You're not alone in that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

613. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

614. There are a lot of witnesses that Protective would come out, and with that I see my time is up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

615. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

616. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

617. Thank you, Dr. Berkman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

618. We'll now go to Senator Grevelle.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

619. I am not qualified to get into the technical discussion, but I would say this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

620. Dr. Wood referred to, if the black area has this knowledge, you've pointed out that whoever was the head of the CIA at the time shut the door on ... Dr. Valone, we've heard testimony before about the fact that somebody was boasting from one of these black areas, which is these contractors that we have the capability to take ET back home.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

621. Is that something briefly squares with your knowledge at this point in time?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

622. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

623. That's a quote from the former CEO of Lockheed, I believe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

624. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

625. Ben Rich.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

626. Ben Rich.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

627. It's a famous quote.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

628. It's true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

629. I would agree with it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

630. If you think that's believable, and that's a quote from the head of a corporation, this is criminal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

631. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

632. Because we go back to what Dr. Grevelle was saying, that we have the capability of sharing this technology and freeing up the world to an unbelievable level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

633. We stand capable of indicting, in the area of public opinion, the head of what?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

634. Lockheed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

635. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

636. That's right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

637. Skunkworks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

638. He knew what he was talking about, because he had all the countries ...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

639. That's fine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

640. I'll accept that he knows what he's talking about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

641. He's depriving the world of possible advancement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

642. Here, all of you, all four of you, you interface with scientists in a whole black area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

643. You're trying to talk.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

644. Where's their moral content?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

645. Well, I can answer that if you ... Where is it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

646. They've got a hole somewhere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

647. Ben Rich wrote a book, and he specifically described the sundown rule.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

648. I wrote about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

649. It's on our website.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

650. It's one of the recommendations we have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

651. The sundown rule should be enforced, and that is classified, fine, how many years?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

652. You have to put a time limit on every classified document, and therefore, it's going down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

653. The sun's going down in 10 years, and it becomes free, and the public gets access to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

654. Right now, we have about 50 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

655. Fine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

656. Well, I've got to tell you, the Congress has tried to put that kind of a rule in on the laws, and it's never worked.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

657. I know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

658. Well, this is why I think ...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

659. Good luck in your field.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

660. It's at least one solution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

661. Well, this is why I think, in the tradition of Martin Luther King, in the tradition of Susan B. Anthony, in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson, we should say, "The hell with these games."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

662. People who know this, I believe, as you said, have a moral obligation to our children and our grandchildren to step forward with the truth, with the technology, and with the information, because there is a criminal national security deep state that has basically thumbed its nose at the Constitution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

663. For that reason, there is no justification for the continued secrecy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

664. I think that one of the things all of us as citizens have to decide is whether we're going to do that or not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

665. Could it be risky?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

666. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

667. Do we have to make sacrifices?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

668. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

669. But part of it gets into ... Everybody puts their pants on one leg at a time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

670. I was talking to the Deputy Director of the National Science Foundation, and I turned to him and I said, "We really need your help getting this information, this technology out."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

671. He says, "Yes, I'd love to, but it'd be the end of my career."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

672. I said, "Okay, on one hand, we have the fate of the future of humanity, on the other hand, we have your career."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

673. Your selfish career.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

674. Your selfish career.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

675. I saw your film the other night, and I want to compliment you on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

676. I thought that was awesome, but let me just ... I think I said it in an earlier day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

677. Nobody questions authority anymore.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

678. The whole population is gutless, and we've had ourselves on the back that we're so wonderful, we're the leaders of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

679. My God, we are stifling the ability of the world to go forward, and we put that aside because we're questioning our patriotism.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

680. Well, we need to question our patriotism.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

681. I want to give one example, when the Pentagon Papers was sent over to the House and the Senate, they were put under guard and a member could only go in and read them and couldn't take any notes, and I was 42 years old.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

682. When I was 23 years old, I could classify top secret documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

683. Are we not at a situation where it's absolutely ridiculous?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

684. Then after they were released, it was moot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

685. The Supreme Court was made moot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

686. The Congress was made moot, and the decision was made that any member of Congress can release any information of all these secrets, and it hasn't happened since 1972.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

687. The indictment is on us as a Congress, and that's the reason why when the whole purpose of this hearing was, "We'll take this to Congress and have another hearing," boy, that's just taking the issue and putting it on a shelf forever, and it just won't happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

688. I'll yield for a question or a statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

689. I just wanted to say the sunset rules actually are in effect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

690. The Brady gun laws sunset it after five years, and then it wasn't continued.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

691. We never went back and visited it, so it's there when, and it depends on the issue, and it depends on who's in the leadership.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

692. The sunset principle is Congress has the ability to go back and see anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

693. We have an oversight capacity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

694. If there's one activity in the Congress that's not dealt with properly is our oversight capacity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

695. I couldn't agree with you more, and in fact, when I met with oversight, for example, Congressman Dan Burton, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee who were in office, they were very interested, but what I have found, there's a disconnect between what people want to know and what people want to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

696. There's a fear of touching this subject because of the ridicule factor and other reasons, and I think we just have to become more courageous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

697. And also know what you want to ask for, for declassification.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

698. I'd like to meet with you later, anyways.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

699. Could I mention there's an Office of Declassification in College Park, Maryland.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

700. That's where the official federal government Office of Declassification is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

701. It's solicitable, you can approach them, and if you know what to ask for, that's the key, then you can ask for it to be declassified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

702. Your time is not quite expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

703. I see the sign right there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

704. It's already stopped.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

705. Oh, it just expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

706. There it goes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

707. That's why he stopped.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

708. You used up my time asking questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

709. Now we'll go to Representative Patrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

710. Now I'm questioning now, right, as I understand it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

711. Yes, you're questioning now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

712. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

713. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

714. Excellent panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

715. Excellent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

716. Way over my head.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

717. I did see serious the other night, which is also way over my head, but I got parts of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

718. And the whole week has helped me get more and more.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

719. But your sitting here today brings back for me the validity, the intelligence, and the necessity of moving forward with this incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

720. It's just you got to have to do it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

721. And you all have provided, without even saying it as an introduction, the technology that exists in the world that we don't now yet display that we have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

722. We may have it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

723. We don't display that we do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

724. It's a real critical concern to our national security and to other things, so I want to commend you for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

725. I think that's excellent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

726. Dr. Lear, I want to go to you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

727. You talked about removing 16 objects from people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

728. I think in my reading preparation that was called implantation, and I might have that wrong.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

729. Is that the right word?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

730. That is absolutely correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

731. Oh, good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

732. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

733. Hey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

734. I'm learning something here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

735. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

736. Then when you -- and it also is related to people who have been implanted with something, can you describe that it was a different kind of material that didn't meet the usual, which means to me it came from somewhere else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

737. Is that correct?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

738. That's correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

739. I submitted to the committee a set of scientific documents that show some of the latest work and findings that we find in the material science of these objects, but I want to point out, too, to my shock, absolute shock, was a paper that was given to me through the Freedom of Information Act in which it describes all my work in the OSTP in the White House given to President Obama at the time he was trying to raise money for the medical care bill.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

740. And the individual that wrote the article stated that if my work was not correct, or the work done by my team was not correct, and that it was secret work that was done by some governmental agency, this also should be released to the public because it would save billions of dollars in health care.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

741. And what is the implication?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

742. Break that down for me, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

743. Well, if we took just the fact that there is no inflammatory response of these objects and no rejection of these objects, you can see that you could take anything that we use medically, a pin, a screw, a nail, a heart, a kidney, any organ, place it into the body.

744. The body would not reject it, and the individual would not have to be on very expensive anti-rejection medication for the rest of their lives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

745. Now, that has nothing to do at all with the material science associated with these objects that we have found here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

746. This is a very advanced nanotechnology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

747. These are nanotechnological devices in which nanocarbon tubes, either single or double wall, I won't go into the whole explanation, but they can be elongated and weaved into carbon nanofibers, carbon nanostrands, and they end in crystalline structures, which are what we call orthorhombic, which are regular rectangular structures.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

748. And we have to remember that in the early days when I was a child, radio, and you got a crystal set with a battery and an air phone, and you were able to get a radio station, that was a marvel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

749. So here's a very, very advanced, and when I say nanotechnological, I'm talking about things that are on a level of the size of an atom.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

750. Using the principle elements of certain materials, putting them together in such a way so that you're actually broadcasting or switching what we perceive as a radio wave, which may not be a radio wave.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

751. It could be scalar technology, which when reaches our electromagnetic spectrum is converted to a radio wave harmonic, which I know is a little bit complex, but it is sending information to somebody.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

752. So somebody out there is listening to something going on in our bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

753. Now we know that even John Glenn, when he went into space originally, complained on public television that he had to swallow implants because this was vital information needed on the physiology of the body to know what was going on in space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

754. And so therefore, your conclusion, you and your team, as it relates to healthcare, as it relates to our country, as it relates to our budget, and to our phenomenon topic we've been talking about today, what do you conclude?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

755. Well, I conclude that if there was funding, at least funding, or open-mindedness from the scientific community, which there is not, because they also pray to higher masters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

756. They don't want to lose their jobs, they have families to feed, they don't want to look at this stuff in the way that we've looked at it for the benefit of mankind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

757. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

758. If we can bring up slide 25, I would like to show 25, 26, and 27 very quickly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

759. And it is, scalar waves are hugely important, because what Dr. Lear just mentioned is a big, another overcoming of the speed of light problem with electromagnetic waves traveling so slow, there's no communication possible across the Milky Way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

760. Well, it turns out there is, and this is a proof of it, the Chilbolton Crop Circle.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

761. Based on the Arecibo message that was sent out in 1974, we all of a sudden have this amazing phenomenon that shows a scalar generator, antenna, right at the bottom of the diagram that copies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

762. This diagram actually is the original one that was sent out in 1974 from Arecibo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

763. It's a digital message that was sent out with the most powerful telescope available at the time, thanks to Frank Drake's study program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

764. In what happened in 1990, I don't have the exact date here, 2001, August 2001, next slide, there was an appearance of the crop circle overnight right next to a radio telescope in Chilbolton, England.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

765. And the amazing thing was it wasn't just a regular crop circle.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

766. This thing had almost exactly the same one-to-one correspondence to the Arecibo message.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

767. Slide 26, please, and then slide 27.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

768. And that's exactly what the thing looked like, the crop circle is just a bunch of crops that are down or up, and then the next one is 27.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

769. And we see at the bottom of 27, instead of the Arecibo antenna, which is a parabolic dish, we're seeing something that looks like two circular objects that literally, it says a change in transmitter diameter from one of the online commentaries on Chilbolton.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

770. And the very bottom is something that describes a scalar broadcast antenna that is actually the answer to instantaneous communication across the Milky Way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

771. Enough said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

772. This is a big breakthrough.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

773. Thank you.
