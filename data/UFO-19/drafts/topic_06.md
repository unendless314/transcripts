## Speaker Group 1

362. I would say that there's probably not a person in this room that would not agree with you.
→ {"text": "我想在座各位應該沒有人會不同意您的看法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. All in all, there's probably a person.
→ {"text": "總體而言，應該是這樣的。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語境較模糊"}

364. That is not totally true, what you just said, but I do believe that it would make a huge, huge difference.
→ {"text": "您剛才說的並不完全正確，但我確實相信這會帶來巨大的改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. I actually think it would make the people of the world, certainly the people of the United States, even better.
→ {"text": "我實際上認為這會讓全世界的人民，當然也包括美國人民，變得更好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. I think if we had absolute knowledge of these things, peace would be more likely, a unified approach towards really finding out answers of other things to eliminate suffering and disease and everything else would be vastly enhanced.
→ {"text": "我認為如果我們能完全了解這些事物，和平將更有可能實現，採取統一的方式來尋找消除苦難、疾病及其他問題的答案也將大大增強。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. I think there's a lot of wonderful good.
→ {"text": "我認為這會帶來許多美好的益處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. I don't necessarily think the United States would slip into second place on anything.
→ {"text": "我不一定認為美國會在任何方面淪為第二名。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. I have a little bit of difference with my esteemed colleague from Alaska on that.
→ {"text": "在這一點上，我與來自阿拉斯加的尊敬同事有些不同的看法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. I've got to say, I'm impressed with the credentials of the people we've heard from, people with doctorate degrees in medicine.
→ {"text": "我必須說，我對我們所聽到的證人的資歷印象深刻，他們都是擁有醫學博士學位的人士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. We have, in other words, two that are clearly at the highest levels of biological science, if they're medical degrees, which I assume Dr. Lear and Dr. Greer have.
→ {"text": "換句話說，我們有兩位顯然處於生物科學最高層次的專家，如果他們擁有醫學學位的話，我假設萊爾博士和格里爾博士都有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. I think, Dr. Vallone, I think you're a physicist, as is Dr. Wood in the physical area.
→ {"text": "我想，瓦隆博士，您是物理學家，伍德博士在物理領域也是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. This is a unique opportunity to hear from physical and biological scientists of great stature and qualification, so I'm going to ask Dr. Wood a question that I started to ask the other panel, which I wouldn't have asked if I'd known this panel was this qualified in the area.
→ {"text": "這是一個獨特的機會，能夠聽取具有崇高地位和資格的物理與生物科學家的證詞，所以我要問伍德博士一個問題，這個問題我原本想問另一個小組，但如果我知道這個小組在這個領域如此專業，我就不會問了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

374. One of the biggest concerns of people, one of the biggest reasons why people don't believe that UFOs have extraterrestrial origins is this whole question of the speed of light.
→ {"text": "人們最大的疑慮之一，也是人們不相信不明飛行物具有外星起源的最大原因之一，就是光速這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. I'm going to ask Robert Wood, how old or large do you think the universe is?
→ {"text": "我要問羅伯特·伍德，您認為宇宙有多大年齡或多麼遼闊？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. You're a physicist.
→ {"text": "您是物理學家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. You've probably thought about these things.
→ {"text": "您可能思考過這些問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. I think the latest estimate is 20 billion years.
→ {"text": "我認為最新的估計是200億年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. About how large is the Milky Way galaxy, which is just a very tiny little, little part of the universe.
→ {"text": "那麼銀河系有多大呢？它只是宇宙中非常非常微小的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. I think the diameter is about 50,000 light years.
→ {"text": "我認為直徑大約是5萬光年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. So 100,000 light years across.
→ {"text": "所以是橫跨10萬光年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

384. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. It used to be, in the books at that time it was 50.
→ {"text": "以前，在那個時候的書裡是5萬。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. It's today.
→ {"text": "現在是。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語境不完整"}

388. It's considered to be about 100,000.
→ {"text": "現在認為大約是10萬光年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. So if we only went 10, tell me if I'm right about this.
→ {"text": "所以如果我們只達到十分之一的光速，請告訴我這樣說對不對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. If we were only able to send craft at one-tenth the speed of light, if the universe is 15 or 20 billion years old, which I think you said you'd think, couldn't a spacecraft go from one end of 100,000 light year galaxy to the other end of that galaxy in a period of the time of the, this universe has been in existence 15,000 different times and go back and forth?
→ {"text": "如果我們只能以十分之一的光速發射飛行器，而宇宙有150億或200億年的歷史，正如您所說，一艘太空船難道不能在宇宙存在的這段時間裡，在這個10萬光年的星系中往返1萬5千次嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. In other words, why is the speed of light such a big problem?
→ {"text": "換句話說，為什麼光速會是這麼大的問題？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. That's what I'm trying to understand.
→ {"text": "這正是我想了解的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. I'm not trying to say it stops the idea.
→ {"text": "我不是說這會阻止這個想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. I'm saying, am I right that a craft could go 15,000 times from one end of the galaxy到另一端 in the amount of time that's happened?
→ {"text": "我是說，一艘飛行器在這段時間裡可以從星系的一端飛到另一端1萬5千次，我這樣說對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. We think in terms of our own time, but I'd just like you to respond to that.
→ {"text": "我們是以自己的時間來思考，但我只是想請您回應這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. Well, I'd like to answer that in two parts.
→ {"text": "嗯，我想分兩部分來回答這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. The first part has to do with the organizational name we are working with, Paradigm Research Group.
→ {"text": "第一部分與我們合作的組織名稱有關，即範式研究小組（Paradigm Research Group）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. And the idea of paradigm is that the concepts of science get changed suddenly.
→ {"text": "範式的概念是指科學觀念會突然發生改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. And Newton had a paradigm of F equals MA and Einstein came along and said, now that's not quite right.
→ {"text": "牛頓提出了F等於MA的範式，而愛因斯坦出現後說，這不完全正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. When you go close to the speed of light, you've got different equations.
→ {"text": "當你接近光速時，你就會有不同的方程式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. And so the old paradigm was overthrown.
→ {"text": "因此，舊的範式被推翻了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. My thought here is that the current paradigm that we have that you can't travel faster than the speed of light is it might be overthrown by what Dr. Vallone had said earlier.
→ {"text": "我的想法是，我們目前認為無法超越光速的範式，可能會被瓦隆博士先前所說的內容推翻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. Namely, there's a difference between inertial mass and the meditational mass.
→ {"text": "也就是說，慣性質量和重力質量之間存在差異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. If we could go the speed of light, it wouldn't be just 15,000 times doing that.
→ {"text": "如果我們能達到光速，那就不只是1萬5千次那麼簡單了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. We could do that 150,000 times.
→ {"text": "我們可以做到15萬次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. In other words, speed of light isn't really a barrier to interstellar travel, is it?
→ {"text": "換句話說，光速並不是星際旅行的真正障礙，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. In my opinion, the speed of light is not a barrier of travel.
→ {"text": "在我看來，光速並不是旅行的障礙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. That's what I wanted to establish.
→ {"text": "這正是我想要確立的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. Can I comment on this for a moment?
→ {"text": "我可以就此發表一下意見嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. Yeah, please.
→ {"text": "好的，請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. Because one of the areas that I don't know how much has been talked about prior to today is the whole area of trans-dimensional physics.
→ {"text": "因為有一個領域，我不知道今天之前討論了多少，那就是跨維度物理學（trans-dimensional physics）的整個領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. So if you're dealing with three-dimensional space or four-dimensional spacetime, you have one set of equations.
→ {"text": "所以，如果你處理的是三維空間或四維時空，你有一套方程式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. But when you deal with very high-voltage systems that cause an alteration in what's called the spin, spin theory, mass, and also inertia, you have another whole set of equations which have not been disclosed yet that then become operative so that you can go from here to the end of our galaxy and back controlling for time on Earth right now in a matter of perhaps minutes or days.
→ {"text": "但是當你處理非常高壓的系統時，這些系統會導致所謂的自旋、自旋理論、質量以及慣性發生改變，你就會有另一整套尚未公開的方程式開始運作，這樣你就可以從這裡到我們星系的盡頭再返回，控制地球現在的時間，可能只需要幾分鐘或幾天。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. I don't question what you're saying.
→ {"text": "我並不質疑您所說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. This gets into it.
→ {"text": "這就涉及到這個問題了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. I'm going to reclaim the time just to say this.
→ {"text": "我要收回發言時間只是為了說這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. I can believe that we do have, yeah, wormholes may well be true and so forth.
→ {"text": "我可以相信我們確實有，是的，蟲洞可能是真實的等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. But what I'm trying to say is that the wormhole theories have not been established anywhere near as established as the speed of light and the first relativity theory of Einstein have been established.
→ {"text": "但我想說的是，蟲洞理論的確立程度遠不如光速和愛因斯坦的第一個相對論那樣被確立。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. So what I'm trying to say is we don't have to establish, I'm trying to ask you, we don't necessarily have to establish some of these physicists which may well be true that could be established into the future in which there are some interesting indications from even the past that might be happening.
→ {"text": "所以我想說的是，我們不必去確立，我是想問您，我們不一定必須去確立這些物理學家中的一些理論，這些理論可能是真實的，可能在未來被確立，而且過去甚至有一些有趣的跡象可能正在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. So I'd like to, so will you respond to that?
→ {"text": "所以我想，您會回應這個問題嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. We run a conference on future energy almost every year now.
→ {"text": "我們現在幾乎每年都舉辦未來能源會議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. It'll be one in July at the University of Maryland again.
→ {"text": "今年七月將再次在馬里蘭大學舉行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. We've had David Frohnig there several times as speaker.
→ {"text": "我們曾多次邀請大衛·弗羅尼格（David Frohnig）擔任演講者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. He's a professor from the University of Adelaide in Australia and he particularly has worked on this.
→ {"text": "他是澳大利亞阿德萊德大學的教授，特別從事這方面的研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. He actually has simulations of one time to speed light, five times and so forth.
→ {"text": "他實際上有關於一倍光速、五倍光速等等的模擬。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. He treats it just like the sound barrier and he literally has equation comparisons for the speed of sound, speed of light and so forth.
→ {"text": "他將其視為音障一樣，他確實有關於聲速、光速等的方程式比較。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. So my emphasis is trying to make it simple and that is the inertial mass is the key to understanding how this is possible and the special relativity equations which I'm very familiar with only deal with inertial mass.
→ {"text": "所以我的重點是試圖簡化這個問題，那就是慣性質量（inertial mass）是理解這如何成為可能的關鍵，而我很熟悉的狹義相對論方程式只涉及慣性質量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. So if I could recognize my time really quickly, if we start talking about artificial intelligence being involved in the control of certain vehicles as opposed to natural intelligence being in control, couldn't we also overcome some of these barriers that people have been talking about?
→ {"text": "所以如果我很快就能認識到這一點，如果我們開始談論人工智能參與某些飛行器的控制，而不是自然智能在控制，我們難道不能也克服人們一直在談論的一些障礙嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. I mean we send artificial intelligence today out into space.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，今天我們將人工智能送入太空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. Is that a possibility?
→ {"text": "這是一種可能性嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. The advanced extraterrestrial technologies do deal with technologies that cross into the conscious quantum hologram and directed thought and this is amazing.
→ {"text": "先進的外星技術確實涉及跨越到有意識的量子全息圖和定向思維的技術，這令人驚嘆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. I got to be clear, I hate to cut you off but my time has expired.
→ {"text": "我必須說清楚，我不想打斷您，但我的時間已經到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. I can't violate what I'm making everybody else live by.
→ {"text": "我不能違反我要求其他人遵守的規則。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. But we will now go to Congresswoman Wilsey.
→ {"text": "但我們現在要請威爾西眾議員發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. The first thing I want to do is thank you all for adding an even deeper level of credibility to this hearing that we've had this week.
→ {"text": "我想做的第一件事是感謝你們所有人，為我們本週舉行的聽證會增添了更深層次的可信度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. The subject of ufology is so out there that we have to, many of us have to just know that because of who you are, what we're doing is what we should be doing.
→ {"text": "不明飛行物學這個主題是如此超前，以至於我們許多人必須知道，正因為你們是誰，我們正在做的事情就是我們應該做的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. So speaking of what we should be doing, my question to each of you to answer in the time we have is where do you believe that the United States ranks in preparation to meet the global needs for the future?
→ {"text": "那麼說到我們應該做的事情，我想請你們每個人在有限的時間內回答：你們認為美國在準備滿足未來全球需求方面處於什麼地位？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. And where will the brilliant students that will become adults like yourselves, only some of them have to be women, come from to meet the numbers we're going to need?
→ {"text": "而那些將成為像你們這樣的成年人的優秀學生，其中一些必須是女性，他們將從何而來以滿足我們所需的人數？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. Well, when you asked the question, my immediate reaction was when you said the United States, I asked myself who's really in charge of the answer to your question?
→ {"text": "嗯，當你問這個問題時，我的第一反應是，當你說到美國時，我問自己，誰真正負責回答你的問題？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. And so I think the issue which we're dealing with is a truth embargo issue and this enormous secrecy which controls and dominates our entire process, maybe even including the educational process, but if you talk about我們大多數人認為我們生活的普通世界，顯然我們需要確立這樣的觀念：新的想法，正如斯坦·弗里德曼所說，發現來自於以不可預測的方式做不同的事情。
→ {"text": "所以我認為我們正在處理的問題是一個真相禁運問題，這種巨大的保密控制並主導著我們的整個過程，甚至可能包括教育過程，但如果你談論我們大多數人認為我們生活的普通世界，顯然我們需要確立這樣的觀念：新的想法，正如斯坦·弗里德曼所說，發現來自於以不可預測的方式做不同的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. So I think we need to emphasize the importance of creativity in developing the next set of equations that we need and may have already been discovered, but we need to make our society更好更強大。
→ {"text": "所以我認為我們需要強調創造力在發展我們需要且可能已經被發現的下一組方程式方面的重要性，但我們需要讓我們的社會變得更好更強大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. Well, I think we already have everything we need to create a sustainable, poverty-free world.
→ {"text": "嗯，我認為我們已經擁有創造一個可持續、無貧困世界所需的一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. It's already extant and this is very good news.
→ {"text": "它已經存在，這是非常好的消息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. The very bad news is that there is a ruthless, deep national security state that the people I have worked with have run into that is this massive buzzsaw.
→ {"text": "非常糟糕的消息是，存在一個無情的深層國家安全體系，與我共事的人們遭遇到了這個巨大的障礙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. And I think that at a certain point, we the people and the Congress and the United Nations and other countries have to come together and say, we've had enough of this nonsense.
→ {"text": "我認為在某個時刻，我們人民、國會、聯合國和其他國家必須團結起來說，我們受夠了這種胡說八道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. And I do not think this is going to come from an executive order from the President.
→ {"text": "而且我不認為這會來自總統的行政命令。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. I think it's going to come from people stepping forward and I wish to emphasize that as I did the other day, that in 1998 we declared these unacknowledged special access projects unconstitutional, a priori illegal.
→ {"text": "我認為這將來自人們挺身而出，我想強調的是，正如我前幾天所做的，1998年我們宣布這些未公開的特別許可項目（unacknowledged special access projects）違憲，先驗地非法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. And we encouraged and we now have over 500 people who have come forward to give us information documents and what have you on this.
→ {"text": "我們鼓勵並且現在有超過500人挺身而出，向我們提供信息文件等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. And I think we need to continue to do that.
→ {"text": "我認為我們需要繼續這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. I think we have to say to people who are really not responsive to the people that this is still a world of liberty and we have to be free to know the truth.
→ {"text": "我認為我們必須對那些真正不對人民負責的人說，這仍然是一個自由的世界，我們必須自由地知道真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. Very good.
→ {"text": "非常好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. Dr. Vallone.
→ {"text": "瓦隆博士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. Could I show slide 23, please, as I'm talking?
→ {"text": "我可以在說話的同時展示第23張幻燈片嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. What I'd like to explain is that I agree with our co-panelists and that is the United States already has this technology and I had the privilege of talking with a former black project engineer, spent the whole afternoon with him taking pages and pages of notes, one of which is actually in front of me right here.
→ {"text": "我想解釋的是，我同意我們的小組成員的觀點，那就是美國已經擁有這項技術，我有幸與一位前黑項目（black project）工程師交談，與他共度了整個下午，記了滿滿幾頁筆記，其中一頁就在我面前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. And what I learned is, first of all, he taught me all the details of creating an electro-gravitic layered semiconductor that with bismuth in between and magnesium and zinc, with the same percentages that when slide 23 pops up, you'll see that was published years before in a colleague's book called Secrets of Anti-Gravity Propulsion.
→ {"text": "我學到的是，首先，他教會了我創造電重力分層半導體的所有細節，其中間有鉍、鎂和鋅，比例相同，當第23張幻燈片出現時，你會看到這在多年前就已發表在一位同事的著作《反重力推進的秘密》（Secrets of Anti-Gravity Propulsion）中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. And Dr. Paul Violette only let me know a year later, he said, "Oh, this sounds like what I learned from another black project engineer who actually was through Aviation Weekly over in England."
→ {"text": "而保羅·維奧萊特博士（Dr. Paul Violette）一年後才告訴我，他說：「哦，這聽起來像我從另一位黑項目工程師那裡學到的，他實際上是通過英國的《航空週刊》（Aviation Weekly）知道的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. So this is very interesting because my contact told me so many things I couldn't believe, I just took the notes down.
→ {"text": "所以這非常有趣，因為我的聯繫人告訴了我這麼多我無法相信的事情，我只是把筆記記下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. But after I corroborated this with Linda Moulton-Hull's artifact as well, we have three different corroborations within 1% variation of the same artifact.
→ {"text": "但在我用琳達·莫爾頓-赫爾（Linda Moulton-Hull）的人工製品也證實了這一點之後，我們對同一人工製品有三個不同的證實，變化在1%以內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. In fact, slide 24, if she gets that up, will also show the actual semiconductor.
→ {"text": "事實上，如果她能把第24張幻燈片放出來，也會展示實際的半導體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. But the important part is that we have the technology, students are contacting our Integrity Research Institute all the time saying, "What should we study?"
→ {"text": "但重要的是我們擁有這項技術，學生們一直在聯繫我們的誠信研究所（Integrity Research Institute）問：「我們應該學習什麼？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. And this is, I used to be a college teacher, you need the 13 chapters with questions and answers at the end of each chapter.
→ {"text": "這就是，我曾經是大學老師，你需要13個章節，每章末尾都有問題和答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. And the books need to be written, the Zero Point Energy book, the Electro-Vitics book.
→ {"text": "而且需要編寫書籍，零點能源（Zero Point Energy）的書，電重力學（Electro-Vitics）的書。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. These textbooks are the textbooks of the future and the students are already there waiting to study this stuff.
→ {"text": "這些教科書是未來的教科書，學生們已經在等待學習這些內容了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. So this is the book I'm talking about and if we progress to the next slide, we'll see the actual page that Paul was talking about.
→ {"text": "這就是我說的書，如果我們進入下一張幻燈片，我們會看到保羅所說的實際頁面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. And this to me was amazing synchronicity.
→ {"text": "對我來說，這是驚人的同步性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. So I started to believe the other stuff that this black project fellow told me, and that is we already have a base on Mars, which was established in the 1970s, and I said, "Oh, I don't believe that."
→ {"text": "所以我開始相信這個黑項目傢伙告訴我的其他事情，那就是我們在火星上已經有一個基地，建立於1970年代，我說：「哦，我不相信。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. He says, "Oh, go check the NASA records of the greenhouse gases from Mars' atmosphere.
→ {"text": "他說：「哦，去查一下NASA關於火星大氣層溫室氣體的記錄。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

474. They increased in the 1970s."
→ {"text": "它們在1970年代增加了。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. And that was his counterpoint and so forth, he says, "We have a deep space platform."
→ {"text": "這就是他的反駁等等，他說：「我們有一個深空平台。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. He even gave me a jaw dropper and that was the Gulf Breeze UFO conferences that almost amazingly always had a UFO sighting during the conference.
→ {"text": "他甚至給了我一個令人震驚的消息，那就是海灣微風不明飛行物會議（Gulf Breeze UFO conferences），幾乎總是驚人地在會議期間出現不明飛行物目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

477. He says, "I know the guy who ran that craft, it was a back to engineered craft and he just did it for fun, fly over the UFO conference and create some stir."
→ {"text": "他說：「我認識駕駛那艘飛行器的人，那是一艘反向工程的飛行器，他那樣做只是為了好玩，飛過不明飛行物會議上空製造一些轟動。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

478. So this is the kind of problem we have.
→ {"text": "所以我們面臨的就是這種問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

479. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

We don't know whether this is a multiverse, whether there are various time areas involved, but someone does know and I believe that at one time at the days of Majestic 12 and Eisenhower and Truman and so on and the state that the world was in, it was necessary to keep this a secret from the public.
