## Speaker Group 1

774. Now we'll -- and now we'll go to closing statements from -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

775. I want to say thank you for the invitation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

776. I'm certainly a much wiser, better public servant than I was before I walked through these doors.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

777. To my panel, my colleagues, you've been excellent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

778. Many times we are so busy in Congress, we don't get to know each other unless we travel in what's called congressional delegations and do some work, or work on the committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

779. You know best your committee and your caucus.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

780. And beyond that, these things help.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

781. So thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

782. And to the staff and all of you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

783. To the witnesses who have been with us all week, outstanding.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

784. I think it's America's loss that none of the press across this country felt the obligation to cover these hearings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

785. The information that we've learned, that American people should also have learned, and those who streamed God Bless Them probably did get some of it, will make them better people as we confront the next hundred years, the next thousand years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

786. Because I really believe, and I wasn't convinced before I came in, but we did a little two-minute interview on the close of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

787. And what I said in mine is, I didn't know before and I still have a lot to learn.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

788. But I'm willing to learn.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

789. Because it's a universal problem and I want my grandchildren and yours, and our great grandchildren to have a universal much to operate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

790. So on behalf of this Congresswoman, as I go about my day and catch my plane and hope it lands smoothly, doctors, that I can come back and be with you again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

791. We've got a lot of work to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

792. But I think you educate the people from the bottom up and not from top down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

793. It doesn't work like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

794. We've done it in revolutions all over this world for hundreds of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

795. This is a revolutionary issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

796. And if we're going to sustain ourselves as humans, just a part of the universe, we've got work to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

797. To all of you, and I'm looking and seeing some of you in the audience as you presented to us, thank you for allowing me to be with you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

798. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

799. [ Applause ]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 2

800. Yes, thank you, Congresswoman Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

801. Dr. Bookman, you've got just a minute of announcements before the break.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

802. Well, first of all, I'd like to say to the honorable representative from Michigan, you ma'am are a hero.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

803. You're a hero, just as much as any of these witnesses, when we reached out to former members of Congress, the answer for many was, well, who else is going to be on that committee with me?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

804. I'll serve, but I won't serve with so-and-so, or I want to know who else is there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

805. You agreed to do this not knowing any of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

806. You stood up and said, "Yes, I'll do it," and opened the space for everyone else to be here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

807. Before you leave, I wanted to share that with you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

808. So, you ma'am are our John Glenn, first one up to orbit the earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

809. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
