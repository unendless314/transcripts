150. Dr. Vallone, ten minutes.
→ {"text": "瓦隆博士，您有十分鐘時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "聽證會主持人宣布證詞時間"}

151. I'd like to start with my slides and show them exclusively as I go through them.
→ {"text": "我想從我的投影片開始，並在報告過程中逐一展示。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. What I'm about to say is my own personal viewpoint does not relate in any way to the federal government.
→ {"text": "我即將陳述的內容純屬個人觀點，與聯邦政府無任何關聯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. Nothing I'm stating is reflecting government policy and they're my original thoughts as a private citizen.
→ {"text": "我所陳述的內容不代表政府政策，而是我作為普通公民的個人見解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. This is a presentation of what I'm familiar with and my journey began in 1980 with the book called Sunburst Return of the Agents by Norman Paulson.
→ {"text": "這是我所熟悉領域的報告，我的研究旅程始於1980年，當時讀了 Norman Paulson 所著的《Sunburst Return of the Agents》一書。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "書名保留原文"}

156. The book was fascinating in the fact that there were a lot of very anomalous UFO details shown.
→ {"text": "這本書非常引人入勝，因為書中展示了許多極為異常的不明飛行物細節。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. This particular side-by-side photo and the person who took the photo was a deputy sheriff holding the instamatic photo taken in broad daylight over Giant Rock.
→ {"text": "這張並排照片是由一位副警長拍攝的，他用即拍即有相機在光天化日之下於巨石（Giant Rock）上空拍攝了這張照片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Giant Rock 譯為巨石"}

158. This is fascinating because none of this has happened since then and Van Tassel, George Van Tassel was responsible for holding UFO conferences through the 50s and through the 60s.
→ {"text": "這非常令人著迷，因為自那以後再也沒有發生過類似事件，而喬治·凡·塔瑟爾（George Van Tassel）在1950年代和1960年代負責舉辦不明飛行物會議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. I even talked to Dr. Bob Beck who witnessed one of these craft and as you can see there's some type of force illumination below the craft as well.
→ {"text": "我甚至與 Bob Beck 博士談過，他親眼目睹了其中一艘飛行器，正如你們所見，飛行器下方還有某種力場照明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. So I went out to the community and found what they were working on was a homopolar generator.
→ {"text": "於是我前往該社區，發現他們正在研究的是同極發電機（homopolar generator）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. The interesting part of the book described the propulsion system as being 12 magnets around the outer edge of all the very large disk size of the ship carrying off electrical current.
→ {"text": "書中有趣的部分描述了推進系統：在飛船巨大碟形結構的外緣周圍有12個磁鐵，負責傳導電流。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. Two disks in opposite direction provided the gravity force, whatever propulsion system they had.
→ {"text": "兩個反向旋轉的碟片提供了重力力量，無論他們使用的是什麼推進系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. So this particular passage I reprinted in my homopolar handbook.
→ {"text": "因此我將這段特別的內容重印在我的同極發電機手冊中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. And also convinced my professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo to let me work on it as a physics project for my master's degree in physics.
→ {"text": "我還說服了紐約州立大學水牛城分校的教授，讓我將這個題目作為物理學碩士學位的研究項目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. And I was very pleased to actually build a homopolar generator, test it for back torque and unfortunately I measured back torque, which means it slows down as you draw current from it.
→ {"text": "我非常榮幸能夠實際建造一台同極發電機，並測試其反扭矩。不幸的是，我測量到了反扭矩，這意味著當你從中提取電流時，它會減速。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. So the mystery continued.
→ {"text": "因此這個謎團持續存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. I basically found that Dr. Ed Mitchell as you see here on the cover of Extraordinary Science magazine was also interested in the same topic.
→ {"text": "我基本上發現，正如你們在《Extraordinary Science》雜誌封面上所見的 Ed Mitchell 博士，也對同一主題感興趣。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "雜誌名保留原文"}

171. Bruce De Palma was the source of the interest and he was building homopolar generators like crazy, looking for investors one after another, which he succeeded in doing.
→ {"text": "布魯斯·德帕爾瑪（Bruce De Palma）是這個興趣的來源，他瘋狂地建造同極發電機，一個接一個地尋找投資者，並且他成功了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. However, Ed held on to his money, which is in his breast pocket there, and what was interesting about this particular cover that came out years later was that the serial disk is also shown on the same magazine cover next to the homopolar.
→ {"text": "然而，Ed 緊握著他的錢，就在他的胸袋裡。這張多年後出版的封面有趣之處在於，瑟爾碟（Searle disk）也與同極發電機一同出現在雜誌封面上。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "serial disk 應為 Searle disk（瑟爾碟）的誤聽"}

173. So I thought this was sort of a coincidence or synchronicity and I ended up investigating the serial disk.
→ {"text": "所以我認為這是一種巧合或同步性，於是我開始研究瑟爾碟（Searle disk）。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "serial disk 應為 Searle disk 的誤聽"}

174. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. And I met John Searle in 1980 in Germany and he actually became kind of a curiosity to me.
→ {"text": "我在1980年於德國見到了約翰·瑟爾（John Searle），他對我來說確實成了一個好奇的對象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. Even today he still is.
→ {"text": "即使到今天他仍然如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. He's still a living legend.
→ {"text": "他仍然是一位活著的傳奇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

178. He claimed to have these disks, as you can see here, hovering and he had a UFO experience when he was young and then he started building these things.
→ {"text": "他聲稱擁有這些碟片，正如你們在這裡所見，能夠懸浮。他年輕時曾有過不明飛行物經歷，然後開始建造這些裝置。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. So next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. Basically tried to help him, connected with different people.
→ {"text": "我基本上試圖幫助他，與不同的人建立聯繫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

181. He essentially became a little more well known when he gave a talk in Berlin in 1990.
→ {"text": "當他在1990年於柏林發表演講時，他基本上變得更為人知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. And then some Russians discovered him because of that lecture and the video and decided to build what they described as a single roller magnet assembly with 12 roller magnets around the outer edge of a ring.
→ {"text": "然後一些俄羅斯人因為那次演講和影片發現了他，並決定建造他們所描述的單滾輪磁鐵組件：在環形結構外緣周圍有12個滾輪磁鐵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. And so I started to think twice of, hey, this may be something related to what was called the Moo disk back in the Paulson book.
→ {"text": "於是我開始重新思考：嘿，這可能與 Paulson 書中所說的 Moo 碟有關。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Moo disk 保留原文"}

184. And that's one of the biographies you can get off the shelf, "Anti-Gravity, the Dream Made Reality" by John Thomas.
→ {"text": "這是你可以從書架上找到的傳記之一：John Thomas 所著的《Anti-Gravity, the Dream Made Reality》。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "書名保留原文"}

185. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. So long story short is that these roller magnets are individual homopolar generators and these definitely seem to lend itself to voltage generation if the whole ring could somehow be propelled.
→ {"text": "簡而言之，這些滾輪磁鐵是獨立的同極發電機，如果整個環形結構能以某種方式被推動，它們似乎確實能夠產生電壓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. And that's the magic and the mystery behind the whole thing.
→ {"text": "這就是整件事情的魔法與奧秘所在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

188. Well, the Russians had a whole grocery list, as you can see on the right, of all these anomalies that they supposedly measured.
→ {"text": "俄羅斯人有一份完整的清單，正如你們在右邊所見，列出了他們聲稱測量到的所有異常現象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. And so what I ended up doing, next slide, was to connect them to an investor, which I constantly do throughout these years, find an investor for the strange inventors, put them together.
→ {"text": "於是我接下來所做的，下一張投影片，就是為他們尋找投資者。這些年來我不斷這樣做：為這些奇特的發明家尋找投資者，將他們撮合在一起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. In this case, we went to the Department of Energy.
→ {"text": "在這個案例中，我們前往了能源部。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. The contact was very friendly to us, offered a Russian translator for us.
→ {"text": "聯繫人對我們非常友善，為我們提供了一位俄語翻譯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. We did due diligence for the whole day.
→ {"text": "我們進行了整天的盡職調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. And the investor was comfortable to throw his money at the Russian Godin and Roschin inventions.
→ {"text": "投資者願意將資金投入俄羅斯的 Godin 和 Roschin 發明。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "根據 topics.json 的修正建議，gold and roast 應為 Godin and Roschin"}

194. And the outcome was, next slide, the big prototype at cost of a lot of money, which was built and completed in Moscow.
→ {"text": "結果是，下一張投影片，這個耗資巨大的大型原型機在莫斯科建造並完成。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. And then it was retrofitted and completed again and again.
→ {"text": "然後它被反覆改裝和完成。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

196. And even to this day, it doesn't quite do what it's supposed to do, but it certainly looks interesting.
→ {"text": "即使到今天，它並沒有完全達到預期的功能，但看起來確實很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. So back to the George Van Tassel story.
→ {"text": "回到喬治·凡·塔瑟爾（George Van Tassel）的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. Since this is dealing with implications of extraterrestrial technology, George's story is that he had lots of UFO experiences, even rides on craft and so forth.
→ {"text": "由於這涉及外星科技的含義，喬治的故事是他有過許多不明飛行物經歷，甚至乘坐過飛行器等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. And his, what do you say, his download or his conclusion from all of these experiences was, hey, I'm going to build a healing chamber, a rejuvenation chamber called the Integratron.
→ {"text": "而他從所有這些經歷中獲得的資訊或結論是：嘿，我要建造一個治療艙，一個稱為積分器（Integratron）的再生艙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. And it's right near Giant Rock, I've actually gone out there.
→ {"text": "它就位於巨石（Giant Rock）附近，我實際上去過那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. And it still is in existence today, integratron.com.
→ {"text": "它至今仍然存在，網址是 integratron.com。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "網址保留原文"}

204. And it's all wood construction with no nails.
→ {"text": "它完全由木材建造，沒有使用任何釘子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. And it's very fascinating because it has these unusual die rods.
→ {"text": "這非常引人入勝，因為它擁有這些不尋常的介電棒（die rods）。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "die rods 技術術語，指介電材料棒"}

207. The whole assembly of die rods was supposed to rotate.
→ {"text": "整組介電棒應該能夠旋轉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. And it also has a primary and secondary coil inside that looks like an inverted Tesla coil.
→ {"text": "它內部還有初級和次級線圈，看起來像是一個倒置的特斯拉線圈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. So you get the impression that it would draw atmospheric electricity, since it's very dry there, it's feasible, this would work.
→ {"text": "所以你會有這樣的印象：它能夠吸收大氣中的電能，由於那裡非常乾燥，這是可行的，這套系統能夠運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. And then charge up the inside with some of this energy.
→ {"text": "然後用這種能量為內部充電。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. So that concludes the possible rejuvenation implications of ET contact.
→ {"text": "以上總結了外星接觸可能帶來的再生效益。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "ET = Extraterrestrial，譯為外星"}

213. And what I'd like to conclude with is the zero-point energy inertial shielding on electro-gravity.
→ {"text": "而我想要總結的是關於電重力（electro-gravity）的零點能源（zero-point energy）與慣性屏蔽（inertial shielding）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "專業術語保留英文並加註中文"}

217. I wrote two books, actually.
→ {"text": "實際上我寫了兩本書。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. And it's been confirmed consistently, even up to last week, where our future energy news announced some new polymer pyrrole that actually can't be explained unless two-thirds of it is due to zero-point energy.
→ {"text": "這一直得到持續證實，甚至直到上週，我們的未來能源新聞報導了一種新的聚吡咯（polymer pyrrole），除非其中三分之二歸因於零點能源，否則無法解釋其特性。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "pyrrole 為化學術語，指吡咯"}

219. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. And here we have the reason why zero-point energy may be important.
→ {"text": "在這裡我們可以看到零點能源為何可能很重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. And we'll see if she can insert the 30-second video that's supposed to actually start.

225. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. This is an example of many, you've probably seen some of these already, that the craft is spinning, it's up close, it looks like a legitimate, authentic video, amateur video.
→ {"text": "這是眾多例子之一，你們可能已經看過其中一些，飛行器正在旋轉，距離很近，看起來像是一段真實、可信的業餘影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. And right about now you're going to see a very fast acceleration.
→ {"text": "就在此時，你們將看到一段非常快速的加速。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. And that's what we've been talking about, folks.
→ {"text": "各位，這就是我們一直在談論的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. And the important part is that this introduces a concept, which I'd like to share with the panel, and that is inertia is involved.
→ {"text": "重要的是，這引入了一個概念，我想與委員會分享，那就是慣性（inertia）的參與。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. And as we get to the next slide, hopefully we can see that, the inertial mass and gravitational mass are totally different.
→ {"text": "當我們進入下一張投影片時，希望我們能看到這一點：慣性質量（inertial mass）與重力質量（gravitational mass）是完全不同的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "物理學專業術語保留英文"}

232. I repeat myself.
→ {"text": "我重複一遍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. Inertial mass and gravitational mass have nothing to do with each other.
→ {"text": "慣性質量與重力質量彼此毫無關聯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. Einstein made a mistake years ago and called it the equivalence principle.

235. I studied it even in grad school.
→ {"text": "我甚至在研究所就學時研究過這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. I took relativity and I took general relativity.
→ {"text": "我修過相對論和廣義相對論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. And so it's fascinating to me that it's sort of overlooked.
→ {"text": "所以令我著迷的是，這一點某種程度上被忽略了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. Slide right after this.
→ {"text": "這張投影片之後的下一張。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. And the important part is that nowadays, inertia has been discovered to be a zero-point field, Lorentz force, by Hayes, Schwetter, and Puthoff.
→ {"text": "重要的是，如今海施、魯埃達與普特夫（Haisch, Rueda, and Puthoff）已經發現，慣性是一種零點場、勞倫茲力（Lorentz force）。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "根據 topics.json 修正建議，Hayes, Schwetter 應為 Haisch, Rueda"}

240. This is a seminal paper that's so important that it opens the door to actually controlling inertia and understanding how any ET craft or UFOs could possibly have fast acceleration right angle turns and maybe even travel through the universe.
→ {"text": "這是一篇極具開創性的論文，如此重要，它開啟了實際控制慣性的大門，並讓我們理解任何外星飛行器或不明飛行物如何能夠實現快速加速、直角轉彎，甚至可能穿越宇宙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. It turns out F equals V cross B, a simple Lorentz force at the bottom of the slide there showing how it works.
→ {"text": "結果證明 F 等於 V 叉乘 B，投影片底部展示了一個簡單的勞倫茲力（Lorentz force）公式，說明其運作原理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "物理公式保留原文"}

242. So when we go around a curve and you feel that force moving you in the opposite direction, it's an electromagnetic interaction.
→ {"text": "所以當我們繞過彎道時，你感覺到那股將你推向反方向的力量，這是一種電磁交互作用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. And this applies to relativity.
→ {"text": "這適用於相對論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. I heard one of the gentlemen on the panel questioning special relativity.
→ {"text": "我聽到委員會上的一位先生在質疑狹義相對論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. Well, that's inertial mass.
→ {"text": "嗯，那就是慣性質量（inertial mass）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. That is the M in relativistic increase in mass as you go toward the speed of light.
→ {"text": "那就是當你接近光速時，相對論性質量增加的 M（質量）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. If you can shield inertial mass, miracles happen.

249. And this is another demonstration.
→ {"text": "這是另一個演示。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. I showed this slide to the deputy director of the NRO, National Reconnaissance Office, in case you don't know what NRO stands for.
→ {"text": "我將這張投影片展示給國家偵察局（NRO, National Reconnaissance Office）的副局長，以防你們不知道 NRO 代表什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. And this was very important because, as you see, F equals MA, Newton's law, can be modified.
→ {"text": "這非常重要，因為正如你們所見，F 等於 MA，牛頓定律，是可以被修改的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "物理公式保留原文"}

252. If M can be shielded and it lowers, then A could increase for the same amount of force.
→ {"text": "如果 M（質量）可以被屏蔽並降低，那麼在相同力量下，A（加速度）就可以增加。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "物理公式保留原文"}

253. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. Oh, and by the way, the NRO deputy director said, well, things like this tend to become more and more classified until they're out of sight.
→ {"text": "喔，順便一提，國家偵察局副局長說，這類事情往往會變得越來越機密，直到完全消失不見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. He says it's easier for us to reinvent it for a private contractor.
→ {"text": "他說，對我們來說，為私人承包商重新發明它更容易。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. And I said, you mean the taxpayers have to pay double for something like this?
→ {"text": "我說，你的意思是納稅人必須為這種東西支付雙倍費用？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. And he said, yes.
→ {"text": "他說，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. Here's another proof of inertial shielding, and that is the right angle turn that's photographed here with open shutter, 35 millimeter on tripod, 2 a.m. outside Stewart Air Force Base.
→ {"text": "這裡有另一個慣性屏蔽（inertial shielding）的證據，那就是在這裡拍攝到的直角轉彎：使用開啟快門的35毫米相機架在三腳架上，凌晨2點在斯圖爾特空軍基地（Stewart Air Force Base）外拍攝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. The triangle craft started from the upper part and the shutter was open, made a tremendous right turn, and then continued as if nothing happened.
→ {"text": "這架三角形飛行器從上方開始，快門開啟著，它做了一個巨大的右轉，然後繼續前進，彷彿什麼事都沒發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. Red and green lights make it look like it's conventional.
→ {"text": "紅色和綠色燈光讓它看起來像是傳統飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. And Dr. Villon, you've got about one minute.
→ {"text": "瓦隆博士，您還有大約一分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Villon 是 Vallone 的誤聽"}

263. I understand.
→ {"text": "我明白。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. I see.
→ {"text": "我知道了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. So the conclusion is an electrokinetic equation helps explain how we can combine electrokinetics or electrogravity and inertial shielding.
→ {"text": "所以結論是，電動力學方程（electrokinetic equation）有助於解釋我們如何結合電動力學（electrokinetics）或電重力（electrogravity）與慣性屏蔽（inertial shielding）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "專業術語保留英文並加註中文"}

266. Pulsed current will produce a force.
→ {"text": "脈衝電流將產生力量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. And I wrote a book on the electrogravity effect that's even present in the B2 bomber thanks to Paul LaViolette's work and research and originally starting with Townsend Brown's research.
→ {"text": "我寫了一本關於電重力效應（electrogravity effect）的書，這種效應甚至存在於 B-2 轟炸機（B2 bomber）中，這要歸功於保羅·拉維奧萊特（Paul LaViolette）的研究工作，最初則始於湯森·布朗（Townsend Brown）的研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. Next slide.
→ {"text": "下一張投影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. And the conclusion is, and I have to give thanks to Mark McCandlish, who gave a testimony of Dr. Greer's 2001 disclosure project in D.C. since we know once in a while such an electrokinetic-powered craft are put on display, as this one was in 1908 in Norton Air Force Base, which is also his entire testimony is reproduced thanks to Mark in my book Electrogravitics 2.
→ {"text": "結論是，我必須感謝馬克·麥坎德利什（Mark McCandlish），他在格里爾博士（Dr. Greer）2001年於華盛頓特區舉行的揭露計畫（Disclosure Project）中提供了證詞。因為我們知道，偶爾會有這種以電動力（electrokinetic）驅動的飛行器被展示出來，就像1908年在諾頓空軍基地（Norton Air Force Base）展示的那架一樣。馬克將他的完整證詞收錄在我的《電重力學2》（Electrogravitics 2）一書中。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "根據 topics.json 修正建議，1908應為1988或1998，但保留原文；Electrogravitics 2為書名保留原文"}

271. And this is also verified and investigated by Dr. Hal Putoff, and I talked to him personally about this story of Norton Air Force Base showing three hovercraft, and he did his due diligence with it, and he says he put it in his gray box of possible events.
→ {"text": "這也經過哈爾·普特夫博士（Dr. Hal Putoff）的驗證和調查，我親自與他談過諾頓空軍基地展示三架氣墊船的故事，他進行了盡職調查，他說他將這件事放入了他的「可能事件灰盒子」中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. Thank you.
