## Speaker Group 1

274. [ Applause ] We'll now be going to Roger Leir, if you wouldn't mind before we begin, could you tell us what DDPM stands for?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. Major Podiatric Medicine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. I want to thank the chair of the committee, Mr. Cook, honorable members of the committee, congressional members, my fellow colleagues that are here, and guests for allowing me to present this material to you today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. I know we have certain time constraints, so we will do my very best to stay within those time constraints.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. I've already submitted a written document which I will read to the committee, and I've also submitted to you some paperwork which is of a scientific nature of our findings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. But I have not stated anything of my own personal background, so I'd like to take a very short period of time to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. I have a degree as a bachelor of science, a doctor of podiatric medicine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. I did research with Dow Corning for bone replacement implants, I've done participated in research in tendon regeneration, I have a good knowledge of the biological workings of the human body.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. I was also, for three years, the chairman of a committee at the Cedars Lebanon Hospital in Hollywood, California, head of the diabetic clinic and director of residency training program at a hospital in Simi Valley, California.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. If anyone had told me at that time that I would be involved in anything in the UFO field or traveled to 42 countries and participated in the things that I have participated in relative to UFOs, I would have said, "They're nuts."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. Strange things have happened in my life that were very synchronistic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. One of these was my cousin's occupation as a Ph.D. psychology professor at the University of Connecticut who wrote a series of books on the near-death experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. One of the books he wrote was called The Omega Project and it was funded by the University of Connecticut, but the interesting thing was that the story that he was trying to portray or the research project itself was to look for a common psychological profile between those who had UFO experiences and those that had near-death experiences.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. The end result was there wasn't any, it was a totally entirely different subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. At that time, I was just getting into the field and he asked me if I would like to have his research material because he no longer was going to be doing anything with UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. I accepted and expected to get a little package.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. I got boxes and boxes and boxes of material, research work and books from some of the best known authors in the field of ufology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. Now, it's a two-way street.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. I came here not only to present information but also to learn information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. For example, I was very interested to learn that the Eisenhower speech not only talked about the military-industrial complex, but the military-industrial-congressional complex.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. I thought that was very informative.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. I also thought that it was very informative to learn that the oaths that were taken by military officers and other officers in government was to the Constitution of the United States and not to any particular committee or policy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. I am here also as a student to learn from you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. What I've planned today and ask you that favor again with time constraints is that at the end of my presentation, I'm allowed to ask you just two questions which may be answered by any one of you that would like to take the challenge of answering it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. We'll be willing to suspend to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. I appreciate that, Mr. Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. Now I'd like to read the written presentation that I've prepared and submitted to the committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. I with my surgical team of medical specialists performed 16 surgeries for the removal of foreign objects from those individuals who allege alien abduction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. The 16 cases involved the removal of 17 separate and distinct objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. One of these objects turned out to be a small run of ceramic-like glass which was manufactured by Dow Corning Industries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. In almost my 50 years of podiatric surgical practice, I have removed literally hundreds or numerous objects from the human foot including paper, glass, metal, stones, hair, coral, many other objects including secret metal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. At one time, a patient came in with two gentlemen in suits and the proper identification.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. He worked as a machinist for an aerospace company.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. I removed the object and they said, "Please."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. And so I handed them the material that I removed from the individual's foot, later come to find out that it was a new material that was experimental for the use of rocket valves and rocketry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. The individuals involved in this study all presented with no noted portal of entry for any of the objects that were removed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. There was no visible scar formation and there was no interruption of the integrity of the skin even when examination was performed with a magnifying loop, not only examining the area involved but a large amount of the peripheral area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. All the individuals in the study presented with positive x-rays or CT scans showing metallic or lesser dense foreign objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. Prior to the surgical procedures performed, the areas of interest were examined by the use of a gauss meter for magnetic or electromagnetic emissions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. Ten of them were found to be producing readings on a gauss meter of 6 to 10 milligauss.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. That is a large amount for a very small object that varies in size from approximately 6 to 10 millimetres in length and about the diameter of a pencil head.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. Now I understand that from the crew here and some of the television people I've worked with that a modern television camera produces about 4.3 milligauss of emissions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. So here's a very small object producing 10 milligauss of emissions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. Now in addition to these type of examinations we used frequencies of ultraviolet light to detect fluorescence in the area of the object.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. About 60% presented with positive UV light fluorescence with colour ranges from pink, green to yellow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. One of the last surgical patients displayed a large chevron appearing area like an insignia on the outside of the right arm near the shoulder.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. He had no prior knowledge of it being there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. We have also found that the removal of this fluorescent material with ordinary solvents only makes them disappear for intervals of approximately one hour.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. And when re-examined again they appear again with the use of ultraviolet light with varying frequencies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. In addition by use of radio wave frequency detector we were able to detect that certain radio frequencies in the FM band both in the megahertz and kilohertz range were being admitted from the object.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. It was determined that in one case the frequencies detected and this is through a chart that I was able to obtain through sources that I will not be able to mention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. But these frequencies were noted fixed or mobile deep space frequencies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. Unfortunately our limited budget for performing this research has not allowed us to obtain a radio frequency analyser so that a radio wave could be captured and analysed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. All the surgeries we performed were documented with eye witnesses, video and still photography.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. We established a chain of criteria and protocols for a forensic chain of custody.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. All the objects were placed in sterile containers using the patient's own blood serum.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. These containers are then signed and not opened again until they reach the laboratories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. I will skip some of the material because of time constraints.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. We find that in all pathological reports there is no inflammatory reaction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. There is no rejection reaction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. There is no inexhaustive research of human science.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. There is nothing that we have found in material science that will produce absolutely no inflammatory reaction in the human body.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. These objects all do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. Also in addition they are surrounded by a large amount of specialised nerve endings called proprioceptors and these are areas which are not consistent with Grey's anatomy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. The pathology reports and examination we have sent to material science laboratories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. Some of these include Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico Tech, University of California at San Diego, Southwest Laboratories in San Antonio, Texas as well as numerous other laboratories outside the country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. ANS research scientists and our science board has enabled us to do some of our own scientific studies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. I've already described some of the length and size of the object so we'll skip over that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. Doctor, I absolutely hate to do this but your time has expired and what we are going to do though is suspend and allow you your request and I would ask the members of the panel to keep their answers, not questions, their answers here as short as possible so that we can at least get five minutes for our questioning of this technology panel that I am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. How often do you get to hear from four PhD physicists, scientists, everything else?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. So I want to have plenty of time for our questions but go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. You want me to finish?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. No, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. I want you to ask the question if you ask me to change the rules in order to ask.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. What I'd like to ask you number one is do you in your present positions being retired congress people, senator, do you consider the United States to be a world superpower?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. Anybody that wishes to answer that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. In terms of military capability and force, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. In terms of intellectual capacity and moral guidance, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. Congressman Kirkpatrick, would you like to add anything?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. Now this will be very short, let's assume that what we learned from them up there, let's just assume hypothetically that this is a reality.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. What kind of a position would you think that the United States would be on a world scale if a third world country, a renegade country, would release the entire amount of information to the public of the world?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. It couldn't do anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. In fact, that's one of the things we hope that if the issue is brought before the General Assembly and it's voted to hold a global conference, then that conference will be its own guide, regardless of the United States of America or Britain or any other country, because it will be beyond their control, and that's one of the reasons why I personally would like this issue to go before the General Assembly and not go before the Congress, which I think would just continue the cover up that we've experienced from the government for the last 50 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
