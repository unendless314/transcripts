→ {"text": "我已經提交了一份書面文件，我將向委員會朗讀，同時我也向各位提交了一些關於我們研究發現的科學性質文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. But I have not stated anything of my own personal background, so I'd like to take a very short period of time to do that.
→ {"text": "但我還沒有說明我的個人背景，所以我想用很短的時間來介紹一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. I have a degree as a bachelor of science, a doctor of podiatric medicine.
→ {"text": "我擁有理學學士學位，以及足病醫學博士（Doctor of Podiatric Medicine）學位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. I did research with Dow Corning for bone replacement implants, I've done participated in research in tendon regeneration, I have a good knowledge of the biological workings of the human body.

→ {"text": "其中之一是我表親的職業，他是康乃狄克大學的心理學博士教授，撰寫了一系列關於瀕死體驗的書籍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. One of the books he wrote was called The Omega Project and it was funded by the University of Connecticut, but the interesting thing was that the story that he was trying to portray or the research project本身 was to look for a common psychological profile between those who had UFO experiences and those that had near-death experiences.
→ {"text": "他寫的其中一本書叫做《歐米茄計畫》（The Omega Project），由康乃狄克大學資助，但有趣的是，他試圖描繪的故事或者說研究計畫本身，是要尋找有不明飛行物體驗者和有瀕死體驗者之間共同的心理特徵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "The Omega Project = 歐米茄計畫"}

289. The end result was there wasn't any, it was a totally entirely different subject.
→ {"text": "最終結果是兩者之間並沒有共同點，這是完全不同的兩個主題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. That is a large amount for a very small object that varies in size from approximately 6 to 10 millimetres in length and about the diameter of a pencil head.
→ {"text": "對於一個非常小的物體來說，這是很大的數值——這些物體大小約從6到10毫米不等，直徑約相當於鉛筆頭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. Now I understand that from the crew here and some of the television people I've worked with that a modern television camera produces about 4.3 milligauss of emissions.

324. We have also found that the removal of this fluorescent material with ordinary solvents only makes them disappear for intervals of approximately one hour.
→ {"text": "我們還發現，使用普通溶劑去除這種螢光物質，只能讓它們消失約一小時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. And when re-examined again they appear again with the use of ultraviolet light with varying frequencies.
→ {"text": "當再次使用不同頻率的紫外線檢查時，它們又會重新出現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. In addition by use of radio wave frequency detector we were able to detect that certain radio frequencies in the FM band both in the megahertz and kilohertz range were being admitted from the object.
→ {"text": "此外，通過使用無線電波頻率探測器，我們能夠檢測到物體發出調頻（FM）波段中的某些無線電頻率，包括兆赫和千赫範圍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. It was determined that in one case the frequencies detected and this is through a chart that I was able to obtain through sources that I will not be able to mention.
→ {"text": "在一個案例中，通過我從無法透露的來源獲得的圖表，確定了所檢測到的頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. But these frequencies were noted fixed or mobile deep space frequencies.
→ {"text": "但這些頻率被記錄為固定或移動的深空通訊頻率。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. Unfortunately our limited budget for performing this research has not allowed us to obtain a radio frequency analyser so that a radio wave could be captured and analysed.
→ {"text": "不幸的是，我們進行這項研究的有限預算，使我們無法獲得無線電頻率分析儀來捕捉和分析無線電波。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. Doctor, I absolutely hate to do this but your time has expired and what we are going to do though is suspend and allow you your request and I would ask the members of the panel to keep their answers, not questions, their answers here as short as possible so that we can at least get five minutes for our questioning of this technology panel that I am.
→ {"text": "博士，我非常不想這樣做，但您的時間已經到了。不過我們會暫停規則，允許您提出請求。我也請求委員會成員們，你們的回答——不是問題，是你們的回答——請盡量簡短，這樣我們至少還能有五分鐘時間來詢問這個技術小組。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. In fact, that's one of the things we hope that if the issue is brought before the General Assembly and it's voted to hold a global conference, then that conference will be its own guide, regardless of the United States of America or Britain or any other country, because it will be beyond their control, and that's one of the reasons why I personally would like this issue to go before the General Assembly and not go before the Congress, which I think would just continue the cover up that we've experienced from the government for the last 50 years.
→ {"text": "事實上，這正是我們所希望的——如果這個議題被提交到聯合國大會（General Assembly），並且投票決定舉行一場全球會議，那麼這場會議將成為自己的指引，無論是美國、英國還是任何其他國家都無法控制，因為它將超越他們的控制範圍。這也是我個人希望這個議題提交到聯合國大會而不是國會的原因之一，我認為國會只會繼續過去50年來我們從政府那裡經歷過的真相掩蓋（cover up）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "General Assembly = 聯合國大會；cover up = 真相掩蓋"}
