    before the General Assembly and it's voted to hold a global conference, then that
    conference will be its own guide, regardless of the United States of America or
    Britain or any other country, because it will be beyond their control, and that's
    one of the reasons why I personally would like this issue to go before the General
    Assembly and not go before the Congress, which I think would just continue the
    cover up that we've experienced from the government for the last 50 years.
