it."},{"segment_id":24,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That was when I read my first UFO book, actually one by Don Menzel, the science arch skeptic, and I saw clearly that he was ignoring the

question?"},{"segment_id":33,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Therefore, we started a little project, kept quite low key, to study the question of how they work."},{"segment_id":34,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Everyone who worked on this project knew that when the project was over, each would go back to his other job or be laid off."},{"segment_id":35,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This was when we needed to find someone to study the sightings and reports in detail to see if we could get clues as to how they worked, and we hired Stan Friedman."},{"segment_id":36,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We should have a picture of Stan Friedman up there right now as he looked in 1968."},{"segment_id":37,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We did a lot of interesting projects such as measure the effects of a huge magnetic field on the speed of

know."},{"segment_id":74,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But beyond that, I could say I would look for the following, four things."},{"segment_id":75,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"First, a way to cross the light years to stars without actually physically speeding past and through the space and space debris that separates us."},{"segment_id":76,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Second, a way to interact with time in a reliable fashion through the equivalent of the so-called wormhole so that journeys would take years, wind up taking minutes."},{"segment_id":77,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Third, a way to permit a person's mind to interact with matter so reliably that all you have to do is think clearly and equipment does what you want it to if designed right."},{"segment_id":78,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Finally, to expect that the breakthroughs will come from unknown scientists, probably pretty young, who are looking outside the establishment's perspective of the solution."},{"segment_id":79,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I leave you with this thought, that Arthur Clarke's famous quote is highly applicable."},{"segment_id":80,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."},{"segment_id":81,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think that the millions of years that may separate us from the alien civilizations are not significant because logic does not change with time."},{"segment_id":82,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I expect that the laws of physics, which we have yet to understand, will be the same and so will the equations."},{"segment_id":83,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We just have to find

that were developed had a number of changes that resulted in what is now classic electromagnetic theory."},{"segment_id":91,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This has resulted in a number of errors in the equations, which have been corrected by people who have looked at them very carefully."},{"segment_id":92,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Between the late 1800s and 1929, there were a number of

Defense document demanding that the FBI turn these over to the DOD."},{"segment_id":97,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The FBI refused."},{"segment_id":98,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At any rate, science continues because the laws of the universe are, in fact, universal, and they can be discovered here or around Alpha Centauri or anyplace else in the cosmos."},{"segment_id":99,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"By 1928 and 29, T.

electromagnetic-gravity effect, the lifter effect that has been described, which you see in UFOs."},{"segment_id":100,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They also can create what's called a space-time bubble around an object so that you can correct for 1G."},{"segment_id":101,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is how these objects are traveling at multiples of what any aerodynamic physics would describe and can make right-hand turns without killing the occupants."},{"segment_id":102,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Around this same time, there was, in the 1940s and the late 1930s, a number of UFO sightings."},{"segment_id":103,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This included the so-called Foo Fighters."},{"segment_id":104,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, it's a famous rock

course, the famous Roswell event."},{"segment_id":111,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Those events led to, as Philip Corso describes, a reverse engineering program, as you all know from the famous Wilbur Smith document of 1951 from Canada."},{"segment_id":112,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It talks about that flying saucers exist, but there's a high-level team headed up by Dr. Vannevar Bush

remember."},{"segment_id":115,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have actionable intelligence from someone who has worked in the National Security Agency and has been in the vault."},{"segment_id":116,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All of this went deep black because they figured out, at that point, gravity control."},{"segment_id":117,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So since 1954, October of that year, we have not needed rockets, jets, internal combustion engines, and surface roadways between cities."},{"segment_id":118,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I say this with authority that this is the case."},{"segment_id":119,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Eventually, these breakthroughs in human discovery were complemented by the study of the extraterrestrial material that were retrieved from these events."},{"segment_id":120,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And contrary to most people's thoughts, the Roswell event was actually a downing of an extraterrestrial vehicle by an electromagnetic system that was hidden in a radar dome that was switched on."},{"segment_id":121,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And this is in an FBI document that I can provide for the committee and is on the flash drive given to the Congress."},{"segment_id":122,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The result, ultimately, was that there were trans-dimensional physics that began to be studied that deal with the nexus between electromagnetism, energy generation, anti-gravity, and consciousness."},{"segment_id":123,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we have discovered that there is a nexus and that, in fact, there are electromagnetic systems that have been developed that can interface directly with what we call coherent thought, the same way that you can interface with a system with lasers, which is coherent light,

cover that came out years later was that the serial disk is also shown on the same magazine cover next to the homopolar."},{"segment_id":173,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I thought this was sort of a coincidence or synchronicity and I ended up investigating the serial disk."},{"segment_id":174,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":175,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I met John Searle in 1980 in Germany and he actually became kind of a curiosity to me."},{"segment_id":176,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Even today he still is."},{"segment_id":177,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He's still a living legend."},{"segment_id":178,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He claimed to have these disks, as you can see here, hovering and he had a UFO experience when he was young and then he started building these things."},{"segment_id":179,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So next slide."},{"segment_id":180,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Basically tried to help him, connected with different people."},{"segment_id":181,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He essentially became a little more well known when he gave a talk in Berlin in 1990."},{"segment_id":182,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then some Russians discovered him because of that lecture and the video and decided to build what they described as a single roller magnet assembly with 12 roller magnets around the outer edge of a ring."},{"segment_id":183,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so I started to think twice of, hey, this may be something related to what was called the Moo disk back in the Paulson book."},{"segment_id":184,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's one of the biographies you can get off the shelf, \"Anti-Gravity, the Dream Made Reality\" by John Thomas."},{"segment_id":185,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":186,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So long story short is that these roller magnets are individual homopolar generators and these definitely seem to lend itself to voltage generation if the whole ring could somehow be propelled."},{"segment_id":187,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's the magic and the mystery behind the whole thing."},{"segment_id":188,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, the Russians had a whole grocery list, as you can see on the right, of all these anomalies that they supposedly measured."},{"segment_id":189,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so what I ended up doing, next slide, was to connect them to an investor, which I constantly do throughout these years, find an investor for the strange inventors, put them together."},{"segment_id":190,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In this case, we went to the Department of Energy."},{"segment_id":191,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The contact was very friendly to us, offered a Russian translator for us."},{"segment_id":192,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We did due diligence for the whole day."},{"segment_id":193,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the investor was comfortable to throw his money at the Russian Godin and Roschin inventions."},{"segment_id":194,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the outcome was, next slide, the big prototype at cost of a lot of money, which was built and completed in Moscow."},{"segment_id":195,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then it was retrofitted and completed again and again."},{"segment_id":196,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And even to this day, it doesn't quite do what it's supposed to do, but it certainly looks interesting."},{"segment_id":197,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":198,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So back to the George Van Tassel story."},{"segment_id":199,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Since this is dealing with implications of extraterrestrial technology, George's story is that he had lots of UFO experiences, even rides on craft and so forth."},{"segment_id":200,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And his, what do you say, his download or his conclusion from all of these experiences was, hey, I'm going to build a healing chamber, a rejuvenation chamber called the Integratron."},{"segment_id":201,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it's right near Giant Rock, I've actually gone out there."},{"segment_id":202,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":203,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it still is in existence today, integratron.com."},{"segment_id":204,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it's all wood construction with no nails."},{"segment_id":205,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":206,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it's very fascinating because it has these unusual die rods."},{"segment_id":207,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The whole assembly of die rods was supposed to rotate."},{"segment_id":208,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it also has a primary and secondary coil inside that looks like an inverted Tesla coil."},{"segment_id":209,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So you get the impression that it would draw atmospheric electricity, since it's very dry there, it's feasible, this would work."},{"segment_id":210,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then charge up the inside with some of this energy."},{"segment_id":211,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":212,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So that concludes the possible rejuvenation implications of ET contact."},{"segment_id":213,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And what I'd like to conclude with is the zero-point energy inertial shielding on electro-gravity."},{"segment_id":214,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":215,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"First of all, zero-point energy is very famous."},{"segment_id":216,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I wrote a book on it."},{"segment_id":217,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I wrote two books, actually."},{"segment_id":218,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it's been confirmed consistently, even up to last week, where our future energy news announced some new polymer pyrrole that actually can't be explained unless two-thirds of it is due to zero-point energy."},{"segment_id":219,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":220,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And here we have the reason why zero-point energy may be important."},{"segment_id":221,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we'll see if she can insert the 30-second video that's supposed to actually start."},{"segment_id":222,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm not sure if we're going to get a video or not."},{"segment_id":223,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But, oh, maybe."},{"segment_id":224,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":225,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":226,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":227,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is an example of many, you've probably seen some of these already, that the craft is spinning, it's up close, it looks like a legitimate, authentic video, amateur video."},{"segment_id":228,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And right about now you're going to see a very fast acceleration."},{"segment_id":229,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's what we've been talking about, folks."},{"segment_id":230,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the important part is that this introduces a concept, which I'd like to share with the panel, and that is inertia is involved."},{"segment_id":231,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And as we get to the next slide, hopefully we can see that, the inertial mass and gravitational mass are totally different."},{"segment_id":232,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I repeat myself."},{"segment_id":233,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Inertial mass and gravitational mass have nothing to do with each other."},{"segment_id":234,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Einstein made a mistake years ago and called it the equivalence principle."},{"segment_id":235,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I studied it even in grad school."},{"segment_id":236,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I took relativity and I took general relativity."},{"segment_id":237,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so it's fascinating to me that it's sort of overlooked."},{"segment_id":238,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Slide right after this."},{"segment_id":239,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the important part is that nowadays, inertia has been discovered to be a zero-point field, Lorentz force, by Hayes, Schwetter, and Puthoff."},{"segment_id":240,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a seminal paper that's so important that it opens the door to actually controlling inertia and understanding how any ET craft or UFOs could possibly have fast acceleration right angle turns and maybe even travel through the universe."},{"segment_id":241,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It turns out F equals V cross B, a simple Lorentz force at the bottom of the slide there showing how it works."},{"segment_id":242,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So when we go around a curve and you feel that force moving you in the opposite direction, it's an electromagnetic interaction."},{"segment_id":243,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":244,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And this applies to relativity."},{"segment_id":245,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I heard one of the gentlemen on the panel questioning special relativity."},{"segment_id":246,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, that's inertial mass."},{"segment_id":247,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That is the M in relativistic increase in mass as you go toward the speed of light."},{"segment_id":248,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you can shield inertial mass, miracles happen."},{"segment_id":249,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And this is another demonstration."},{"segment_id":250,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I showed this slide to the deputy director of the NRO, National Reconnaissance Office, in case you don't know what NRO stands for."},{"segment_id":251,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And this was very important because, as you see, F equals MA, Newton's law, can be modified."},{"segment_id":252,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If M can be shielded and it lowers, then A could increase for the same amount of force."},{"segment_id":253,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":254,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Oh, and by the way, the NRO deputy director said, well, things like this tend to become more and more classified until they're out of sight."},{"segment_id":255,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He says it's easier for us to reinvent it for a private contractor."},{"segment_id":256,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I said, you mean the taxpayers have to pay double for something like this?"},{"segment_id":257,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he said, yes."},{"segment_id":258,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Here's another proof of inertial shielding, and that is the right angle turn that's photographed here with open shutter, 35 millimeter on tripod, 2 a.m. outside Stewart Air Force Base."},{"segment_id":259,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The triangle craft started from the upper part and the shutter was open, made a tremendous right turn, and then continued as if nothing happened."},{"segment_id":260,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Red and green lights make it look like it's conventional."},{"segment_id":261,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":262,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And Dr. Villon, you've got about one minute."},{"segment_id":263,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I understand."},{"segment_id":264,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I see."},{"segment_id":265,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So the conclusion is an electrokinetic equation helps explain how we can combine electrokinetics or electrogravity and inertial shielding."},{"segment_id":266,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Pulsed current will produce a force."},{"segment_id":267,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":268,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I wrote a book on the electrogravity effect that's even present in the B2 bomber thanks to Paul LaViolette's work and research and originally starting with Townsend Brown's research."},{"segment_id":269,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next slide."},{"segment_id":270,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the conclusion is, and I have to give thanks to Mark McCandlish, who gave a testimony of Dr. Greer's 2001 disclosure project in D.C. since we know once in a while such an electrokinetic-powered craft are put on display, as this one was in 1908 in Norton Air Force Base, which is also his entire testimony is reproduced thanks to Mark in my book Electrogravitics 2."},{"segment_id":271,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And this is also verified and investigated by Dr. Hal Putoff, and I talked to him personally about this story of Norton Air Force Base showing three hovercraft, and he did his due diligence with it, and he says he put it in his gray box of possible events."},{"segment_id":272,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":273,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":274,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"[

thank the chair of the committee, Mr. Cook, honorable members of the committee, congressional members, my fellow colleagues that are here, and guests for allowing me to present this material to you today."},{"segment_id":279,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I know we have certain time constraints, so we will do my very best to stay within those time constraints."},{"segment_id":280,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've already submitted a written document which I will read to the committee, and I've also submitted to you some paperwork which is of a scientific nature of our findings."},{"segment_id":281,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I have not stated anything of my own personal background, so I'd like to take a very short period of time to do that."},{"segment_id":282,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I have a degree as a bachelor of science, a doctor of podiatric medicine."},{"segment_id":283,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I did research with Dow Corning for bone replacement implants, I've done participated in research in tendon regeneration, I have a good knowledge of the biological workings of the human body."},{"segment_id":284,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was also, for three years, the chairman of a committee at the Cedars Lebanon Hospital in Hollywood, California, head of the diabetic clinic and director of residency training program at a hospital in Simi Valley, California."},{"segment_id":285,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If anyone had told me at that time that I would be involved in anything in the UFO field or traveled to 42 countries and participated in the things that I have participated in relative to UFOs, I would have said, \"They're nuts.\""},{"segment_id":286,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Strange things have happened in my life that were very synchronistic."},{"segment_id":287,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of these was my cousin's occupation as a Ph.D. psychology professor at the University of Connecticut who wrote a series of books on the near-death experience."},{"segment_id":288,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of the books he wrote was called The Omega Project and it was funded by the University of Connecticut, but the interesting thing was that the story that he was trying to portray or the research project itself was to look for a common psychological profile between those who had UFO experiences and those that had near-death experiences."},{"segment_id":289,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The end result was there wasn't any, it was a totally entirely different subject."},{"segment_id":290,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At that time, I was just getting into the field and he asked me if I would like to have his research material because he no longer was going to be doing anything with UFOs."},{"segment_id":291,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I accepted and expected to get a little package."},{"segment_id":292,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I got boxes and boxes and boxes of material, research work and books from some of the best known authors in the field of ufology."},{"segment_id":293,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, it's a two-way street."},{"segment_id":294,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I came here not only to present information but also to learn information."},{"segment_id":295,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For example, I was very interested to learn that the Eisenhower speech not only talked about the military-industrial complex, but the military-industrial-congressional complex."},{"segment_id":296,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I thought that was very informative."},{"segment_id":297,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I also thought that it was very informative to learn that the oaths that were taken by military officers and other officers in government was to the Constitution of the United States and not to any particular committee or policy."},{"segment_id":298,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I am here also as a student to learn from you."},{"segment_id":299,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What I've planned today and ask you that favor again with time constraints is that at the end of my presentation, I'm allowed to ask you just two questions which may be answered by any one of you that would like to take the challenge of answering it."},{"segment_id":300,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We'll be willing to suspend to do that."},{"segment_id":301,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":302,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I appreciate that, Mr. Chair."},{"segment_id":303,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now I'd like to read the written presentation that I've prepared and submitted to the committee."},{"segment_id":304,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I with my surgical team of medical specialists performed 16 surgeries for the removal of foreign objects from those individuals who allege alien abduction."},{"segment_id":305,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The 16 cases involved the removal of 17 separate and distinct objects."},{"segment_id":306,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of these objects turned out to be a small run of ceramic-like glass which was manufactured by Dow Corning Industries."},{"segment_id":307,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In almost my 50 years of podiatric surgical practice, I have removed literally hundreds or numerous objects from the human foot including paper, glass, metal, stones, hair, coral, many other objects including secret metal."},{"segment_id":308,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At one time, a patient came in with two gentlemen in suits and the proper identification."},{"segment_id":309,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He worked as a machinist for an aerospace company."},{"segment_id":310,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I removed the object and they said, \"Please.\""},{"segment_id":311,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so I handed them the material that I removed from the individual's foot, later come to find out that it was a new material that was experimental for the use of rocket valves and rocketry."},{"segment_id":312,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The individuals involved in this study all presented with no noted portal of entry for any of the objects that were removed."},{"segment_id":313,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was no visible scar formation and there was no interruption of the integrity of the skin even when examination was performed with a magnifying loop, not only examining the area involved but a large amount of the peripheral area."},{"segment_id":314,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All the individuals in the study presented with positive x-rays or CT scans showing metallic or lesser dense foreign objects."},{"segment_id":315,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Prior to the surgical procedures performed, the areas of interest were examined by the use of a gauss meter for magnetic or electromagnetic emissions."},{"segment_id":316,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Ten of them were found to be producing readings on a gauss meter of 6 to 10 milligauss."},{"segment_id":317,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That is a large amount for a very small object that varies in size from approximately 6 to 10 millimetres in length and about the diameter of a pencil head."},{"segment_id":318,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now I understand that from the crew here and some of the television people I've worked with that a modern television camera produces about 4.3 milligauss of emissions."},{"segment_id":319,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So here's a very small object producing 10 milligauss of emissions."},{"segment_id":320,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now in addition to these type of examinations we used frequencies of ultraviolet light to detect fluorescence in the area of the object."},{"segment_id":321,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"About 60% presented with positive UV light fluorescence with colour ranges from pink, green to yellow."},{"segment_id":322,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of the last surgical patients displayed a large chevron appearing area like an insignia on the outside of the right arm near the shoulder."},{"segment_id":323,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He had no prior knowledge of it being there."},{"segment_id":324,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have also found that the removal of this fluorescent material with ordinary solvents only makes them disappear for intervals of approximately one hour."},{"segment_id":325,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And when re-examined again they appear again with the use of ultraviolet light with varying frequencies."},{"segment_id":326,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In addition by use of radio wave frequency detector we were able to detect that certain radio frequencies in the FM band both in the megahertz and kilohertz range were being admitted from the object."},{"segment_id":327,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was determined that in one case the frequencies detected and this is through a chart that I was able to obtain through sources that I will not be able to mention."},{"segment_id":328,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But these frequencies were noted fixed or mobile deep space frequencies."},{"segment_id":329,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Unfortunately our limited budget for performing this research has not allowed us to obtain a radio frequency analyser so that a radio wave could be captured and analysed."},{"segment_id":330,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All the surgeries we performed were documented with eye witnesses, video and still photography."},{"segment_id":331,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We established a chain of criteria and protocols for a forensic chain of custody."},{"segment_id":332,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All the objects were placed in sterile containers using the patient's own blood serum."},{"segment_id":333,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These containers are then signed and not opened again until they reach the laboratories."},{"segment_id":334,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I will skip some of the material because of time constraints."},{"segment_id":335,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We find that in all pathological reports there is no inflammatory reaction."},{"segment_id":336,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There is no rejection reaction."},{"segment_id":337,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There is no inexhaustive research of human science."},{"segment_id":338,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There is nothing that we have found in material science that will produce absolutely no inflammatory reaction in the human body."},{"segment_id":339,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These objects all do."},{"segment_id":340,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Also in addition they are surrounded by a large amount of specialised nerve endings called proprioceptors and these are areas which are not consistent with Grey's anatomy."},{"segment_id":341,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The pathology reports and examination we have sent to material science laboratories."},{"segment_id":342,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Some of these include Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico Tech, University of California at San Diego, Southwest Laboratories in San Antonio, Texas as well as numerous other laboratories outside the country."},{"segment_id":343,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"ANS research scientists and our science board has enabled us to do some of our own scientific studies."},{"segment_id":344,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've already described some of the length and size of the object so we'll skip over that."},{"segment_id":345,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Doctor, I absolutely hate to do this but your time has expired and what we are going to do though is suspend and allow you your request and I would ask the members of the panel to keep their answers, not questions, their answers here as short as possible so that we can at least get five minutes for our questioning of this technology panel that I am."},{"segment_id":346,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"How often do you get to hear from four PhD physicists, scientists, everything else?"},{"segment_id":347,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I want to have plenty of time for our questions but go ahead."},{"segment_id":348,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You want me to finish?"},{"segment_id":349,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, no."},{"segment_id":350,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want you to ask the question if you ask me to change the rules in order to ask."},{"segment_id":351,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What I'd like to ask you number one is do you in your present positions being retired congress people, senator, do you consider the United States to be a world superpower?"},{"segment_id":352,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Anybody that wishes to answer that?"},{"segment_id":353,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In terms of military capability and force, yes."},{"segment_id":354,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In terms of intellectual capacity and moral guidance, no."},{"segment_id":355,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Congressman Kirkpatrick, would you like to add anything?"},{"segment_id":356,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Exactly."},{"segment_id":357,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":358,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now this will be very short, let's assume that what we learned from them up there, let's just assume hypothetically that this is a reality."},{"segment_id":359,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What kind of a position would you think that the United States would be on a world scale if a third world country, a renegade country, would release the entire amount of information to the public of the world?"},{"segment_id":360,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It couldn't do anything."},{"segment_id":361,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In fact, that's one of the things we hope that if the issue is brought before the General Assembly and it's voted to hold a global conference, then that conference will be its own guide, regardless of the United States of America or Britain or any other country, because it will be beyond their control, and that's one of the reasons why I personally would like this issue to go before the General Assembly and not go before the Congress, which I think would just continue the cover up that we've experienced from the government for the last 50 years."},{"segment_id":362,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would say that there's probably not a person in this room that would not agree with you."},{"segment_id":363,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All in all, there's probably a person."},{"segment_id":364,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That is not totally true, what you just said, but I do believe that it would make a huge, huge difference."},{"segment_id":365,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I actually think it would make the people of the world, certainly the people of the United States, even better."},{"segment_id":366,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think if we had absolute knowledge of these things, peace would be more likely, a unified approach towards really finding out answers of other things to eliminate suffering and disease and everything else would be vastly enhanced."},{"segment_id":367,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think there's a lot of wonderful good."},{"segment_id":368,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't necessarily think the United States would slip into second place on anything."},{"segment_id":369,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I have a little bit of difference with my esteemed colleague from Alaska on that."},{"segment_id":370,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've got to say, I'm impressed with the credentials of the people we've heard from, people with doctorate degrees in medicine."},{"segment_id":371,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have, in other words, two that are clearly at the highest levels of biological science, if they're medical degrees, which I assume Dr. Lear and Dr. Greer have."},{"segment_id":372,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think, Dr. Vallone, I think you're a physicist, as is Dr. Wood in the physical area."},{"segment_id":373,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a unique opportunity to hear from physical and biological scientists of great stature and qualification, so I'm going to ask Dr. Wood a question that I started to ask the other panel, which I wouldn't have asked if I'd known this panel was this qualified in the area."},{"segment_id":374,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of the biggest concerns of people, one of the biggest reasons why people don't believe that UFOs have extraterrestrial origins is this whole question of the speed of light."},{"segment_id":375,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm going to ask Robert Wood, how old or large do you think the universe is?"},{"segment_id":376,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You're a physicist."},{"segment_id":377,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You've probably thought about these things."},{"segment_id":378,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think the latest estimate is 20 billion years."},{"segment_id":379,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":380,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"About how large is the Milky Way galaxy, which is just a very tiny little, little part of the universe."},{"segment_id":381,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think the diameter is about 50,000 light years."},{"segment_id":382,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":383,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So 100,000 light years across."},{"segment_id":384,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":385,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":386,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It used to be, in the books at that time it was 50."},{"segment_id":387,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's today."},{"segment_id":388,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's considered to be about 100,000."},{"segment_id":389,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So if we only went 10, tell me if I'm right about this."},{"segment_id":390,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If we were only able to send craft at one-tenth the speed of light, if the universe is 15 or 20 billion years old, which I think you said you'd think, couldn't a spacecraft go from one end of 100,000 light year galaxy to the other end of that galaxy in a period of the time of the, this universe has been in existence 15,000 different times and go back and forth?"},{"segment_id":391,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In other words, why is the speed of light such a big problem?"},{"segment_id":392,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's what I'm trying to understand."},{"segment_id":393,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm not trying to say it stops the idea."},{"segment_id":394,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm saying, am I right that a craft could go 15,000 times from one end of the galaxy to the other in the amount of time that's happened?"},{"segment_id":395,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We think in terms of our own time, but I'd just like you to respond to that."},{"segment_id":396,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I'd like to answer that in two parts."},{"segment_id":397,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The first part has to do with the organizational name we are working with, Paradigm Research Group."},{"segment_id":398,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the idea of paradigm is that the concepts of science get changed suddenly."},{"segment_id":399,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And Newton had a paradigm of F equals MA and Einstein came along and said, now that's not quite right."},{"segment_id":400,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When you go close to the speed of light, you've got different equations."},{"segment_id":401,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so the old paradigm was overthrown."},{"segment_id":402,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My thought here is that the current paradigm that we have that you can't travel faster than the speed of light is it might be overthrown by what Dr. Vallone had said earlier."},{"segment_id":403,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Namely, there's a difference between inertial mass and the meditational mass."},{"segment_id":404,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If we could go the speed of light, it wouldn't be just 15,000 times doing that."},{"segment_id":405,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We could do that 150,000 times."},{"segment_id":406,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In other words, speed of light isn't really a barrier to interstellar travel, is it?"},{"segment_id":407,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In my opinion, the speed of light is not a barrier of travel."},{"segment_id":408,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":409,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's what I wanted to establish."},{"segment_id":410,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Can I comment on this for a moment?"},{"segment_id":411,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah, please."},{"segment_id":412,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because one of the areas that I don't know how much has been talked about prior to today is the whole area of trans-dimensional physics."},{"segment_id":413,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So if you're dealing with three-dimensional space or four-dimensional spacetime, you have one set of equations."},{"segment_id":414,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But when you deal with very high-voltage systems that cause an alteration in what's called the spin, spin theory, mass, and also inertia, you have another whole set of equations which have not been disclosed yet that then become operative so that you can go from here to the end of our galaxy and back controlling for time on Earth right now in a matter of perhaps minutes or days."},{"segment_id":415,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":416,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't question what you're saying."},{"segment_id":417,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This gets into it."},{"segment_id":418,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm going to reclaim the time just to say this."},{"segment_id":419,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I can believe that we do have, yeah, wormholes may well be true and so forth."},{"segment_id":420,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But what I'm trying to say is that the wormhole theories have not been established anywhere near as established as the speed of light and the first relativity theory of Einstein have been established."},{"segment_id":421,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So what I'm trying to say is we don't have to establish, I'm trying to ask you, we don't necessarily have to establish some of these physicists which may well be true that could be established into the future in which there are some interesting indications from even the past that might be happening."},{"segment_id":422,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I'd like to, so will you respond to that?"},{"segment_id":423,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We run a conference on future energy almost every year now."},{"segment_id":424,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It'll be one in July at the University of Maryland again."},{"segment_id":425,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've had David Frohnig there several times as speaker."},{"segment_id":426,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He's a professor from the University of Adelaide in Australia and he particularly has worked on this."},{"segment_id":427,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He actually has simulations of one time to speed light, five times and so forth."},{"segment_id":428,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He treats it just like the sound barrier and he literally has equation comparisons for the speed of sound, speed of light and so forth."},{"segment_id":429,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So my emphasis is trying to make it simple and that is the inertial mass is the key to understanding how this is possible and the special relativity equations which I'm very familiar with only deal with inertial mass."},{"segment_id":430,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So if I could recognize my time really quickly, if we start talking about artificial intelligence being involved in the control of certain vehicles as opposed to natural intelligence being in control, couldn't we also overcome some of these barriers that people have been talking about?"},{"segment_id":431,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean we send artificial intelligence today out into space."},{"segment_id":432,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is that a possibility?"},{"segment_id":433,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The advanced extraterrestrial technologies do deal with technologies that cross into the conscious quantum hologram and directed thought and this is amazing."},{"segment_id":434,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I got to be clear, I hate to cut you off but my time has expired."},{"segment_id":435,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I can't violate what I'm making everybody else live by."},{"segment_id":436,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But we will now go to Congresswoman Wilsey."},{"segment_id":437,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":438,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The first thing I want to do is thank you all for adding an even deeper level of credibility to this hearing that we've had this week."},{"segment_id":439,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":440,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The subject of ufology is so out there that we have to, many of us have to just know that because of who you are, what we're doing is what we should be doing."},{"segment_id":441,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So speaking of what we should be doing, my question to each of you to answer in the time we have is where do you believe that the United States ranks in preparation to meet the global needs for the future?"},{"segment_id":442,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And where will the brilliant students that will become adults like yourselves, only some of them have to be women, come from to meet the numbers we're going to need?"},{"segment_id":443,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, when you asked the question, my immediate reaction was when you said the United States, I asked myself who's really in charge of the answer to your question?"},{"segment_id":444,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so I think the issue which we're dealing with is a truth embargo issue and this enormous secrecy which controls and dominates our entire process, maybe even including the educational process, but if you talk about the ordinary world that we mostly, most of us think that we live in, clearly we need to establish the ideas that new ideas, the discoveries as Stan Friedman said, come from doing things differently in an unpredictable way."},{"segment_id":445,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I think we need to emphasize the importance of creativity in developing the next set of equations that we need and may have already been discovered, but we need to make our society better and stronger."},{"segment_id":446,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":447,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I think we already have everything we need to create a sustainable, poverty-free world."},{"segment_id":448,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's already extant and this is very good news."},{"segment_id":449,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The very bad news is that there is a ruthless, deep national security state that the people I have worked with have run into that is this massive buzzsaw."},{"segment_id":450,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I think that at a certain point, we the people and the Congress and the United Nations and other countries have to come together and say, we've had enough of this nonsense."},{"segment_id":451,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I do not think this is going to come from an executive order from the President."},{"segment_id":452,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think it's going to come from people stepping forward and I wish to emphasize that as I did the other day, that in 1998 we declared these unacknowledged special access projects unconstitutional, a priori illegal."},{"segment_id":453,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we encouraged and we now have over 500 people who have come forward to give us information documents and what have you on this."},{"segment_id":454,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I think we need to continue to do that."},{"segment_id":455,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think we have to say to people who are really not responsive to the people that this is still a world of liberty and we have to be free to know the truth."},{"segment_id":456,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":457,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Very good."},{"segment_id":458,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Dr. Vallone."},{"segment_id":459,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Could I show slide 23, please, as I'm talking?"},{"segment_id":460,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What I'd like to explain is that I agree with our co-panelists and that is the United States already has this technology and I had the privilege of talking with a former black project engineer, spent the whole afternoon with him taking pages and pages of notes, one of which is actually in front of me right here."},{"segment_id":461,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And what I learned is, first of all, he taught me all the details of creating an electro-gravitic layered semiconductor that with bismuth in between and magnesium and zinc, with the same percentages that when slide 23 pops up, you'll see that was published years before in a colleague's book called Secrets of Anti-Gravity Propulsion."},{"segment_id":462,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And Dr. Paul Violette only let me know a year later, he said, \"Oh, this sounds like what I learned from another black project engineer who actually was through Aviation Weekly over in England.\""},{"segment_id":463,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So this is very interesting because my contact told me so many things I couldn't believe, I just took the notes down."},{"segment_id":464,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But after I corroborated this with Linda Moulton-Hull's artifact as well, we have three different corroborations within 1% variation of the same artifact."},{"segment_id":465,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In fact, slide 24, if she gets that up, will also show the actual semiconductor."},{"segment_id":466,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the important part is that we have the technology, students are contacting our Integrity Research Institute all the time saying, \"What should we study?\""},{"segment_id":467,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And this is, I used to be a college teacher, you need the 13 chapters with questions and answers at the end of each chapter."},{"segment_id":468,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the books need to be written, the Zero Point Energy book, the Electro-Vitics book."},{"segment_id":469,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These textbooks are the textbooks of the future and the students are already there waiting to study this stuff."},{"segment_id":470,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So this is the book I'm talking about and if we progress to the next slide, we'll see the actual page that Paul was talking about."},{"segment_id":471,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And this to me was amazing synchronicity."},{"segment_id":472,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I started to believe the other stuff that this black project fellow told me, and that is we already have a base on Mars, which was established in the 1970s, and I said, \"Oh, I don't believe that.\""},{"segment_id":473,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He says, \"Oh, go check the NASA records of the greenhouse gases from Mars' atmosphere."},{"segment_id":474,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They increased in the 1970s.\""},{"segment_id":475,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that was his counterpoint and so forth, he says, \"We have a deep space platform.\""},{"segment_id":476,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He even gave me a jaw dropper and that was the Gulf Breeze UFO conferences that almost amazingly always had a UFO sighting during the conference."},{"segment_id":477,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He says, \"I know the guy who ran that craft, it was a back to engineered craft and he just did it for fun, fly over the UFO conference and create some stir.\""},{"segment_id":478,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So this is the kind of problem we have."},{"segment_id":479,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All right."},{"segment_id":480,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":481,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These boys with toys."},{"segment_id":482,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you, Dr. Lark."},{"segment_id":483,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I have a different approach."},{"segment_id":484,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm very pessimistic."},{"segment_id":485,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I believe that the knowledge, the basic knowledge of all this having to do with the, we've been using the term extraterrestriality as a more general term than it should be used because we really don't understand the entire ramifications of the universe itself."},{"segment_id":486,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't know whether this is a multiverse, whether there are various time areas involved, but someone does know and I believe that at one time at the days of Majestic 12 and Eisenhower and Truman and so on and the state that the world was in, it was necessary to keep this a secret from the public."},{"segment_id":487,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But now I believe, again, I'm sorry to be pessimistic."},{"segment_id":488,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I believe this has moved on from governments, the United States government or any other government into the hands of a greedy industrial complex that does not want it to change."},{"segment_id":489,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Time has expired."},{"segment_id":490,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":491,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We'll now go to Representative Barton."},{"segment_id":492,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":493,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because I want our deliberations to be most favorably perceived, I have one little question I'd like to get cleared up."},{"segment_id":494,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I understand that a bit ago there was a petition being circulated in one of our communities suggesting that the city water work should stop putting dihydrooxide into the water system because if in the future it was determined to be hazardous to health, it could never be removed."},{"segment_id":495,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Dihydrooxide, of course, is water and it's true that if you put it in there, it can never be removed."},{"segment_id":496,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My question has to do with a comment that was made both yesterday and the day before that we're looking at getting energy from water."},{"segment_id":497,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now I'd always thought of water as the ash you get when you burn hydrogen."},{"segment_id":498,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I'm wondering what am I missing here?"},{"segment_id":499,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Unless you're talking about nuclear energy, I'm having some trouble understanding how you get chemical energy from an ash."},{"segment_id":500,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Can you help clear this up for the record?"},{"segment_id":501,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I can."},{"segment_id":502,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we did a great deal of research on this and actually have a proposal that I've given to the chairman for you to look at."},{"segment_id":503,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Stan Meyer and other people have found that using very high voltage systems at certain resonant frequencies causes a recruitment of energy from the ambient zero point energy field that was spoken about so that you can break the hydrogen-oxygen bond."},{"segment_id":504,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So you have two gases that you can burn and when you burn it, the only effluent is water vapor because it recombines."},{"segment_id":505,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now this is actually was done and it was operational and fortunately Stan Meyer died under mysterious conditions and he took those secrets to his grave."},{"segment_id":506,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"His twin brother is still living and people who work with him are still living."},{"segment_id":507,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There are a number of them want to work with us in an R&D project to do this so we convert the internal combustion engines we have now to water engines and this is not a pipe dream."},{"segment_id":508,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is actually something that can be done."},{"segment_id":509,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So my next question, sir, I can believe that they did this, but unless they're violating the second law of thermodynamics, which I don't think we think that you can violate, there's going to be less energy come out than you put into splitting the molecule?"},{"segment_id":510,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's the whole point of what's called an over-unity system."},{"segment_id":511,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Maybe this didn't get covered, is that you're setting up an electromagnetic pointing vector."},{"segment_id":512,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we can violate the second law of thermodynamics?"},{"segment_id":513,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, sir, no, because there's constant conservation of energy, but there's another energy field that hasn't been accounted for, some may call it the Higgs field now."},{"segment_id":514,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you for getting this in the record."},{"segment_id":515,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So there is absolutely no violation of the second law of thermodynamics, none at all, and that's a very important thing to understand."},{"segment_id":516,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You're actually taking energy."},{"segment_id":517,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's been estimated that every cubic centimeter of space in this room has enough energy to run the earth for a day if you could tap it properly through these systems."},{"segment_id":518,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So that means the energy is there, but you have to be able to create a vector into that energy field."},{"segment_id":519,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The zero-point energy field he's talking about, the quantum vacuum, in other words."},{"segment_id":520,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, I just want to clear it up, because I think many people understand chemistry as I do, that water is the ash you get when you burn hydrogen, and it's hard to get energy out of ash, so thank you for clearing that up."},{"segment_id":521,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think that there's a general consensus that if these UFOs are real and if they're extraterrestrial, that they somehow have learned to do what we would love to be able to do, and that is have an anti-gravity thing."},{"segment_id":522,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, I don't know how much we know by reverse engineering these things, how much we know about that, but whatever we know about it, do you think that information is being made available to Stephen Hawking?"},{"segment_id":523,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I haven't heard he died, so I guess he's still alive, and people like him who are trying to harmonize the mysteries of the universe, relativity and gravity and so forth."},{"segment_id":524,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Do you think it's being, I hope it's being made available to them."},{"segment_id":525,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You think not?"},{"segment_id":526,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you're talking about black project discoveries from back engineering, no, I'm sorry, it's the same as in the government."},{"segment_id":527,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They're all in the dark, and they literally are opposed to anything that would violate their little classical laws of physics that they're used to."},{"segment_id":528,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I know I've dealt with professors all my life, and unfortunately it's a big dichotomy between the ivory towers that they sit in and the black project guys that say, \"Hey, the laws of physics need to be rewritten,\" and that exact quote has been used many times for those investigating the black world, it's literally called."},{"segment_id":529,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's not just the laws of physics that have to be rewritten, the laws of physiology have to be rewritten, because if there are entities in these craft, the maneuvers they make, we couldn't survive it."},{"segment_id":530,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, we can."},{"segment_id":531,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's what I tried to explain in my slideshow."},{"segment_id":532,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'd be glad to pull up slide 18 again and slide 17."},{"segment_id":533,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a very important discovery that's been made, and I'm one of the few that have put these things together to describe 17, which is the inertial inertia."},{"segment_id":534,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In other words, inertial mass is now known to be a zero-point energy effect."},{"segment_id":535,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The slide you're looking at right here is slide 18, that's the conclusion of that."},{"segment_id":536,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The previous one, 17, is the journal article that is probably front-page news and should be, because once inertia now is discovered to be an electromagnetic phenomenon, that's an exact breakthrough, in other words."},{"segment_id":537,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If we go back one slide, the journal article obviously is something we need to refer to, because Hal Puthoff was responsible for that."},{"segment_id":538,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Bernie Hayes, who I know personally, was also responsible, and they proved it."},{"segment_id":539,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They

structures."},{"segment_id":748,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we have to remember that in the early days when I was a child, radio, and you got a crystal set with a battery and an air phone, and you were able to get a radio station, that was a marvel."},{"segment_id":749,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So here's a very, very advanced, and when I say nanotechnological, I'm talking about things that are on a level of the size of an atom."},{"segment_id":750,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Using the principle elements of certain materials, putting them together in such a way so that you're actually broadcasting or switching what we perceive as a radio wave, which may not be a radio wave."},{"segment_id":751,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It could be scalar technology, which when reaches our electromagnetic spectrum is converted to a radio wave harmonic, which I know is a little bit complex, but it is sending information to somebody."},{"segment_id":752,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So somebody out there is listening to something going on in our bodies."},{"segment_id":753,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now we know that even John Glenn, when he went into space originally, complained on public television that he had to swallow implants because this was vital information needed on the physiology of the body to know what was going on in space."},{"segment_id":754,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so therefore, your conclusion, you and your team, as it relates to healthcare, as it relates to our country, as it relates to our budget, and to our phenomenon topic we've been talking about today, what do you conclude?"},{"segment_id":755,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I conclude that if there was funding, at least funding, or open-mindedness from the scientific community, which there is not, because they also pray to higher masters."},{"segment_id":756,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They don't want to lose their jobs, they have families to feed, they don't want to look at this stuff in the way that we've looked at it for the benefit of mankind."},{"segment_id":757,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":758,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If we can bring up slide 25, I would like to show 25, 26, and 27 very quickly."},{"segment_id":759,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it is, scalar waves are hugely important, because what Dr. Lear just mentioned is a big, another overcoming of the speed of light problem with electromagnetic waves traveling so slow, there's no communication possible across the Milky Way."},{"segment_id":760,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, it turns out there is, and this is a proof of it, the Chilbolton Crop Circle."},{"segment_id":761,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Based on the Arecibo message that was sent out in 1974, we all of a sudden have this amazing phenomenon that shows a scalar generator, antenna, right at the bottom of the diagram that copies."},{"segment_id":762,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This diagram actually is the original one that was sent out in 1974 from Arecibo."},{"segment_id":763,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's a digital message that was sent out with the most powerful telescope available at the time, thanks to Frank Drake's study program."},{"segment_id":764,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In what happened in 1990, I don't have the exact date here, 2001, August 2001, next slide, there was an appearance of the crop circle overnight right next to a radio telescope in Chilbolton, England."},{"segment_id":765,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the amazing thing was it wasn't just a regular crop circle."},{"segment_id":766,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This thing had almost exactly the same one-to-one correspondence to the Arecibo message."},{"segment_id":767,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Slide 26, please, and then slide 27."},{"segment_id":768,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's exactly what the thing looked like, the crop circle is just a bunch of crops that are down or up, and then the next one is 27."},{"segment_id":769,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we see at the bottom of 27, instead of the Arecibo antenna, which is a parabolic dish, we're seeing something that looks like two circular objects that literally, it says a change in transmitter diameter from one of the online commentaries on Chilbolton."},{"segment_id":770,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the very bottom is something that describes a scalar broadcast antenna that is actually the answer to instantaneous communication across the Milky Way."},{"segment_id":771,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Enough said."},{"segment_id":772,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a big breakthrough."},{"segment_id":773,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":774,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now we'll -- and now we'll go to closing statements from -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee."},{"segment_id":775,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to say thank you for the invitation."},{"segment_id":776,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm certainly a much wiser, better public servant than I was before I walked through these doors."},{"segment_id":777,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"To my panel, my colleagues, you've been excellent."},{"segment_id":778,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Many times we are so busy in Congress, we don't get to know each other unless we travel in what's called congressional delegations and do some work, or work on the committee."},{"segment_id":779,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know best your committee and your caucus."},{"segment_id":780,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And beyond that, these things help."},{"segment_id":781,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So thank you very much."},{"segment_id":782,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And to the staff and all of you."},{"segment_id":783,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"To the witnesses who have been with us all week, outstanding."},{"segment_id":784,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think it's America's loss that none of the press across this country felt the obligation to cover these hearings."},{"segment_id":785,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The information that we've learned, that American people should also have learned, and those who streamed God Bless Them probably did get some of it, will make them better people as we confront the next hundred years, the next thousand years."},{"segment_id":786,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because I really believe, and I wasn't convinced before I came in, but we did a little two-minute interview on the close of this."},{"segment_id":787,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And what I said in mine is, I didn't know before and I still have a lot to learn."},{"segment_id":788,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I'm willing to learn."},{"segment_id":789,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because it's a universal problem and I want my grandchildren and yours, and our great grandchildren to have a universal much to operate."},{"segment_id":790,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So on behalf of this Congresswoman, as I go about my day and catch my plane and hope it lands smoothly, doctors, that I can come back and be with you again."},{"segment_id":791,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've got a lot of work to do."},{"segment_id":792,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I think you educate the people from the bottom up and not from top down."},{"segment_id":793,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It doesn't work like that."},{"segment_id":794,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've done it in revolutions all over this world for hundreds of years."},{"segment_id":795,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a revolutionary issue."},{"segment_id":796,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And if we're going to sustain ourselves as humans, just a part of the universe, we've got work to do."},{"segment_id":797,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"To all of you, and I'm looking and seeing some of you in the audience as you presented to us, thank you for allowing me to be with you."},{"segment_id":798,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":799,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"[ Applause ]"},{"segment_id":800,"speaker_group":2,"source_text":"Yes, thank you, Congresswoman Kilpatrick."},{"segment_id":801,"speaker_group":2,"source_text":"Dr. Bookman, you've got just a minute of announcements before the break."},{"segment_id":802,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Well, first of all, I'd like to say to the honorable representative from Michigan, you ma'am are a hero."},{"segment_id":803,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"You're a hero, just as much as any of these witnesses, when we reached out to former members of Congress, the answer for many was, well, who else is going to be on that committee with me?"},{"segment_id":804,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"I'll serve, but I won't serve with so-and-so, or I want to know who else is there."},{"segment_id":805,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"You agreed to do this not knowing any of that."},{"segment_id":806,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"You stood up and said, \"Yes, I'll do it,\" and opened the space for everyone else to be here."},{"segment_id":807,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Before you leave, I wanted to share that with you."},{"segment_id":808,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"So, you ma'am are our John Glenn, first one up to orbit the earth."},{"segment_id":809,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":810,"speaker_group":4,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":811,"speaker_group":5,"source_text":"That's all."},{"segment_id":812,"speaker_group":5,"source_text":"[ Silence ]"}]
