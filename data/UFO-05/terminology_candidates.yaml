    source_text: I'll give a brief summary of events as I see them before focusing
      on events aspects of the case on which I have more direct knowledge. On December
      26, 1980, two members of the United States Air Force, my colleagues John Burroughs
      and Jim Penniston here, who had been sent to investigate a suspected crashed
      civilian aircraft, encountered an unknown craft which had apparently landed
      in a small clearing. One of them got close enough to see strange hieroglyphic
      symbols on the side and indeed to touch it. The craft rose slowly above the
      trees and then accelerated away at great speed. A subsequent analysis of the
      landing site showed indentations in the ground, scorch marks on the sides of
      the trees and radiation levels which the Ministry of Defence's Defence Intelligence
      staff assessed as being significantly higher than the average background. The
      committee will have a small pack of papers including

      because as the MOD documents released under the UK's Freedom of Information
      Act show some evidence was removed by the US authorities without informing the
      British government. Specifically the MOD case file reveals and the committee
      members will have this document too, that shortly after the incident General
      Gabriel visited the twin bases of Bentwaters and Woodbridge, was briefed on
      the incident and took various items relating to the investigation back to his
      headquarters in Ramstein, Germany. At the time General Gabriel held the post
      of Commander in Chief, United States Air Force in Europe. The MOD document concerned
      though carefully worded leaves little doubt that the UK authorities were less
      than pleased with evidence being removed in this way, with the MOD not being
      informed at the time and

      long and about three inches in height on one side of the craft. The symbols
      Mr. Penniston saw were pictorial and hieroglyphic like in design, the largest
      one being a triangle which was centered in the middle of others. All of the
      symbols were etched into the skin of the craft which was self-warmed to the
      touch and smooth as glass. Approximately 45 minutes after arriving on scene
      with the craft, it rapidly began to brighten. In response, both Penniston and
      Burroughs took defensive positions away from it and watched as the craft became
      airborne without generating any air or sound disturbance. The craft maneuvered
      through the trees as it ascended skyward then streaked away at an unbelievable
      rate of speed. In fact, Mr.

      few months, Senator McCain was able to move up my claim and I was seen by the
      VA in Prescott, Arizona. When I met with the doctor who was reviewing my case,
      we started discussing my case. She looks at me and she says, because I keep
      referring back to 79, 80, and 81. She looks at me directly in the face and says,
      sir, I have no DD form 214 for you from 1979 to 82. It does not show you being
      in the United States Air Force. And supplicantly, I have no records, no medical
      records of you during that time frame. I looked at her and I said, oh, what
      a surprise. That means they're classified. She looked back at me in shock and
      said, there's some things we don't have a need to know. There's people above
      us that handle this.

      up to me that there was no medical records in her file that she had received
      for me from 79 to 82. And she looked at me funny and said, "There's no record
      of you being in the Air Force from 79 to 82." And I pulled out a piece of paper
      that I brought with me showing where I came in the Air Force enlisted in 1979.
      And I also showed her the physical showing that I came in with no heart problems,
      and my exit physical with heart problems. And that changed her attitude towards
      me at that point. And again, like I said, she looked at me and said, "There's
      some things that we don't have need to know." And I said to her, I says, "Well,

      here I am, pushing the craft. It doesn't move. Nothing. As solid as can be.

      we were not being completely honest or with the command element, they should
      have relieved us of duty for 30 days, had a medical evaluation, and then at
      30-day mark, decide whether or not they're going to permanently decertify us
      under PRP or return us to duty. None of that happened. It's because we went
      out and reported what we'd seen. They believed everything we said. And then
      to reinforce it three nights later, Colonel Halt and his team go out. And when
      Colonel Halt called us in the office a few days later, like five days later
      after the first night, I was so happy to hear him say that he had an experience
      out there and he was backing up what I was saying from the first night. I said,
      good, it's off my shoulders. I got a soon-to-be full colonel taking responsibility,
      saying, OK, I'll take the fight from this point on.

      for certain operations, and didn't necessarily mean rentals from any type of
      military operations as classified, and it's up to the gaining command, Army,
      Air Force, or whatever, whether or not they will allow those records to be released
      to the VA so you can receive treatment. She said she came across this recently
      in the past two or three years when she was the same way, was being stymied
      on certain cases involving PTSD and Agent Orange, and that she made this available
      to us. Not only that, but the VA volunteered it again to her, saying that they

      Penniston, you're not totally a believer in ET, but you believe that you saw
      definitely an unidentified maneuvering object. Well, that is solid evidence

      of the Air Force at that time, so I'm trying to just understand did you kind
      of, well, were you being politically correct for a year or two, and then what

      During the process of his investigation, we received a letter, which we have

      best known and most compelling UFO incident is a series of sightings that occurred
      in December 1980 and are collectively known as either the Rendlesham Forest
      incident or the Bentwaters incident. The sightings took place near the twin
      military bases of Bentwaters and Woodbridge. These were bases in the United
      Kingdom operated by the United States Air Force. There were several dozen military
      witnesses, the most senior of whom was the deputy base commander, Lieutenant
      Colonel Charles Halt.

      I received most inquiries from UK parliamentarians, from the media and indeed
      from the public. So as to be able to better respond to these questions I not
      only read all the relevant papers on the case but also launched a retrospective

      (a) an intrusion into our airspace and a landing by unidentified craft took
      place at Rendlesham as described, or (b) the deputy base commander of an operational
      nuclear-armed US Air Force base in England and a large number of his enlisted
      men were either hallucinating or lying." It's difficult to disagree with that
      assessment. In the course of my cold case review, I examined critically all
      the various theories that thought to explain the sightings in conventional terms

      civilian aircraft, encountered an unknown craft which had apparently landed

      referring back to 79, 80, and 81. She looks at me directly in the face and says,
      sir, I have no DD form 214 for you from 1979 to 82. It does not show you being
      in the United States Air Force. And supplicantly, I have no records, no medical

      said, there's some things we don't have a need to know. There's people above

      there by our shift commander and after discussion on the phone was the fact
      that Eastern radar was contacted and notified us that there was some kind of
      object over the base that disappeared in the forest. Because it was off base,
      our jurisdiction was limited. But because the possibility existed that something
      actually crashed in the forest, the decision was made by the shift commander
      to allow us to go out into the forest to investigate. At the same time, the
      local authorities were contacted also. >> Was there a radar track before it

      the approximate dimensions of the vehicle? >> Well, I had to pace them off.
      I took a large stride, so I measured it as nine feet by nine feet by nine feet.
      I'm six foot two, so I measured it estimated at six and a half, seven feet tall.
      We did have berms, earthen berms that was in the forest, and so the area was
      uneven somewhat. It was actually a very small craft, and that was one of the
      puzzling parts of it, is it was just too small for it to be piloted, in my opinion.

      But the craft itself was void of things that aircraft need to fly. I mean, it
      did not have a crew compartment that I could see, did not have exhaust, did
      not have intake. I did not know what the front was. So it was pretty void of
      all those things. And aerodynamically, well, it was a brick. I mean, there's
      no way that thing could fly. And my mindset at the time was that was not going

      night, there was a small incident where they observed lights again in the forest
      moving around and they sent two personnel out to investigate. One of them is
      the on-duty shift commander. At one point, a beam of light shot down at their
      vehicle, threw it, and shut the vehicle off. At that point, she was so upset
      she was relieved of duty and sent home for the rest of the night. On the third
      night, which is the Colonel Halt incident, which

      is clearly partly, or at least partly, being prohibited and what they need to
      do because this incident has been classified.

      want is, okay, an incident happened and we just want to be taken care of over
      it. And there's a lot of other veterans that were working that night. We also
      have access to about 240 of the other security policemen that were stationed
      at that twin bases there. And some of them have similar problems too. And we
      would, we'd like to, you know, we're working for them too, not just ourselves.
      So. >> Have you reconnected with some of the people that were there that night?

      wasn't a question, ma'am, but I want you to know that the wing commander, the

    source_text: What should have happened if there was any suspicion at all that
      we were not being completely honest or with the command element, they should
      have relieved us of duty for 30 days, had a medical evaluation, and then at
      30-day mark, decide whether or not they're going to permanently decertify us
      under PRP or return us to duty. None of that happened. It's because we went
      out and reported what we'd seen. They believed everything we said. And then
      to reinforce it three nights later, Colonel Halt and his team go out. And when
      Colonel Halt called us in the office a few days later, like five days later
      after the first night, I was so happy to hear him say that he had an experience
      out there and he was backing up what I was saying from the first night. I said,
      good, it's off my shoulders. I got a soon-to-be full colonel taking responsibility,
      saying, OK, I'll take the fight from this point on.

      about, McCain and Kyle, I'd like to ask you about Senator James Exon, who was
      a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I understand he said that he
      had spent more time looking into this particular incident than any other case
      in his quote. I think I've got this right. Since I've been a U.S. Senator, while
      he's said that additional information like a seven interagency memorandum is
      on file, he says that he feels there's been no cover-up. Now, why did he say
      that?

      the history of the wing, the 81st Tech Fighter Wing in 1980. When they gave
