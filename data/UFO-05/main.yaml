    I'm general counsel for the committee and I've been involved in this for about
    20 years probably in these kind of hearings since representing Dr. John Mack in
    front of the Harvard Faculty Committee and prior to that time had participated
    as I mentioned in the preparation of a special report from the Congressional Research
    Service to President Carter on this issue back in 1977. Thank you very much sir.
    Madam Congresswoman.

    I had responsibility for the UFO issue from 1991 to 1994. And with your permission
    I'm just going to read a brief statement onto the record. The United Kingdom's
    best known and most compelling UFO incident is a series of sightings that occurred
    in December 1980 and are collectively known as either the Rendlesham Forest incident
    or the Bentwaters incident. The sightings took place near the twin military bases
    of Bentwaters and Woodbridge. These were bases in the United Kingdom operated
    by the United States Air Force. There were several dozen military witnesses, the
    most senior of whom was the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles
    Halt.

      月的目擊事件，統稱為藍道申森林事件（Rendlesham Forest incident）或班特沃特斯事件（Bentwaters incident）。這些目擊事件發生在班特沃特斯（Bentwaters）與伍德布里奇（Woodbridge）這對雙子基地附近。這些是位於英國境內、由美國空軍（United
      States Air Force）營運的基地。有數十名軍方證人，其中軍階最高的是副基地指揮官查爾斯·霍爾特中校（Lieutenant Colonel Charles

  source_text: I'll give a brief summary of events as I see them before focusing on
    events aspects of the case on which I have more direct knowledge. On December
    26, 1980, two members of the United States Air Force, my colleagues John Burroughs
    and Jim Penniston here, who had been sent to investigate a suspected crashed civilian
    aircraft, encountered an unknown craft which had apparently landed in a small
    clearing. One of them got close enough to see strange hieroglyphic symbols on
    the side and indeed to touch it. The craft rose slowly above the trees and then
    accelerated away at great speed. A subsequent analysis of the landing site showed
    indentations in the ground, scorch marks on the sides of the trees and radiation
    levels which the Ministry of Defence's Defence Intelligence staff assessed as
    being significantly higher than the average background. The committee will have

    base commander and a small team of men who had gone to investigate. It later fired
    light beams at a particularly sensitive area of the military base. Though these
    events happened many years before I joined the Ministry of Defence, it was a case

    UFO project between 1991 and 1994. It was certainly the case on which I received
    most inquiries from UK parliamentarians, from the media and indeed from the public.
    So as to be able to better respond to these questions I not only read all the
    relevant papers on the case but also launched a retrospective review of the incident,

  source_text: My cold case review showed that General Gabriel's removal of the evidence
    was one of a number of factors that adversely affected the contemporaneous investigation.
    A combination of confusion over jurisdiction, i.e. between the UK and the US authorities,
    delay and poor information sharing fatally undermine the original investigation.
    Part of the problem was that the US investigation was in of itself a direct contradiction
    of the US government's public line on UFOs, namely that the subject is of no official
    interest and that no official investigations took place after the termination
    of the USAF's investigative program, Project Blue Book, at the end of 1969. This
    clearly put senior United States Air Force officers in an extremely difficult
    position and it was clear to me that the US authorities wished to hand the investigation

      UFO 的公開立場，亦即該主題不具官方關注價值，且在 1969 年底美國空軍調查計畫「藍皮書計畫」（Project Blue Book）終止後，並無官方調查進行。這顯然使美國空軍高階軍官陷入極為困難的處境，我很清楚，美方當局希望將調查移交給英方，而英國國防部同樣急於讓

    Lord Hill Norton said, "My position, both privately and publicly expressed over
    the last dozen years or more, is that there are only two possibilities, either
    (a) an intrusion into our airspace and a landing by unidentified craft took place
    at Rendlesham as described, or (b) the deputy base commander of an operational
    nuclear-armed US Air Force base in England and a large number of his enlisted
    men were either hallucinating or lying." It's difficult to disagree with that
    assessment. In the course of my cold case review, I examined critically all the
    various theories that thought to explain the sightings in conventional terms as
    misidentification, hoax or delusions. None of these theories fitted the facts.

    all kinds of things I wanted it to be because it didn't look like an aircraft
    crash. I was just trying to make it an aircraft crash because we lost contact,
    you know, prior to 15 minutes. I said, "It gave us permission to go off." So I
    started walking around the craft, and I seen the glyphs, and as I, you know, ran
    my hand from the fabric of the craft, it was smooth to touch.

  source_text: Okay. What was summarized, not only in the letter from Senator Cowell's
    office, which says once your claim is being processed and is determined that needed
    records are classified, the request for those records can be made. What the staffer
    told me was that the VA has a section that they maintain records for certain operations,
    and didn't necessarily mean rentals from any type of military operations as classified,
    and it's up to the gaining command, Army, Air Force, or whatever, whether or not
    they will allow those records to be released to the VA so you can receive treatment.
    She said she came across this recently in the past two or three years when she
    was the same way, was being stymied on certain cases involving PTSD and Agent
    Orange, and that she made this available to us. Not only that, but the VA volunteered
    it again to her, saying that they would not even let her know if my records

    text: 好的。凱爾參議員辦公室的信件中總結了這一點，信中說一旦你的申請被處理，並且確定所需記錄被列為機密，就可以提出這些記錄的申請。幕僚告訴我，退伍軍人事務部有一個部門，他們為某些行動保存記錄，這不一定意味著任何類型的軍事行動的記錄都被列為機密，而是由相關指揮單位——陸軍、空軍或其他單位——決定是否允許這些記錄釋出給退伍軍人事務部，以便你能接受治療。她說她在過去兩三年中最近遇到這種情況，她也同樣在涉及創傷後壓力症候群和橙劑的某些案件上受阻，她向我們提供了這些資訊。不僅如此，退伍軍人事務部還主動告訴她，他們甚至不會讓她知道我的記錄

  source_text: Yes, sir. That just came up on our inquiries that are going on now
    that when I did get a little bit of my records released, there was no DD form
    214 in there, and also the fact that the doctor that was interviewing me that
    day said there was no record. Now, that doesn't mean that technically the Air
    Force is saying that I wasn't in. What they're trying to do is show that whatever
    part of the incident took place is classified in my records or in those files,
    and one other interesting note I want to bring up to you, a few years after the
    incident, I went down to Maxwell Air Force Base, and I went into the, you know
    how they keep the history of the wings in the base. I went in and requested the
    history of the wing, the 81st Tech Fighter Wing in 1980. When they gave me the
    files, December of 1980 was missing. It was pulled and was classified.

    text: 是的，先生。這剛好在我們正在進行的調查中出現，當我取得一小部分記錄時，裡面沒有 DD-214 表格，而且那天訪談我的醫生說沒有記錄。現在，這並不意味著空軍在技術上說我不在軍中。他們試圖做的是表明事件發生的任何部分都在我的記錄或那些檔案中被列為機密，我還想向你們提出另一個有趣的細節，事件發生後幾年，我去了麥克斯威爾空軍基地，我進入了⋯⋯你知道他們如何在基地保存聯隊的歷史。我進去要求查閱聯隊的歷史，1980
      年的第 81 戰術戰鬥機聯隊。當他們給我檔案時，1980 年 12 月的部分不見了。它被抽出並列為機密了。

    making a statement here. I just wanted to get a better sense of it.
