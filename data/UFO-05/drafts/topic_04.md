## Speaker Group 1

44. Thank you madam. My name is Tech Sergeant John Burroughs, United States retired. In December 1980 I was assigned to the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Bentwaters which at the time was the largest tech fighter wing in the United States Air Force. During the opening day of testimony you were exposed to the history of UFOs and the cover up that's taking place.

45. Today you will be hearing from military personnel who are involved in some of these incidents.

46. One of the factors that I feel is being overlooked is the human toll that takes place with the witnesses that are involved in these incidents. Our job was to investigate and report back in what we observed. What we were not prepared for is what happened to us afterwards. In our case we were not only let down by our chain of command but there's also evidence showing that we were brought in and interrogated by OSI and other agencies. What you're about to hear is what happened to us in the forest, the investigation took place afterwards and the evidence showing our incident is still classified 32 years later. Thank you. Were there other witnesses of this craft other than the two of you? Yes, on the first night there was a security flight that was working and then also a law enforcement flight that was working and that totaled somewhere between 40 and 60 people at varied. It was over the

47. Christmas holidays plus we had a number of civilian witnesses that came forward later on. Were there any but you two who were close to the craft and saw it on the ground or do the others simply see it leaving and coming? On Bentwaters, the bases are two bases that are geographically separated by three miles of Rendlesham Forest. The main operating base is on Bentwaters. That's where all the control centers are. Now the security forces working that night that were on Bentwaters, I think it was about 13 of them seen at land.

48. Then everybody else that was working our restrict areas on Woodbridge at Charlie and Delta area, they seen the object in the woods but it was mostly a dome of light that was over the woods and as far as getting direct contact with the vehicle itself was John and I and Kabancik.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. But everybody that was working on Woodbridge base that night and Bentwaters base that night seen it take off. That was observed by everybody. When it landed, I gather that it was not detailed enough so there was some concern that it might be a crash of one of our aircraft? Well, when I approached the craft itself, we were familiar with all types of aircraft and silhouettes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. We practiced routinely. We could tell by looking at the silhouettes what kind of aircraft they were Warsaw Pack or if they were Chinese or ours. But the craft itself was void of things that aircraft need to fly. I mean, it did not have a crew compartment that I could see, did not have exhaust, did not have intake. I did not know what the front was. So it was pretty void of all those things. And aerodynamically, well, it was a brick. I mean, there's no way that thing could fly. And my mindset at the time was that was not going anywhere. It was just going to stay there. So I had all the time in the world.

## Speaker Group 2

51. Can I take a second to add to that? The reason why we were sent out there by our shift commander and after discussion on the phone was the fact that Eastern radar was contacted and notified us that there was some kind of object over the base that disappeared in the forest. Because it was off base, our jurisdiction was limited. But because the possibility existed that something actually crashed in the forest, the decision was made by the shift commander to allow us to go out into the forest to investigate. At the same time, the local authorities were contacted also. >> Was there a radar track before it landed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. It was picked up on radar before it landed? >> Yes, what we were informed was Eastern radar, our local radar, both picked up something on radar over the forest area outside of Woodbridge Airport space. >> Okay. What were the approximate dimensions of the vehicle? >> Well, I had to pace them off. I took a large stride, so I measured it as nine feet by nine feet by nine feet. I'm six foot two, so I measured it estimated at six and a half, seven feet tall. We did have berms, earthen berms that was in the forest, and so the area was uneven somewhat. It was actually a very small craft, and that was one of the puzzling parts of it, is it was just too small for it to be piloted, in my opinion. >> Was there any investigation of the landing site? Was it cordoned off, and did experts come to see what artifacts might have been
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. left there? >> Yes, well, the security forces did, besides obviously us two, did an investigation the following morning, which included several security personnel, and then also about a week later, a little less, Colonel Halt informed us that a team from Langley came in, and they cordoned the whole area off on the east end of adjacent to the east gate where the area was, and they provided their own entry control, and they wouldn't allow us in the area. They were there a few days, and then left, packed up and left. >> The documentation relative to this, is it now existing, or has it been lost, destroyed? >> May I take that, please?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

54. Yes, sir. >> Yes, the British government's file on this incident has been declassified and released under the UK Freedom of Information Act, and you should all have in front of you Colonel Halt's initial memo to the Ministry of Defence, which certainly mentions the radiation readings that were taken at the landing site by a number of people, including the disaster preparedness officer, Monroe Nevels, who did the assessment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. You should also have in your pack a British government document, again released under the Freedom of Information Act in the UK, which is the defence intelligence staff assessment of those radiation levels that were reported to us, and you'll see that that document suggests that the readings were about seven times higher. >> One more, please. Thank you. Continue.

## Speaker Group 4

56. Those who debunk the whole UFO thing, what do they do with this incident? How do they explain it away? I mean, it was real, you saw it, it was tracked on radar. How do they explain it away? >> We believe the cover-up started within 24 hours after the incident. There was an individual sat downtown and made contact with some of the local, what they call reporters and investigators that were involved in UFOs, and it was spread around that there was some kind of alien contact in the forest. Also what went on after that was there was a debunker that came forward and tried to explain it away as either Colonel Halt, who was a combat controller prior to becoming command officer, that he was either fooled by stars, planets, or the local lighthouse. >> Well, how did they explain the radar track?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

57. It's just like all the other documents that we present. They just try to downplay what we have. >> They're not talkable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

58. They're not talkable. >> Yeah, I've had a very long-time curiosity and interest in this, and my major concern has been what do you do with those sightings that were accompanied by a radar track? You know, you can have searchlights off of clouds and they can appear to move very, very rapidly and the eyes can be fooled. But, you know, when you have both a visual sighting, several people seeing it, and picked up on radar, you can't just wish that went away. And I'm just curious how they deal with those number of incidents that have both visual sightings and a radar track, and in this case, you know, a landing. And am I to understand that there are few existing records that the records of this incident, like those of Roswell, are gone? >> Some of the paperwork has survived, but to answer the specific question about how governments deal with UFOs that are simultaneously
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. tracked on radar, in my experience at the Ministry of Defense, the issue is decoupled.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. In other words, the Ministry of Defense will then say, when responding to questions, radar is not an exact science and anomalous returns can arise through faults or through meteorological effects. So governments will typically downplay the radar in that way, and then, as I say, decouple it from the eyewitness testimony, as if they were two separate issues.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

61. That is true. You can have spurious results. But when that is accompanied by visual sightings, doesn't it give that some credibility to the radar track?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

62. It does, yes, sir. But that's simply how the Ministry of Defense would downplay that issue. >> Officially in Britain, is this handled the same way it is in our country, just denial that it exists?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

63. The Ministry of Defense UFO project was based very much on the United States Air Force program Project Blue Book, right from the terms of reference through to the investigative methodology. And, yes, very much the conclusion was we accept that people do see strange things that can't always be explained, but we do not believe these things to be of any defense interest or significance. That was the party line.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

64. You know, a few of these, one here and one there, and it's easy to accept that that might be just hallucination or something, but when there are so many, so many different places over so many years, doesn't it become pretty much obligatory that something's, that we recognize that something's there? >> I agree. And, indeed, that's one of the reasons why I continue to speak out on this issue. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Defense's UFO project was the victim of defense cuts in 2009 and has now gone the same way as the USAAF program Project Blue Book. >> I think that this attempt to cover up, clearly there is that attempt to cover up, reflects an attitude on leadership about the general public that I have a lot of trouble with, that somehow the general public is not able to cope with something like this, that they have to be protected, that they would panic,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. that they're too dumb to understand or something like that. I just don't think that this is the way that our general public ought to be viewed. If it's out there, if it's real, we have a right to know. And the government, which covers it up, they can cover that up and make assumptions about what I ought to know, what I ought not to know. That gives me a lot of concern. Thank you very much for your testimony.
