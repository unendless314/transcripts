## Speaker Group 1

44. Thank you madam. My name is Tech Sergeant John Burroughs, United States retired. In December 1980 I was assigned to the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Bentwaters which at the time was the largest tech fighter wing in the United States Air Force. During the opening day of testimony you were exposed to the history of UFOs and the cover up that's taking place.
→ {"text": "謝謝您，女士。我是技術軍士約翰·巴勒斯，美國空軍退役。1980 年 12 月，我被派駐至 RAF Bentwaters 的第 81 戰術戰鬥機聯隊，該聯隊當時是美國空軍規模最大的戰術戰鬥機聯隊。在聽證會開幕日的證詞中，您已經了解到不明飛行物的歷史以及正在進行的真相掩蓋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. Today you will be hearing from military personnel who are involved in some of these incidents.
→ {"text": "今天，您將聽取參與這些事件的軍事人員的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. One of the factors that I feel is being overlooked is the human toll that takes place with the witnesses that are involved in these incidents. Our job was to investigate and report back in what we observed. What we were not prepared for is what happened to us afterwards. In our case we were not only let down by our chain of command but there's also evidence showing that we were brought in and interrogated by OSI and other agencies. What you're about to hear is what happened to us in the forest, the investigation took place afterwards and the evidence showing our incident is still classified 32 years later. Thank you. Were there other witnesses of this craft other than the two of you? Yes, on the first night there was a security flight that was working and then also a law enforcement flight that was working and that totaled somewhere between 40 and 60 people at varied. It was over the

47. Christmas holidays plus we had a number of civilian witnesses that came forward later on. Were there any but you two who were close to the craft and saw it on the ground or do the others simply see it leaving and coming? On Bentwaters, the bases are two bases that are geographically separated by three miles of Rendlesham Forest. The main operating base is on Bentwaters. That's where all the control centers are. Now the security forces working that night that were on Bentwaters, I think it was about 13 of them seen at land.
→ {"text": "聖誕假期，而且我們還有一些平民目擊者後來挺身作證。除了你們兩位之外，還有其他人靠近飛行器並看到它在地面上嗎？還是其他人只是看到它離開和到來？在班特沃特斯，這兩座基地在地理上被三英里的藍道申森林分隔開。主要作戰基地在班特沃特斯，所有的控制中心都在那裡。當晚在班特沃特斯值勤的安全部隊，我記得大約有 13 人看到它著陸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. Then everybody else that was working our restrict areas on Woodbridge at Charlie and Delta area, they seen the object in the woods but it was mostly a dome of light that was over the woods and as far as getting direct contact with the vehicle itself was John and I and Kabancik.
→ {"text": "而在伍德布里奇基地查理區和德爾塔區的管制區工作的其他人員，他們在樹林中看到了那個物體，但主要是樹林上方的一個光穹。至於直接接觸飛行器本身的，只有約翰、我和卡班希克。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. But everybody that was working on Woodbridge base that night and Bentwaters base that night seen it take off. That was observed by everybody. When it landed, I gather that it was not detailed enough so there was some concern that it might be a crash of one of our aircraft? Well, when I approached the craft itself, we were familiar with all types of aircraft and silhouettes.
→ {"text": "但是那晚在伍德布里奇基地和班特沃特斯基地工作的所有人都看到它起飛。每個人都目擊了這一幕。當它著陸時，我理解資訊不夠詳細，所以有人擔心可能是我們的飛機墜毀？嗯，當我接近飛行器本身時，我們對所有類型的飛機和輪廓都很熟悉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. We practiced routinely. We could tell by looking at the silhouettes what kind of aircraft they were Warsaw Pact or if they were Chinese or ours. But the craft itself was void of things that aircraft need to fly. I mean, it did not have a crew compartment that I could see, did not have exhaust, did not have intake. I did not know what the front was. So it was pretty void of all those things. And aerodynamically, well, it was a brick. I mean, there's no way that thing could fly. And my mindset at the time was that was not going anywhere. It was just going to stay there. So I had all the time in the world.
→ {"text": "我們經常進行演練。我們可以通過觀察輪廓辨別飛機的種類——是華沙公約國家的、中國的還是我們自己的。但這架飛行器缺少飛機飛行所需的一切。我是說，我看不到它有機組艙室，沒有排氣口，沒有進氣口。我不知道哪邊是前方。所以它完全缺少所有這些東西。而且從空氣動力學角度來看，它就是一塊磚頭。我是說，那東西根本不可能飛行。我當時的想法是它哪裡也去不了，就會待在那裡。所以我有的是時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 2

51. Can I take a second to add to that? The reason why we were sent out there by our shift commander and after discussion on the phone was the fact that Eastern radar was contacted and notified us that there was some kind of object over the base that disappeared in the forest. Because it was off base, our jurisdiction was limited. But because the possibility existed that something actually crashed in the forest, the decision was made by the shift commander to allow us to go out into the forest to investigate. At the same time, the local authorities were contacted also. >> Was there a radar track before it landed?
→ {"text": "我可以補充一點嗎？我們的輪班指揮官在電話討論後派我們出去的原因是，東部雷達站聯絡並通知我們，基地上空有某種物體消失在森林中。因為它在基地外，我們的管轄權有限。但由於存在某物實際墜毀在森林中的可能性，輪班指揮官做出決定，允許我們進入森林調查。同時，當地政府機關也被聯絡了。在它著陸之前有雷達追蹤嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. It was picked up on radar before it landed? >> Yes, what we were informed was Eastern radar, our local radar, both picked up something on radar over the forest area outside of Woodbridge Airport space. >> Okay. What were the approximate dimensions of the vehicle? >> Well, I had to pace them off. I took a large stride, so I measured it as nine feet by nine feet by nine feet. I'm six foot two, so I measured it estimated at six and a half, seven feet tall. We did have berms, earthen berms that was in the forest, and so the area was uneven somewhat. It was actually a very small craft, and that was one of the puzzling parts of it, is it was just too small for it to be piloted, in my opinion. >> Was there any investigation of the landing site? Was it cordoned off, and did experts come to see what artifacts might have been
→ {"text": "它在著陸前被雷達捕捉到了？是的，我們得到的資訊是東部雷達站和我們的本地雷達都在伍德布里奇機場空域外的森林區域上空的雷達上捕捉到某物。好的。這個飛行器的大致尺寸是多少？嗯，我必須用步伐來測量。我跨大步測量，所以測得它大約是九英呎乘九英呎乘九英呎。我身高六英呎二英吋，所以我估算它高度約六英呎半到七英呎。森林中有土堤，所以該區域有些不平坦。這實際上是一架非常小的飛行器，這也是令人困惑的部分之一——依我看來，它太小了，不可能有人駕駛。著陸地點有進行任何調查嗎？現場有被封鎖嗎？有專家來查看可能留下的", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. left there? >> Yes, well, the security forces did, besides obviously us two, did an investigation the following morning, which included several security personnel, and then also about a week later, a little less, Colonel Halt informed us that a team from Langley came in, and they cordoned the whole area off on the east end of adjacent to the east gate where the area was, and they provided their own entry control, and they wouldn't allow us in the area. They were there a few days, and then left, packed up and left. >> The documentation relative to this, is it now existing, or has it been lost, destroyed? >> May I take that, please?
→ {"text": "物件嗎？是的，嗯，除了我們兩人之外，安全部隊在隔天早上進行了調查，包括數名安全人員參與，然後大約一週後，稍微不到一週，霍爾特中校告訴我們，一支來自蘭利基地的團隊來了，他們在東端靠近東門的區域把整個區域封鎖起來，他們自己設置出入管制，不允許我們進入該區域。他們在那裡待了幾天，然後打包離開了。與此相關的文件記錄，現在還存在嗎？還是已經遺失或被銷毀了？我可以回答這個問題嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

54. Yes, sir. >> Yes, the British government's file on this incident has been declassified and released under the UK Freedom of Information Act, and you should all have in front of you Colonel Halt's initial memo to the Ministry of Defence, which certainly mentions the radiation readings that were taken at the landing site by a number of people, including the disaster preparedness officer, Monroe Nevels, who did the assessment.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。是的，英國政府關於此事件的檔案已根據英國資訊自由法解密並公開，您們面前應該都有霍爾特中校致英國國防部的最初備忘錄，其中確實提到了在著陸地點由多人測得的輻射讀數，包括災害應變官員門羅·內維爾斯進行的評估。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. You should also have in your pack a British government document, again released under the Freedom of Information Act in the UK, which is the defence intelligence staff assessment of those radiation levels that were reported to us, and you'll see that that document suggests that the readings were about seven times higher. >> One more, please. Thank you. Continue.
→ {"text": "您們的資料包中還應該有一份英國政府文件，同樣根據英國資訊自由法公開，那是國防情報人員對向我們報告的輻射水平所做的評估，您們會看到該文件顯示讀數大約高出七倍。再一個問題，請。謝謝。請繼續。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

56. Those who debunk the whole UFO thing, what do they do with this incident? How do they explain it away? I mean, it was real, you saw it, it was tracked on radar. How do they explain it away? >> We believe the cover-up started within 24 hours after the incident. There was an individual sat downtown and made contact with some of the local, what they call reporters and investigators that were involved in UFOs, and it was spread around that there was some kind of alien contact in the forest. Also what went on after that was there was a debunker that came forward and tried to explain it away as either Colonel Halt, who was a combat controller prior to becoming command officer, that he was either fooled by stars, planets, or the local lighthouse. >> Well, how did they explain the radar track?
→ {"text": "那些駁斥整個不明飛行物現象的人，他們如何處理這起事件？他們如何解釋它？我是說，它是真實的，你們看到了，雷達也追蹤到了。他們如何解釋它？我們相信真相掩蓋在事件發生後 24 小時內就開始了。有個人坐在市區，與一些當地的、他們所謂的參與不明飛行物調查的記者和調查員取得聯繫，散播說森林中發生了某種外星接觸。在那之後發生的事情是，有個駁斥者站出來，試圖將其解釋為霍爾特中校（他在成為指揮官之前是戰鬥管制員）被星星、行星或當地的燈塔所愚弄。那麼，他們如何解釋雷達追蹤？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

57. It's just like all the other documents that we present. They just try to downplay what we have. >> They're not talkable.
→ {"text": "就像我們提出的所有其他文件一樣。他們只是試圖淡化我們擁有的證據。它們是無法談論的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

58. They're not talkable. >> Yeah, I've had a very long-time curiosity and interest in this, and my major concern has been what do you do with those sightings that were accompanied by a radar track? You know, you can have searchlights off of clouds and they can appear to move very, very rapidly and the eyes can be fooled. But, you know, when you have both a visual sighting, several people seeing it, and picked up on radar, you can't just wish that went away. And I'm just curious how they deal with those number of incidents that have both visual sightings and a radar track, and in this case, you know, a landing. And am I to understand that there are few existing records that the records of this incident, like those of Roswell, are gone? >> Some of the paperwork has survived, but to answer the specific question about how governments deal with UFOs that are simultaneously
→ {"text": "它們是無法談論的。是的，我對此有長期的好奇心和興趣，我主要關心的是，對於那些伴隨雷達追蹤的目擊事件，你們如何處理？你知道，雲層上的探照燈可能看起來移動得非常、非常快，眼睛可能會被欺騙。但是，你知道，當你同時擁有視覺目擊——數人看到它——並且雷達也捕捉到時，你不能就這樣希望它消失。我只是好奇他們如何處理那些既有視覺目擊又有雷達追蹤的大量事件，而且在這個案例中，你知道，還有著陸。我理解的是，現存的記錄很少，這起事件的記錄，就像羅斯威爾事件的記錄一樣，都不見了？一些文件記錄倖存下來了，但要回答關於政府如何處理同時", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

59. tracked on radar, in my experience at the Ministry of Defense, the issue is decoupled.
→ {"text": "被雷達追蹤到的不明飛行物的具體問題，根據我在英國國防部的經驗，問題是被解耦的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. In other words, the Ministry of Defense will then say, when responding to questions, radar is not an exact science and anomalous returns can arise through faults or through meteorological effects. So governments will typically downplay the radar in that way, and then, as I say, decouple it from the eyewitness testimony, as if they were two separate issues.
→ {"text": "換句話說，英國國防部在回應問題時會說，雷達不是一門精確的科學，異常回波可能因故障或氣象效應而產生。所以政府通常會以這種方式淡化雷達證據，然後，如我所說，將其與目擊者證詞解耦，彷彿它們是兩個獨立的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

61. That is true. You can have spurious results. But when that is accompanied by visual sightings, doesn't it give that some credibility to the radar track?
→ {"text": "這是真的。可能會有虛假結果。但當它伴隨視覺目擊時，難道不會為雷達追蹤增添一些可信度嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

62. It does, yes, sir. But that's simply how the Ministry of Defense would downplay that issue. >> Officially in Britain, is this handled the same way it is in our country, just denial that it exists?
→ {"text": "確實會，是的，先生。但這就是英國國防部淡化該問題的方式。在英國官方層面上，這件事的處理方式與我們國家一樣，只是否認它的存在嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

63. The Ministry of Defense UFO project was based very much on the United States Air Force program Project Blue Book, right from the terms of reference through to the investigative methodology. And, yes, very much the conclusion was we accept that people do see strange things that can't always be explained, but we do not believe these things to be of any defense interest or significance. That was the party line.
→ {"text": "英國國防部的不明飛行物專案很大程度上是基於美國空軍的藍皮書計畫，從職權範圍到調查方法都是如此。是的，結論基本上是我們承認人們確實會看到無法總是解釋的奇怪事物，但我們不相信這些事物具有任何國防利益或重要性。那是官方立場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

64. You know, a few of these, one here and one there, and it's easy to accept that that might be just hallucination or something, but when there are so many, so many different places over so many years, doesn't it become pretty much obligatory that something's, that we recognize that something's there? >> I agree. And, indeed, that's one of the reasons why I continue to speak out on this issue. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Defense's UFO project was the victim of defense cuts in 2009 and has now gone the same way as the USAAF program Project Blue Book. >> I think that this attempt to cover up, clearly there is that attempt to cover up, reflects an attitude on leadership about the general public that I have a lot of trouble with, that somehow the general public is not able to cope with something like this, that they have to be protected, that they would panic,
→ {"text": "你知道，這裡一起那裡一起，少數幾起，很容易接受那可能只是幻覺或其他什麼，但當有這麼多起、在這麼多不同地點、持續這麼多年時，難道不是幾乎必然要承認有某種東西存在嗎？我同意。事實上，這是我持續就此議題發聲的原因之一。不幸的是，英國國防部的不明飛行物專案在 2009 年成為國防預算削減的受害者，現在已經走上了與美國陸軍航空軍藍皮書計畫相同的道路。我認為這種試圖掩蓋真相的行為——顯然存在這種試圖掩蓋真相的行為——反映了領導層對一般大眾的態度，而我對此有很大的困擾，認為一般大眾無法應對這樣的事情，認為他們必須被保護，認為他們會恐慌，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. that they're too dumb to understand or something like that. I just don't think that this is the way that our general public ought to be viewed. If it's out there, if it's real, we have a right to know. And the government, which covers it up, they can cover that up and make assumptions about what I ought to know, what I ought not to know. That gives me a lot of concern. Thank you very much for your testimony.
→ {"text": "認為他們太愚蠢而無法理解之類的。我只是不認為這是看待我們一般大眾應有的方式。如果它存在，如果它是真實的，我們有權知道。而政府掩蓋真相，他們可以掩蓋真相並對我應該知道什麼、不應該知道什麼做出假設。這讓我非常擔憂。非常感謝你們的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
