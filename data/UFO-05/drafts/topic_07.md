193. Can I bring up a point, ma'am?
→ {"text": "我能提出一個觀點嗎，女士？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. Yes, please.
→ {"text": "是的，請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. All right. You told us to be aggressive. Where was our chain of command when it came for them to be aggressive? After the incident happened, we were brought in and interrogated.
→ {"text": "好的。您告訴我們要積極主動。那麼當需要他們積極主動時，我們的指揮鏈在哪裡？事件發生後，我們被帶去審訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "chain of command 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「指揮鏈」"}

196. They did nothing to stop that. They did nothing to step up and make sure that we were treated medically after the incident. OK, the chain of command is clearly partly, or at least partly, being prohibited and what they need to do because this incident has been classified.
→ {"text": "他們沒有採取任何行動阻止。他們沒有站出來確保我們在事件後獲得醫療照護。好的，指揮鏈顯然部分地、或至少部分地被禁止去做他們該做的事，因為這起事件已被列為機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. And not only has it been classified, it's been classified and kept away from the people that serve this country, which is the Senate and House of Representatives, the United States of America. And we're trying to do what we're trying to do, but at the same time, where are we going to go when people like Senator Kyl are prohibited from receiving records?
→ {"text": "而且它不僅被列為機密，還被隱瞞於為國家服務的人——也就是美國參議院和眾議院之外。我們正在努力做我們該做的事，但同時，當像凱爾參議員這樣的人都被禁止取得記錄時，我們還能去哪裡？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Senator Kyl 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「凱爾參議員」"}

198. Yeah. I was going to say . . .
→ {"text": "是的，我正要說⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. He . . .
→ {"text": "他⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. Go to a House member.
→ {"text": "去找眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. Yeah. You have to . . . I tell this to . . . when I was in Congress, I told this to every person that came in that wanted anything or wanted any help.
→ {"text": "是的。你必須⋯⋯我告訴⋯⋯當我在國會任職時，我對每個來尋求任何幫助的人都這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. Excuse me. I yield the Congress home additional two minutes.
→ {"text": "抱歉，我讓給國會議員額外兩分鐘。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "'Congress home' 可能是轉錄錯誤，應為 'Congresswoman'，但根據上下文翻譯"}

203. All right. You also have to be very persistent with that member that you're dealing with, whether it's a Senator or a House member. You have to be persistent and say, "What have you found out? Is anything happening?" And talk to . . . I mean, if they've . . . most members have really great staff, talk to the staff and you just have to be just pound on them that you need to have this information. But I so appreciate you telling us this story.
→ {"text": "好的。你也必須對你打交道的議員非常堅持，無論是參議員還是眾議員。你必須堅持不懈地問：「你發現了什麼？有任何進展嗎？」還要跟⋯⋯我是說，如果他們⋯⋯大多數議員都有非常優秀的幕僚，跟幕僚談，你必須不斷向他們強調你需要這些資訊。但我非常感謝你們告訴我們這個故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. It's . . . I am embarrassed for our military that they don't come forward with the information so that you can get the kind of treatment that you need. So thank you, first of all, for serving. Again, I hope that there will be people that will step forward. You have to be consistent, be persistent, and hopefully you'll get the information you need. Thank you.
→ {"text": "這⋯⋯我為我們的軍方感到羞愧，他們不願意提供資訊讓你們獲得所需的治療。首先，感謝你們的服役。再次希望會有人站出來。你們必須持之以恆、堅持不懈，希望你們能得到所需的資訊。謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. Thank you, Congresswoman.
→ {"text": "謝謝您，眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. I yield back.
→ {"text": "我讓回時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "yield back 是國會程序用語，表示交還發言時間"}

207. Thank you, Congresswoman. Congressman Cook?
→ {"text": "謝謝您，眾議員。庫克眾議員？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Congressman Cook 依照 terminology.yaml 為 Merrill Cook（梅里爾·庫克）"}

208. Yes. You know, I want to say that for any open-minded Americans out there, no matter how skeptical, this is very interesting stuff we're hearing today. Extremely interesting.
→ {"text": "是的。你知道，我想說，對於任何心胸開放的美國人，無論他們多麼懷疑，我們今天聽到的都是非常有趣的內容。極其有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. And I'm surprised that not more Americans know about this Rendlesham Forest incident.
→ {"text": "我很驚訝沒有更多美國人知道這起藍道申森林事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Rendlesham Forest incident 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「藍道申森林事件」"}

210. I'd like to ask . . . and I want to commend both sergeants for their service to our country and apologize for the United States government, even though I'm not in any official capacity at the moment for withholding important information. But let me start, Sergeant Burroughs, by asking you, you enlisted in the Air Force when you were . . . or in the year 1979, I think you said.
→ {"text": "我想問⋯⋯我要讚揚兩位軍士對國家的服務，並為美國政府隱瞞重要資訊道歉，儘管我目前不具任何官方身分。但讓我先問巴勒斯軍士，你入伍空軍時⋯⋯或者說在 1979 年，我想你是這麼說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Sergeant Burroughs 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「巴勒斯軍士」"}

211. Yes, sir, 1979.
→ {"text": "是的，先生，1979 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. Okay. And how old were you at the time?
→ {"text": "好的。那你當時幾歲？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. I would have been 18 years old.
→ {"text": "我當時應該是 18 歲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. Okay. And how old were you when you were made sergeant in the United States Air Force?
→ {"text": "好的。那你幾歲時在美國空軍晉升為軍士？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. I believe I was . . . I was 22 or 23 when I received my E-Force status. I can't remember exactly.
→ {"text": "我記得我⋯⋯我獲得 E-Force 階級時是 22 或 23 歲。我記不太清楚了。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "E-Force 可能指 E-4 階級（Air Force 的 Senior Airman），保留原文"}

216. Okay. So that would have been about 1982, '83? '82 or '83, if I'm correct.
→ {"text": "好的。那麼應該是 1982、83 年左右？如果我沒算錯的話，82 或 83 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. Okay. After the Rendlesham Forest incident?
→ {"text": "好的。在藍道申森林事件之後？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. Okay. And I know that Nick Pope has indicated . . . or no, excuse me, Mr. Frescona, your attorney has indicated that the very first siding was with Sergeant Stephens and yourself.
→ {"text": "好的。我知道尼克·波普曾提到⋯⋯或不，抱歉，弗雷斯科納先生，你的律師曾提到最初的目擊是史蒂芬斯軍士和你。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Nick Pope 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「尼克·波普」；Mr. Frescona 依照 terminology.yaml 為 Patrick Frescona（派翠克·弗雷斯科納）；Sergeant Stephens 依照 terminology.yaml 為 Staff Sergeant Bud Steffens（巴德·史蒂芬斯技術軍士）"}

220. Yes, sir. Sergeant Stephens and I were on routine law enforcement patrol. We were down checking East Gate and we observed what was going on in the force.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。史蒂芬斯軍士和我正在進行例行執法巡邏。我們在東門檢查時，觀察到森林中發生的狀況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "forest 被轉錄為 force，根據上下文應為 forest"}

221. Okay. And Sergeant Stephens went to Sergeant Penniston. Am I right on that?
→ {"text": "好的。史蒂芬斯軍士去找潘尼斯頓軍士。我這樣說對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Sergeant Penniston 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為 James Penniston（詹姆斯·潘尼斯頓）"}

222. Well, what happened was after we called it in, because he was a senior ranking individual, and Sergeant Penniston responded down to the gate, Sergeant Stephens briefed Sergeant Penniston on what was going on.
→ {"text": "嗯，事情是這樣的，我們回報之後，因為他是資深階級人員，潘尼斯頓軍士趕到門口，史蒂芬斯軍士向潘尼斯頓軍士簡報發生的狀況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. Oh, I see. Okay. And you went back . . . after Sergeant Penniston wanted to investigate after what he had heard, you accompanied him?
→ {"text": "哦，我明白了。好的。然後你回去⋯⋯潘尼斯頓軍士聽了之後想去調查，你陪同他一起？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. Yes. A decision was made by the on-duty shift commander after consultation with the squadron squad commander that we would go out and investigate, and Sergeant Penniston formed a team.
→ {"text": "是的。值勤指揮官在與中隊長協商後做出決定，我們前往調查，潘尼斯頓軍士組成了一個小隊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "on-duty shift commander 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「值勤指揮官」"}

225. And what happened to Sergeant Stephens that night?
→ {"text": "那麼史蒂芬斯軍士那晚怎麼了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. Sergeant Stephens was visibly shaken by what he was seeing in the forest, and there was two reasons why he didn't go out there. Number one, if he would have went out there also, there would have been nobody . . .
→ {"text": "史蒂芬斯軍士明顯被他在森林中看到的景象嚇到了，他沒有前往現場有兩個原因。第一，如果他也去了那裡，就不會有人⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. Well, he needed somebody on patrol, right?
→ {"text": "嗯，他需要有人在巡邏，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. Yeah, not only on patrol, but somebody in charge, because he was a senior ranking security officer, and Sergeant Stephens was a senior ranking law enforcement. But also, he really didn't want anything to do with it. Whatever he saw, what he was observing shook him up enough that he wanted to stay back, and he did not want to go into the forest.
→ {"text": "是的，不僅是巡邏，還需要有人負責，因為他是資深階級的安全官員，而史蒂芬斯軍士是資深階級的執法人員。但同時，他真的不想涉入其中。無論他看到了什麼，他觀察到的景象嚇到他了，他想留在後方，不想進入森林。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. And is he still alive? Do you know . . .
→ {"text": "他還在世嗎？你知道⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. We've had trouble tracking down some individuals, but I do believe he is still currently alive.
→ {"text": "我們在追蹤某些人時遇到困難，但我相信他目前仍然在世。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. I'm particularly interested in this classified record system of the Veterans Affairs Administration, because I can tell you, our staff, during my tenure in the Congress, spent a great deal of time with the Veterans Affairs Administration, and I have never heard of a classified section within Veterans Affairs. Could you tell me, as much as you know, in that short period of time here, in about one minute . . .
→ {"text": "我對退伍軍人事務管理局的這個機密記錄系統特別感興趣，因為我可以告訴你，在我國會任期內，我們的幕僚與退伍軍人事務管理局打了許多交道，我從未聽說過退伍軍人事務管理局內有機密部門。你能告訴我，就你所知，在這短暫的時間裡，大約一分鐘⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Veterans Affairs Administration 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「退伍軍人事務管理局」"}

232. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. What is a classified record section, and how many classified records do you believe are in there after your experience in dealing with them?
→ {"text": "什麼是機密記錄部門，根據你與他們打交道的經驗，你認為裡面有多少機密記錄？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. Okay. What was summarized, not only in the letter from Senator Cowell's office, which says once your claim is being processed and is determined that needed records are classified, the request for those records can be made. What the staffer told me was that the VA has a section that they maintain records for certain operations, and didn't necessarily mean rentals from any type of military operations as classified, and it's up to the gaining command, Army, Air Force, or whatever, whether or not they will allow those records to be released to the VA so you can receive treatment. She said she came across this recently in the past two or three years when she was the same way, was being stymied on certain cases involving PTSD and Agent Orange, and that she made this available to us. Not only that, but the VA volunteered it again to her, saying that they would not even let her know if my records
→ {"text": "好的。凱爾參議員辦公室的信件中總結了這一點，信中說一旦你的申請被處理，並且確定所需記錄被列為機密，就可以提出這些記錄的申請。幕僚告訴我，退伍軍人事務部有一個部門，他們為某些行動保存記錄，這不一定意味著任何類型的軍事行動的記錄都被列為機密，而是由相關指揮單位——陸軍、空軍或其他單位——決定是否允許這些記錄釋出給退伍軍人事務部，以便你能接受治療。她說她在過去兩三年中最近遇到這種情況，她也同樣在涉及創傷後壓力症候群和橙劑的某些案件上受阻，她向我們提供了這些資訊。不僅如此，退伍軍人事務部還主動告訴她，他們甚至不會讓她知道我的記錄", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Senator Cowell 應為 Senator Kyl（凱爾參議員）；PTSD 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「創傷後壓力症候群」；Agent Orange 為「橙劑」"}

235. were classified or not until I filed a disability claim.
→ {"text": "是否被列為機密，直到我提出殘障申請。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. In this question, I have no way in excusing a classified records section, especially with regards to medical records. I can't understand that when, as you say very correctly, Sergeant Burroughs, you are the owner of those medical records under the law of the United States.
→ {"text": "在這個問題上，我無法為機密記錄部門找藉口，特別是涉及醫療記錄的部分。我無法理解，如你所說得非常正確，巴勒斯軍士，根據美國法律，你是這些醫療記錄的所有人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. Even military laws, I understand it, and I'm not an expert on that, but that's the way I understand it. But as you found out about classified records sections, it's not just for people that have said, I mean people that are in classified sections aren't just for members of the, the veterans that have maybe made statements, as you've made, about things you've seen that relate to an identified flying object. Am I correct?
→ {"text": "即使是軍事法律，我也是這樣理解的，我不是這方面的專家，但我是這樣理解的。但如你所發現的機密記錄部門，它不僅僅是為那些曾經說過⋯⋯我是說，機密部門中的記錄不僅僅是為那些退伍軍人⋯⋯那些可能像你一樣，對所見的與不明飛行物相關的事物發表過聲明的人。我說的對嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "這段話有些語句不完整，但盡量根據上下文翻譯；unidentified flying object 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「不明飛行物」"}


## Speaker Group 24

238. That is correct. Yes, that is correct, sir. She said she became aware of it because of her work through Senator, you know, with Senator Kyl for veterans and their assistance, and she specifically said it was for PTSD and Agent Orange that they came across this.
→ {"text": "是的，沒錯。是的，先生，沒錯。她說她是因為與凱爾參議員合作協助退伍軍人的工作而知道這件事的，她特別提到他們是在處理創傷後壓力症候群和橙劑案件時發現這個情況的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. And she also told me that very few members of Congress were aware of this.
→ {"text": "她還告訴我，很少有國會議員知道這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

240. I'd like to hear from Sergeant Penniston on this question. If those records were handed to you today, what do you think would be on those records? Again, these would be records from the period, what, '80, December of 1980 to say '82 or '83, or whenever you had those medical evaluations while you were in the Air Force.
→ {"text": "我想聽聽潘尼斯頓軍士對這個問題的看法。如果今天這些記錄交給你，你認為上面會有什麼？再強調一次，這些是那段期間的記錄，就是 80 年、1980 年 12 月到 82 或 83 年，或者你在空軍接受醫療評估的任何時候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

241. Yeah, there would be a paper trail of my increasing medical condition from the night of the incident, and it showed progressive issues, and that's what it would show. The opportunity that we would have this time is that we will actually say that we were exposed to radiation, and I think that would change how the doctors would look at that.
→ {"text": "是的，會有一條文件軌跡，顯示我從事件發生當晚開始惡化的健康狀況，它會顯示漸進式的問題，這就是它會顯示的內容。我們這次會有的機會是，我們將實際說明我們曾暴露於輻射中，我認為這會改變醫生看待這件事的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

242. You believe that the records would absolutely show that you've been exposed to the radiation?
→ {"text": "你相信這些記錄絕對會顯示你曾暴露於輻射中？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

243. Well, the conditions that were, that I explained to the doctors at the time, I think will verify that. But I think Colonel Hall has also done that by issuing that letter to the VA. Yeah, I think that's what.
→ {"text": "嗯，我當時向醫生解釋的那些狀況，我認為會證實這一點。但我認為霍爾特上校也透過向退伍軍人事務部發出那封信做到了這一點。是的，我認為就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Colonel Hall 應為 Colonel Halt（霍爾特上校），Whisper 轉錄錯誤"}


## Speaker Group 29

244. Anything else that might be on those medical records, would your heart condition that you talked about show up there?
→ {"text": "這些醫療記錄上還可能有什麼，你提到的心臟狀況會出現在上面嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

245. There would be showing treatment for vision problems, which were related to my heart, and he had no, he could not figure out why I was having the vision problems I have. This was a full-blown specialist down at Wilford Hall where they ended up sending me, and he did look at me at one point and say, "Were you ever exposed to radiation?"
→ {"text": "會有視力問題的治療記錄，這與我的心臟有關，他無法⋯⋯他無法弄清楚為什麼我會有這些視力問題。這是在威爾福德醫院的一位專科醫生，他們最後把我送到那裡，他確實曾經看著我說：「你曾經暴露於輻射中嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Wilford Hall 是美國空軍醫療中心"}


## Speaker Group 31

246. Yeah, and you had, you were a pretty young man, that's kind of unusual at that age, especially you passed your physical exams to get enlisted into the Air Force, I take it. That's a pretty young age to be having heart difficulties, but you do believe those records would show that. I take your answer was yes.
→ {"text": "是的，而且你當時⋯⋯你是一個相當年輕的人，在那個年紀這種情況相當不尋常，特別是你通過了體檢才得以入伍空軍，我想是這樣。在那麼年輕的年紀就出現心臟問題是很不尋常的，但你確實相信這些記錄會顯示出來。我認為你的答案是肯定的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

247. Yes, sir. The records was clearly established that I came in healthy, and shortly after the incident, I became ill.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。記錄清楚地證明我入伍時是健康的，而在事件發生後不久，我就生病了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

248. For either one of you, sergeants, what has been the CIA reaction to your FOIA requests?
→ {"text": "請問兩位軍士，CIA 對你們的資訊自由法申請有什麼反應？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "FOIA 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「資訊自由法」"}


## Speaker Group 34

249. Do you want to hear from us, or turn it over directly?
→ {"text": "你想聽我們說，還是直接交給律師？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

250. Well, maybe we ought to hear from a lawyer, if you know, or whoever can answer that the best.
→ {"text": "嗯，也許我們應該聽律師說，如果你知道的話，或者任何能最好回答這個問題的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

251. Well, to answer that question, frustrating is the first word that, and the one I've already used in regard to them.
→ {"text": "嗯，要回答這個問題，「令人沮喪」是第一個詞，也是我在提到他們時已經用過的詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

252. But what was their reaction? I understand yours.
→ {"text": "但他們的反應是什麼？我理解你的反應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

253. Theirs was the typical, what they term, the Glomar, from the Glomar Explorer, responds, which is they can neither confirm nor deny whether they know anything, basically.
→ {"text": "他們的反應是典型的，他們所謂的 Glomar 回應，來自於 Glomar Explorer，基本上就是他們既不能確認也不能否認他們是否知道任何事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Glomar Explorer 是 CIA 的船隻，「Glomar 回應」是法律術語，指政府機構既不確認也不否認持有相關資訊；topics.json 中指出 Whisper 誤轉為 Glomar Challenger，但此處正確為 Glomar Explorer"}


## Speaker Group 39

254. And is that, do they know something, the CIA? I mean-
→ {"text": "那麼，CIA 是否知道些什麼？我是說——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

255. Well, they won't confirm or deny that.
→ {"text": "嗯，他們不會確認或否認這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

256. Yeah, but I mean, I'm talking about your, and I'm only, I'm not talking about the incident, I'm talking about the medical records here.
→ {"text": "是的，但我是說，我只是⋯⋯我不是在談論事件，我是在談論醫療記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

257. Oh, well, no, the requests propounded to them included medical records, or any and all records, I really should say. So they don't tell you what they do or don't have in regards to anything. And whether they actually have something or not, who knows? I mean, but I have to believe, based also on the boots that were on the ground, that there were the people there.
→ {"text": "哦，嗯，不，向他們提出的申請包括醫療記錄，或者我真正應該說的是，任何和所有記錄。所以他們不會告訴你關於任何事情他們有什麼或沒有什麼。至於他們是否真的持有什麼，誰知道呢？我是說，但我必須相信，基於當時在現場的人員，確實有人在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

258. Okay, now, do either of the sergeants have any other feeling about the CIA, or not about the CIA?
→ {"text": "好的，現在，兩位軍士對 CIA 還有其他看法嗎，或不是關於 CIA 的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

259. About the State Department, we can bring up.
→ {"text": "關於美國國務院，我們可以提一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "State Department 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「美國國務院」"}


## Speaker Group 45

260. I'd love to hear what you think about the State Department's reaction. Again, not to the sightings or anything, but to the medical records.
→ {"text": "我很想聽聽你們對美國國務院反應的看法。再次強調，不是對目擊事件或其他事情，而是對醫療記錄的反應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

261. Okay. When the State Department was given a FOIA request, they admitted to having records on file.
→ {"text": "好的。當美國國務院收到資訊自由法申請時，他們承認持有檔案記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

262. The State Department has admitted?
→ {"text": "美國國務院承認了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

263. Yes, they did.
→ {"text": "是的，他們承認了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

264. Which would make it an-
→ {"text": "這將使它成為一起——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

265. The State Department and the CIA is-
→ {"text": "美國國務院和 CIA 是——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

266. Yes, but that would mean it was an international incident, because Department of State was involved in a foreign country. But what they did then was say that they belonged to United States Air Force, and it was up to the Air Force to decide whether or not they would be released. The United States Air Force claims there's no records on file.
→ {"text": "是的，但這意味著它是一起國際事件，因為國務院涉入了外國事務。但他們隨後說這些記錄屬於美國空軍，由空軍決定是否釋出。美國空軍聲稱檔案中沒有記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

267. Okay. And besides the two Arizona senators that have been talked about, McCain and Kyle, I'd like to ask you about Senator James Exon, who was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I understand he said that he had spent more time looking into this particular incident than any other case in his quote. I think I've got this right. Since I've been a U.S. Senator, while he's said that additional information like a seven interagency memorandum is on file, he says that he feels there's been no cover-up. Now, why did he say that?
→ {"text": "好的。除了已經提到的兩位亞利桑那州參議員，馬侃和凱爾，我想問你關於詹姆斯·埃克森參議員的事，他是參議院軍事委員會成員。我了解他說他花在調查這起特定事件的時間比他引述中的任何其他案件都多。我想我沒記錯。自從他成為美國參議員以來，雖然他說像七個跨部門備忘錄之類的額外資訊有存檔，但他說他認為沒有真相掩蓋。那麼，他為什麼這麼說？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Senator McCain 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「馬侃參議員」；Senator Kyl（Kyle 是拼寫錯誤）翻譯為「凱爾參議員」；Senator James Exon 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「詹姆斯·埃克森參議員」"}

268. In your opinions, or the opinion of the attorney, or anybody else that-
→ {"text": "根據你們的意見，或律師的意見，或其他任何人——", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

269. Well, in my opinion, the Air Force, after the incident broke, the memo was released, they contacted us and wanted us to have brief contact with the press admitting what happened.
→ {"text": "嗯，依我之見，空軍在事件曝光後，備忘錄被公開，他們聯繫我們，希望我們與媒體簡短接觸，承認發生了什麼事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. There was something that happened out there, but they didn't want us to go into detail.
→ {"text": "那裡確實發生了一些事情，但他們不希望我們詳細說明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. Well, I appreciate that, Chair. It seems to me, and I think, and I hope I'm a fair-minded person, but I'd like to say any other fair-minded person, that if they've admitted that an incident has taken place, we don't have to get them to admit maybe your interpretation of what you saw, or what you, they don't have to admit what you saw. But they sure have to admit that there's no reason to hold your medical records, and this is very disturbing to me, because the only, what could possibly be a reason to withhold from the person whose medical record it is, a medical record, if they've confirmed the incident, which they have. Would you, that's why I'm not necessarily agreeing with Senator Exxon here, and saying, I don't see how this can be unless a cover-up has taken place. And I don't mean to be throwing uninformed statements out here, but you cannot admit that there was an incident. I'd just

If you irradiate food to preserve it, if you then take the food away from the radiation source, there is no radiation coming from the food. If there was radiation found at that site the next day or so, something was left there from which the radiation was coming. Radiation is like light beams. It's gone when you pull the source away. The radiation is gone. What was left there?

Colonel Holt investigated the landing site from the first night shortly before he had his own encounter, and the disaster preparedness officer, Sergeant Monroe Nevels, noticed that not only were there indentations in the ground where this thing had apparently landed, three indentations forming essentially a triangular shape, but the inside, this was in a clearing, the insides of the trees seemed to him to have been scorched and burned somewhat. Again, the document, the February 23rd Ministry of Defense document that you have is from the scientific and technical intelligence part of the defense intelligence staff. I'm not a scientist myself, so I can't speak to the technicalities of it, but clearly a number of people who looked at the landing site after Jim and John's account certainly got close to all this.
