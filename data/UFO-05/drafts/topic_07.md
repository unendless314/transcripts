## Speaker Group 23

193. Can I bring up a point, ma'am?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. Yes, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. All right. You told us to be aggressive. Where was our chain of command when it came for them to be aggressive? After the incident happened, we were brought in and interrogated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. They did nothing to stop that. They did nothing to step up and make sure that we were treated medically after the incident. OK, the chain of command is clearly partly, or at least partly, being prohibited and what they need to do because this incident has been classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. And not only has it been classified, it's been classified and kept away from the people that serve this country, which is the Senate and House of Representatives, the United States of America. And we're trying to do what we're trying to do, but at the same time, where are we going to go when people like Senator Kyl are prohibited from receiving records?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. Yeah. I was going to say . . .
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. He . . .
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. Go to a House member.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. Yeah. You have to . . . I tell this to . . . when I was in Congress, I told this to every person that came in that wanted anything or wanted any help.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. Excuse me. I yield the Congress home additional two minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. All right. You also have to be very persistent with that member that you're dealing with, whether it's a Senator or a House member. You have to be persistent and say, "What have you found out? Is anything happening?" And talk to . . . I mean, if they've . . . most members have really great staff, talk to the staff and you just have to be just pound on them that you need to have this information. But I so appreciate you telling us this story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. It's . . . I am embarrassed for our military that they don't come forward with the information so that you can get the kind of treatment that you need. So thank you, first of all, for serving. Again, I hope that there will be people that will step forward. You have to be consistent, be persistent, and hopefully you'll get the information you need. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. Thank you, Congresswoman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. I yield back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. Thank you, Congresswoman. Congressman Cook?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. Yes. You know, I want to say that for any open-minded Americans out there, no matter how skeptical, this is very interesting stuff we're hearing today. Extremely interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. And I'm surprised that not more Americans know about this Rendlesham Forest incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. I'd like to ask . . . and I want to commend both sergeants for their service to our country and apologize for the United States government, even though I'm not in any official capacity at the moment for withholding important information. But let me start, Sergeant Burroughs, by asking you, you enlisted in the Air Force when you were . . . or in the year 1979, I think you said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. Yes, sir, 1979.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. Okay. And how old were you at the time?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. I would have been 18 years old.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. Okay. And how old were you when you were made sergeant in the United States Air Force?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. I believe I was . . . I was 22 or 23 when I received my E-Force status. I can't remember exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. Okay. So that would have been about 1982, '83? '82 or '83, if I'm correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. Okay. After the Rendlesham Forest incident?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. Okay. And I know that Nick Pope has indicated . . . or no, excuse me, Mr. Frescona, your attorney has indicated that the very first siding was with Sergeant Stephens and yourself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. Yes, sir. Sergeant Stephens and I were on routine law enforcement patrol. We were down checking East Gate and we observed what was going on in the force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. Okay. And Sergeant Stephens went to Sergeant Penniston. Am I right on that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. Well, what happened was after we called it in, because he was a senior ranking individual, and Sergeant Penniston responded down to the gate, Sergeant Stephens briefed Sergeant Penniston on what was going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. Oh, I see. Okay. And you went back . . . after Sergeant Penniston wanted to investigate after what he had heard, you accompanied him?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. Yes. A decision was made by the on-duty shift commander after consultation with the squadron squad commander that we would go out and investigate, and Sergeant Penniston formed a team.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. And what happened to Sergeant Stephens that night?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. Sergeant Stephens was visibly shaken by what he was seeing in the forest, and there was two reasons why he didn't go out there. Number one, if he would have went out there also, there would have been nobody . . .
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. Well, he needed somebody on patrol, right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. Yeah, not only on patrol, but somebody in charge, because he was a senior ranking security officer, and Sergeant Stephens was a senior ranking law enforcement. But also, he really didn't want anything to do with it. Whatever he saw, what he was observing shook him up enough that he wanted to stay back, and he did not want to go into the forest.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. And is he still alive? Do you know . . .
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. We've had trouble tracking down some individuals, but I do believe he is still currently alive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. I'm particularly interested in this classified record system of the Veterans Affairs Administration, because I can tell you, our staff, during my tenure in the Congress, spent a great deal of time with the Veterans Affairs Administration, and I have never heard of a classified section within Veterans Affairs. Could you tell me, as much as you know, in that short period of time here, in about one minute . . .
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. What is a classified record section, and how many classified records do you believe are in there after your experience in dealing with them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. Okay. What was summarized, not only in the letter from Senator Cowell's office, which says once your claim is being processed and is determined that needed records are classified, the request for those records can be made. What the staffer told me was that the VA has a section that they maintain records for certain operations, and didn't necessarily mean rentals from any type of military operations as classified, and it's up to the gaining command, Army, Air Force, or whatever, whether or not they will allow those records to be released to the VA so you can receive treatment. She said she came across this recently in the past two or three years when she was the same way, was being stymied on certain cases involving PTSD and Agent Orange, and that she made this available to us. Not only that, but the VA volunteered it again to her, saying that they would not even let her know if my records
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. were classified or not until I filed a disability claim.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. In this question, I have no way in excusing a classified records section, especially with regards to medical records. I can't understand that when, as you say very correctly, Sergeant Burroughs, you are the owner of those medical records under the law of the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. Even military laws, I understand it, and I'm not an expert on that, but that's the way I understand it. But as you found out about classified records sections, it's not just for people that have said, I mean people that are in classified sections aren't just for members of the, the veterans that have maybe made statements, as you've made, about things you've seen that relate to an identified flying object. Am I correct?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

238. That is correct. Yes, that is correct, sir. She said she became aware of it because of her work through Senator, you know, with Senator Kyl for veterans and their assistance, and she specifically said it was for PTSD and Agent Orange that they came across this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. And she also told me that very few members of Congress were aware of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

240. I'd like to hear from Sergeant Penniston on this question. If those records were handed to you today, what do you think would be on those records? Again, these would be records from the period, what, '80, December of 1980 to say '82 or '83, or whenever you had those medical evaluations while you were in the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

241. Yeah, there would be a paper trail of my increasing medical condition from the night of the incident, and it showed progressive issues, and that's what it would show. The opportunity that we would have this time is that we will actually say that we were exposed to radiation, and I think that would change how the doctors would look at that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

242. You believe that the records would absolutely show that you've been exposed to the radiation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

243. Well, the conditions that were, that I explained to the doctors at the time, I think will verify that. But I think Colonel Hall has also done that by issuing that letter to the VA. Yeah, I think that's what.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

244. Anything else that might be on those medical records, would your heart condition that you talked about show up there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

245. There would be showing treatment for vision problems, which were related to my heart, and he had no, he could not figure out why I was having the vision problems I have. This was a full-blown specialist down at Wilford Hall where they ended up sending me, and he did look at me at one point and say, "Were you ever exposed to radiation?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

246. Yeah, and you had, you were a pretty young man, that's kind of unusual at that age, especially you passed your physical exams to get enlisted into the Air Force, I take it. That's a pretty young age to be having heart difficulties, but you do believe those records would show that. I take your answer was yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

247. Yes, sir. The records was clearly established that I came in healthy, and shortly after the incident, I became ill.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

248. For either one of you, sergeants, what has been the CIA reaction to your FOIA requests?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

249. Do you want to hear from us, or turn it over directly?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

250. Well, maybe we ought to hear from a lawyer, if you know, or whoever can answer that the best.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 36

251. Well, to answer that question, frustrating is the first word that, and the one I've already used in regard to them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

252. But what was their reaction? I understand yours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

253. Theirs was the typical, what they term, the Glomar, from the Glomar Explorer, responds, which is they can neither confirm nor deny whether they know anything, basically.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 39

254. And is that, do they know something, the CIA? I mean-
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 40

255. Well, they won't confirm or deny that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 41

256. Yeah, but I mean, I'm talking about your, and I'm only, I'm not talking about the incident, I'm talking about the medical records here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 42

257. Oh, well, no, the requests propounded to them included medical records, or any and all records, I really should say. So they don't tell you what they do or don't have in regards to anything. And whether they actually have something or not, who knows? I mean, but I have to believe, based also on the boots that were on the ground, that there were the people there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 43

258. Okay, now, do either of the sergeants have any other feeling about the CIA, or not about the CIA?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 44

259. About the State Department, we can bring up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 45

260. I'd love to hear what you think about the State Department's reaction. Again, not to the sightings or anything, but to the medical records.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 46

261. Okay. When the State Department was given a FOIA request, they admitted to having records on file.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 47

262. The State Department has admitted?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

263. Yes, they did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 49

264. Which would make it an-
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 50

265. The State Department and the CIA is-
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 51

266. Yes, but that would mean it was an international incident, because Department of State was involved in a foreign country. But what they did then was say that they belonged to United States Air Force, and it was up to the Air Force to decide whether or not they would be released. The United States Air Force claims there's no records on file.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 52

267. Okay. And besides the two Arizona senators that have been talked about, McCain and Kyle, I'd like to ask you about Senator James Exon, who was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I understand he said that he had spent more time looking into this particular incident than any other case in his quote. I think I've got this right. Since I've been a U.S. Senator, while he's said that additional information like a seven interagency memorandum is on file, he says that he feels there's been no cover-up. Now, why did he say that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. In your opinions, or the opinion of the attorney, or anybody else that-
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 53

269. Well, in my opinion, the Air Force, after the incident broke, the memo was released, they contacted us and wanted us to have brief contact with the press admitting what happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. There was something that happened out there, but they didn't want us to go into detail.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. And with the MOD saying no defense significance, and the Air Force saying there's no cover-up, what they're basically saying is an incident took place, and we're not lying that it took place. But what we're not available and willing to do is go into what's been classified and what the final outcome was. >> Well, I'd have to say that if they admit that an incident's taken place without identifying what that incident-
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 54

272. Excuse me, Congressman. Let me yield you an additional two minutes on the record, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 55

273. Well, I appreciate that, Chair. It seems to me, and I think, and I hope I'm a fair-minded person, but I'd like to say any other fair-minded person, that if they've admitted that an incident has taken place, we don't have to get them to admit maybe your interpretation of what you saw, or what you, they don't have to admit what you saw. But they sure have to admit that there's no reason to hold your medical records, and this is very disturbing to me, because the only, what could possibly be a reason to withhold from the person whose medical record it is, a medical record, if they've confirmed the incident, which they have. Would you, that's why I'm not necessarily agreeing with Senator Exxon here, and saying, I don't see how this can be unless a cover-up has taken place. And I don't mean to be throwing uninformed statements out here, but you cannot admit that there was an incident. I'd just
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. like to clarify this point once more, because I want to be careful the way I'm saying it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. And then insist on classifying a medical record related to that incident, and it doesn't matter what the incident absolutely is or was, and we don't even have to talk about whether it was a UFO, whether it was, as you say, Sergeant Penniston, you're not totally a believer in ET, but you believe that you saw definitely an unidentified maneuvering object. Well, that is solid evidence then. And I'm not saying exactly what you saw is right now, but I'm saying that is evidence that's indisputed as far as being a cover-up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. Excuse me. Thank you. Eel back, Congressman. Thank you. I have a request from one of our members who would like a second shot at this, and we'd like to give him the time allotted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. Congressman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. Thank you very much. I have some questions about the radiation. I understand that the next day or so they went in and found radiation. If you irradiate food to preserve it, if you then take the food away from the radiation source, there is no radiation coming from the food. If there was radiation found at that site the next day or so, something was left there from which the radiation was coming. Radiation is like light beams. It's gone when you pull the source away. The radiation is gone. What was left there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. Nick, go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. Yes. Colonel Holt investigated the landing site from the first night shortly before he had his own encounter, and the disaster preparedness officer, Sergeant Monroe Nevels, noticed that not only were there indentations in the ground where this thing had apparently landed, three indentations forming essentially a triangular shape, but the inside, this was in a clearing, the insides of the trees seemed to him to have been scorched and burned somewhat. Again, the document, the February 23rd Ministry of Defense document that you have is from the scientific and technical intelligence part of the defense intelligence staff. I'm not a scientist myself, so I can't speak to the technicalities of it, but clearly a number of people who looked at the landing site after Jim and John's account certainly got close to all this. This is again one of the reasons why this is of some concern. A number of these
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. people have gone on the record, but a number have not and may not even be aware that there are potential health care issues arising from the radiation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. But am I not correct that if radiation was coming from the site, something was left there from which the radiation was coming? Radiation is like a light beam. If you take the source away, the source of light away, there isn't any light. Take the source of radiation away, there isn't any radiation unless you leave something there that is irradiating. What was left there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. I don't know, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. Okay. I'd be very curious what was left there that was radiating. You said that the trees were scorched, but when it took off, there was no heat. There was no backwash. And why would there be indentations in the soil? Because you saw it hovering. It wasn't even touching the soil.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. That's the way it appeared, sir. It would be hovering. But the only thing it was emulating on it was light, and not unless the light caused indentions. I don't know. It's beyond my -- I can guess on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. One last question. Sometimes we have things so difficult to deal with that we don't deal with them. They're locked away in our mind, and they're accessible only through hypnosis.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. You said that when you came out of the hypnotic state, that the hypnotist seemed somewhat -- Distressed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. Distressed, whatever word.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. Yes, she was. She was distressed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. Did she write a report that is available? What did you tell her under hypnosis that made her respond that way?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. Well, I went into the incident. The problem that she was having in what created a second hypnosis was when I got to the landing site, I would jump to OSI. I'd be in the OSI room.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. And she says -- she's read about this. She says, "But I'm not sure." And she says, "What I'm thinking it is," she says, "I think your memory's been blocked." And she says, "Now, why would they do that?" And I says, "I don't know."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. Both of you fell down when there was a light from this. Does that understand that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. Do you have any idea how long you were on the ground before you got up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. Seconds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. But that's what you -- when I go under anesthetic, I -- five hours, and it doesn't seem like I have any time as a lapse. How do you know it was seconds?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. Well, there is a time distortion. I mean, that -- you can get with adrenaline and things like that. It can -- you know, more time can go by than actually that you realize. I understand that. The craft was on the ground of 45 minutes. I mean, it's not like it was -- the reason we know exactly the minutes on that, by the way, is after we got back in, our watches were all 45 minutes off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. Oh, gosh.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. Your watches were 45 minutes off, so maybe you were unconscious for 45 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. I wasn't unconscious. I mean, I -- But, sir, if you become unconscious and become conscious again, you may have no sense of that. I can put a hood over your head, and you will breathe nitrogen, and you will become unconscious. And if I then give you oxygen, you will be conscious, and you will have no knowledge that you were unconscious. To your knowledge, you were not unconscious. That doesn't mean that you weren't unconscious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. Well, every time I've been given anesthetic, I know I was under anesthetic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. There's some little trauma going under anesthesia, but in this case, there wasn't any.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. One interesting note was the shift commander confirmed they lost radio contact with us for over 45 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. Okay. But I'm very curious what that 45 minutes was. Maybe you were unconscious for 45 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. I have no idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. It's possible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. You're very welcome. We're nearing our break, but I am going to allow Senator Gravel to have two minutes to comment to you, and then we'll have a break.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. You made a statement that there was another military personnel, female personnel who drove up and her car or her vehicle was shut off, not by her, and how did she get out? And did she suffer any disabilities as a result of this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. Two things that stand out with that. Now, at one point, her vehicle was shut down. She was relieved of duty, and in fact, she should have been the on-duty shift commander on the night of Colonel Hall's incident. She wasn't present. At our level, we would not have been briefed on what treatment she received or what the final outcome was, but not only was her vehicle shut down, but on the third night, the light-offs and radios were malfunctioning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. They couldn't even get the lights to come on out in the fields, which clearly points towards there was some kind of electrical interference.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. And this has been reported. Mr. Pope, is this part of the record that there was a general shutdown of electrical service or energy service during this period of time?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. I can't recall, sir, whether the documents say that, but Colonel Holt and a number of the other people, but particularly Holt, because he was the deputy base commander, has gone on the record and confirmed that. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. Good. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. You're very welcome. We now come to a 15-minute break time. Our witnesses will rejoin us, and I'm getting another note.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. Yes, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. Okay. Is that the congressman?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. I apologize.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. That's okay. Just for a moment, Congressman Cook has asked for an additional minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. Well, even just 30 seconds. I meant to ask you this earlier, Sergeant Burroughs. You indicated you were promoted to sergeant after this incident occurred. Can you give us some indication of maybe the year or two after the incident occurred, any thing you said? Clearly they weren't denying you of being a member of the Air Force at that time, so I'm trying to just understand did you kind of, well, were you being politically correct for a year or two, and then what I'm trying to understand is the time scale on when they started saying that you weren't even a member of the Air Force. Do you understand?

323. Yes, sir. That just came up on our inquiries that are going on now that when I did get a little bit of my records released, there was no DD form 214 in there, and also the fact that the doctor that was interviewing me that day said there was no record. Now, that doesn't mean that technically the Air Force is saying that I wasn't in. What they're trying to do is show that whatever part of the incident took place is classified in my records or in those files, and one other interesting note I want to bring up to you, a few years after the incident, I went down to Maxwell Air Force Base, and I went into the, you know how they keep the history of the wings in the base. I went in and requested the history of the wing, the 81st Tech Fighter Wing in 1980. When they gave me the files, December of 1980 was missing. It was pulled and was classified.

325. We've got a couple announcements from Mr. Bookman before we go on recess, and we will be back in 15 minutes, and the same witnesses will see you at that time.
