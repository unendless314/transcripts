67. No, ma'am. >> You're fine. Thank you, Congressman. Congresswoman Hooley, please. >> All right. Thank you very much. Thank you all for being on this panel. And Sergeant Penniston and Sergeant Burroughs, thank you for hanging in here. This has been a lot of years you've carried this around with you.

68. What are you doing now? Not in this minute, in life.

## Speaker Group 13

69. Okay. I got that. No, we're in the process of making this a historical document. We're writing a book, the three of us together to put this out. And I recently, you know, was a human resource director for a county government for 20 years. Actually, I've been on the service and retired now for 20 years this year, so. >> And in your record -- well, Sergeant Burroughs, what are you doing now? >> Yes, ma'am. I retired from the Air Force in 2006. And I took a couple civilian jobs and also was a basketball coach. But because of my current medical conditions, I'm basically limited in what I can do and I'm trying to work on getting disability. >> So your current medical situations, both of you. So are you getting treated by the Veterans Administration for this -- your illnesses?

## Speaker Group 14

70. Barely. Okay. They have addressed a few issues, like with the interior problems of disbalance issues. See, one of the problems was is initially -- we were supposed to treat it as top secret, which we did. I followed orders. Then when I did that, I had to go to the base of the hospital because I was having problems walking. I mean, it was like within three weeks after the incident. So here I am with a dilemma. Do I violate orders and tell them -- because they asked me and they said, have you been exposed to radiation recently? So I followed orders and said no. I mean, it was obvious that that was radioactive out there because it was so warm to touch. >> So you did touch it. That was going to be -- >> Yeah, that's probably the worst decision I made, I think, touching that. Yeah. I didn't -- after the initial contact with it and the

71. explosion of light, I didn't touch it again, though. I just walked around it and tried to write down as many notes as I could. Getting back to the medical issues, I got out in 1993, and early 1994, I went to -- I was just having a terrible time sleeping. I mean, I was getting maybe two to three hours a night of sleep, and so I decided to -- I went to my doctor and she said, well, maybe I'll send you to a psychiatrist. It could be some PTSD. I didn't call it that then, but -- and I said, okay, we'll try that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

72. And this is a VA doctor? >> No, I had to pay for that myself. They went -- the VA said I didn't have a medal for combat in England, so I know that makes no sense. I said I had an incident -- I told them all about that. I had an incident. I said I can't -- it was classified and I can't tell you what it is, but it's fair -- viable with the government, not necessarily the Air Force. But anyway, they wouldn't -- I went to my own doctor, my own MD, and she referred to me to a -- I told her I wanted a reasonable price -- a psychiatrist. I mean, that's impossible. I want you to know that. There's no reasonable pricing on that. So I go there, and, you know, after a couple of visits, she says, you know what I'd like to do? Because I think she was thinking like, oh, maybe you're abused when you're a child or something like that. I don't know. Who
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. knows? And she said, I'd like to do some hypnosis with you and, you know, regressional hypnosis and we'll try that. She says I'm going to tape it because that's what I use for notes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. And I said, okay. And so -- and she says you won't remember nothing. I'll make sure that you don't remember anything from it. And she said we'll get you to sleep in the morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. I said great. And then I come out of the hypnosis. It was like two hours. And she's like -- she looked like I don't -- her mouth is down at the bottom of the table. And she says, tell me about RF Woodbridge. And I said, wow. And I said, I think it's classified. I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. And she says, well, she said, you know, and I remembered when I got out, that was a specific question I asked about it being classified. And they come back with some weird answer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. The Pentagon, the information office said that nothing classified happened at Bentwater, so therefore nothing is classified for you to worry about, which is so ridiculous of an answer from the Pentagon. I mean, what they should have said is the incident is classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. And then that means I can't talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

79. But that doesn't -- that wouldn't mean you couldn't be treated because you can talk in generalities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

80. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

81. Yes, I have been exposed to radiation. So I did have another question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

82. Did you want me to answer?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

83. Yeah, I want you -- yes, please, Mr. Burrows.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

84. So for me, shortly after the incident happened, I started not feeling well. At one point, my gums turned white. A couple, three months later, while home on leave, I became very ill and went into the emergency room. Okay. The doctor there listened to my chest and came back and says, well, what does the Air Force say about heart murmurs? And I looked at him and I says, I don't have a heart murmur. I just shortly joined the Air Force and my physical said I had a clean bill of health. And one of the other interesting things to know about a heart murmur is you're not allowed to enter the United States Air Force if you have a heart murmur.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

85. Of course not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

86. It's against regulations. So at that point, I wasn't sure how or why I got it. And the other question was, later on when I had vision problems was from the doctor down at Wilford Hall was have you ever been exposed to radiation? Again, I did not relate back at that point to the time in the fields at Rendlesham Forest. Three years ago, I got really sick one day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. I went into the urgent care thinking I had bronchitis. They put me on an EKG machine and they rushed me to the hospital. I was an AFib, congestive heart failure. At that point, they did a bunch of tests in the hospital. They shocked my heart back into regular rhythm, but none of the tests were conclusive on why I would have AFib or congestive heart failure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. I was released, followed up with my civilian doctor, and eventually the insurance company blocked any more tests because there was nothing showing why I could have any of those incidents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. I was a nonsmoker as far as cigarettes. I didn't drink alcohol. Everything was clearing my arteries and everything else and my doctor was perplexed. My heart did rebound and I went back to normal life. Eight months later, I walked into the emergency room and my heart rate, my ejection fraction rate was down to ten percent. I was the walking dead. They transferred me immediately down to a heart hospital in Phoenix, Arizona.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. So you're not, but you're not being treated by the VA?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. No, I'll get to that in a minute. I'll get to that, how it's all about. Because of all this, Mr. Frisco and I started inquiring with the government, the VA and everybody else about, because my doctor's requesting my medical records from the military, about my records. Senator Kyle, who I sent a letter to in December or January of 2010, took my case. He started looking into it, okay? During the process of his investigation, we received a letter, which we have here today, and a phone call from his, from one of his senior staffers saying it appears to be that my records are located in a classified VA section, which the staffer told me, which is not well known to anybody, to include members of Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. She said we came across this when we were doing an investigation on PTSD and Agent Orange and we kept running into things that we couldn't get past, and we discovered this classified section, okay? My initial request for my VA records were denied. The VA said that because I had not filed for disability, they would not even release my medical records, which belonged to me. They would not release my records to my doctor so I could receive treatment, because I had not filed for disability and allowed the VA to review it. Senator Kyle had me go in, file a disability claim, and bring him that claim. This was in June of 2010. In November of 2010, after not hearing from him, we sent him a letter. His response back to us was I was unable to obtain your records. My suggestion is, because I'm retiring, is to try to contact Senator McCain and see what he can do for you. Now, I've gone almost
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. a year without getting any reaction or any kind of care from the Veterans Administration because my records are classified. Finally, after a few months, Senator McCain was able to move up my claim and I was seen by the VA in Prescott, Arizona. When I met with the doctor who was reviewing my case, we started discussing my case. She looks at me and she says, because I keep referring back to 79, 80, and 81. She looks at me directly in the face and says, sir, I have no DD form 214 for you from 1979 to 82. It does not show you being in the United States Air Force. And supplicantly, I have no records, no medical records of you during that time frame. I looked at her and I said, oh, what a surprise. That means they're classified. She looked back at me in shock and said, there's some things we don't have a need to know. There's people above us that handle this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. Thank you. What I was going to say that, and I would like to ask Mr. Pope a question, but what I was going to say was, have you gone through your congressional offices? Because I know in my district, we would have turned that into a major case and demanded, you can't tell them what the outcome has to be, but you can demand information all the way down to why, you know. What was interesting about both. And asking for a waiver. What was very interesting about Senator Kyle and Senator McCain is they would not comment on anything other than they would attempt to get the VA to treat us. That was it. Right. But McCain got you that far.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. Well, I'm currently now, I was, yes, interviewed by the VA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. Okay. And Mr. Penness. I'm not having too good of a success with Senator Kirk. Well, push. I mean, you really have to because -- Excuse me. I yield to Kyle some additional two minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. Oh, thank you. Because they are your advocates to, I mean, it's our responsibility to be the interference between, and the conduit between our constituents and federal agencies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. And the idea that you were in the Air Force and they say you weren't, I mean, this is not okay. And these, your members of Congress and senators have to go front for you on this. We're doing this alone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. I know. But -- We're not getting the help that we need with it. I mean, when Pat, our attorney, I mean, we're retired Air Force. There's no doubt about that, I mean.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. But he tried to get my records. And the only records they're going to provide him is from the time I got out. Yeah, I know. But what I'm hearing is that those boroughs and probably yourself, Jim, that they are denying you were even in the Air Force the first -- when you were in -- I mean, that is -- come on, that's criminal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. This is the United States of America. So something has to be fixed with that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. I have to ask Nick Pope a question, okay? I want to know why, when the incident happened in Great Britain and it wasn't even on the American base, why did the Americans become the lead in the investigation? This was in Great Britain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. My assessment of that is that because the incident was regarded as a security incident, the Americans did have the jurisdiction to go off base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. It's -- the umbrella piece of legislation, as I understand it, is the NATO status of forces agreement. And jurisdiction can actually be concurrent in a security situation. The U.S. do have the authority to go outside the wire. But the U.K. have jurisdiction, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. But the U.S. took primacy because it was a security event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. Okay. Thank you. Let me just make a statement here. I've been advised by our congressional research service gentleman on the end there that because you were so obedient and had such short opening statements, we do have a little leeway time here. So I'm going to yield the congresswoman two more minutes for the attorney here. Thank you. Mr. Fresco, go on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. I just wanted to add that I'm not helping these gentlemen for my career sake, okay?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. I'm doing it because they're worthy of an effort being put forth on their behalf.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. And as I had said in the opening statement, their case is so compelling.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. There's just no way I could leave it without trying to do something for it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. I wanted to say, though, I worked for a member of the California delegation in the 1980s, a legislative assistant there, too. And one of my issue areas was Bureau of Land Management. The oddest thing we came across in that office at the time were nude sunbathers in the deserts of California that I would have to deal with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. Shame, shame. Well, it goes to the next point I want to make, which all I would do is call the liaison with BLM and have them send a call out there and move them on. But it's interesting to watch the reaction whenever I approach, particularly in this case with John, Senator Kyle's office.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. Everybody gets to a point, for lack of a better word, weird at some point when you bring up the Rendlesham case. Everybody gets weird at some point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. And although I understand the senator was retiring, he had had almost a year, or rather his -- some L.A. in his office did. If that had been me, Congressman Thomas would have fired me if after a year I had not resolved a constituents problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. So nothing against Senator Kyle or his staff. But it goes to show how there is a wall at some point you reach in this case. And thus, we're at the point that we are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. And searching for answers. Well, I'm hoping that others of my colleagues up here are going to continue this conversation, because they've told me I've outwarned my welcome for a moment. Very good, very good line of questioning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. Thank you, Congresswoman. Senator Gravel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
