26. I am legal counsel to James Penniston and John Burroughs, both of whom proudly and passionately served our country in the United States Air Force. Mr. Burroughs and Mr. Penniston are seated with me this morning along with Nick Pope, formerly with the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense. Mr. Pope has been a long-time advocate for full disclosure of the events for which we will discuss today. For me, it is indeed nothing short of an honor to be seated beside these gentlemen. Thirty-three years ago at the zenith of the Cold War in 1980, Staff Sergeant James Penniston and Airman First Class John Burroughs were assigned to the twin Royal Air Force bases of Bentwaters and Woodbridge near Suffolk, England. At that time, RAF Bentwaters and Woodbridge were leased by the United Kingdom to the U.S. Air Force.
→ {"text": "我是詹姆斯·潘尼斯頓和約翰·巴勒斯的法律顧問，兩位都曾自豪且熱誠地在美國空軍為國服務。巴勒斯先生和潘尼斯頓先生今天早上與我一同在座，還有英國國防部的前官員尼克·波普先生。波普先生長期以來一直倡導全面揭露我們今天將討論的事件真相。對我而言，能與這些先生們並肩而坐確實是無上的榮幸。三十三年前，在1980年冷戰高峰時期，技術軍士詹姆斯·潘尼斯頓和一等兵約翰·巴勒斯被分派至英國薩福克郡附近的 RAF Bentwaters 和 RAF Woodbridge 雙基地。當時，RAF Bentwaters 和 RAF Woodbridge 由英國租借給美國空軍使用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. Together, the twin bases were home to the largest tactical fighter wing in existence anywhere in the world at that time. James Penniston held U.S. as well as NATO security clearances and was responsible for the protection of sophisticated war-making assets in addition to the personnel located at the bases. By December of 1980, he was the senior security officer in charge of base security at the twin base facility. After midnight on December 26, 1980, Airman Burroughs along with Staff Sergeant Bud Steffens were on patrol. Together, when they noticed strange lights emanating from just outside the east gate of the Bentwaters base in the adjacent Rendlesham Forest. Mr. Burroughs had been stationed at the twin base facility for nearly two years and had never seen such an unusual phenomenon previously in the forest. Sergeant Steffens and Airman Burroughs telephoned Central Security Control,

28. Tennessee from the kiosk at the east gate to report the unidentified lights just beyond the bases perimeter. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Penniston was briefed by Staff Sergeant Steffens regarding the strange lights that they had seen. Mr. Penniston was further informed that the lights did not result from a crash but had landed in the forest. This is a remark he discounted by Sergeant Steffens and proceeded to notify the base control center that there was instead a possible downed aircraft. Mr. Penniston also learned that an object had been seen on radar over Rendlesham Forest. Moreover, a call came over his radio that eastern radar had also confirmed an object that disappeared from their screens over the forest. The team Mr. Penniston assembled to investigate the lights in the forest consisted of himself, Airman Burroughs, and Airman Ed Kabancik. As he and the rest of the team approached

30. Penniston instructed Airman Kabancik to remain at the edge of the forest to act as a relay for transmissions between he and Mr. Burroughs as they entered the forest themselves. As these two gentlemen proceeded into the forest, they were expecting to find a downed aircraft.
→ {"text": "指示卡班希克一等兵留在森林邊緣，作為他與巴勒斯先生之間的無線電中繼站，當他們兩人進入森林時。這兩位先生進入森林時，他們原本預期會發現墜毀的飛機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. Upon arriving at the suspected crash site, it immediately became apparent to both Penniston and Burroughs that they were not looking at a crashed aerial vehicle or, for that matter, any kind of vehicle they had ever seen. Suddenly, a blinding flash of white light emanated from that craft, instinctively causing Airman Burroughs, excuse me, Mr. Penniston and Burroughs to drop to the ground. As both men returned to their feet, they witnessed a triangular craft approximately nine feet long by six and a half feet wide at rest in a small clearing in the forest. Also observed were blue and yellow lights swirling around the exterior skin of the craft as if they were part of the craft's skin itself. The air in the vicinity of the craft felt electrically charged and was in fact so full of static electricity they could feel it all over their clothes, skin and throughout their hair. Nothing, absolutely

32. nothing in the military training of these men had prepared them for this encounter.
→ {"text": "沒有任何軍事訓練能讓這些人為這次遭遇做好準備。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. After perhaps ten minutes had passed without any recognizable aggression displayed by the craft, Mr. Penniston concluded there was no threat to either himself or Mr. Burroughs and the rest of his response team or, more importantly, to the Bentwaters base itself.
→ {"text": "大約十分鐘過去後，飛行器沒有顯示任何可辨識的攻擊性，潘尼斯頓先生判斷對他本人或巴勒斯先生及其他應變小組成員，更重要的是對 Bentwaters 基地本身，都沒有威脅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. Consequently, he commenced a thorough on-site inspection of the craft in accordance with the usual security protocols. His inspection of the craft included photographs, notebook entries and radio contact with Airman Kubancik for relay back to the Bentwaters Control Center.
→ {"text": "因此，他依照常規安全協議展開對飛行器的徹底現場檢查。他對飛行器的檢查包括拍照、筆記本記錄，以及透過無線電與卡班希克一等兵聯繫，以中繼回報給 Bentwaters 控制中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文拼寫為 Kubancik，但根據 terminology.yaml 應為 Kabancik"}

35. Mr. Penniston noted a row of symbols which was two and a half feet long and about three inches in height on one side of the craft. The symbols Mr. Penniston saw were pictorial and hieroglyphic like in design, the largest one being a triangle which was centered in the middle of others. All of the symbols were etched into the skin of the craft which was self-warmed to the touch and smooth as glass. Approximately 45 minutes after arriving on scene with the craft, it rapidly began to brighten. In response, both Penniston and Burroughs took defensive positions away from it and watched as the craft became airborne without generating any air or sound disturbance. The craft maneuvered through the trees as it ascended skyward then streaked away at an unbelievable rate of speed. In fact, Mr.
→ {"text": "潘尼斯頓先生注意到飛行器一側有一排符號，長約兩英呎半、高約三英吋。潘尼斯頓先生看到的符號是圖案式和象形文字般的設計，最大的符號是一個三角形，位於其他符號的中央。所有符號都蝕刻在飛行器的表面上，觸摸時感覺溫暖且光滑如玻璃。抵達現場大約四十五分鐘後，飛行器快速開始變亮。作為回應，潘尼斯頓和巴勒斯都採取了遠離飛行器的防禦姿勢，並看著飛行器升空，過程中沒有產生任何空氣擾動或聲音。飛行器在樹木間機動上升，然後以難以置信的速度疾馳而去。事實上，潘尼斯頓先生", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. Penniston described the craft's departure speed in his field notes as impossible. The craft's departure from the forest was observed not only by Mr. Penniston and Burroughs but by more than 40 Air Force personnel, all of whom were trained observers assigned to the 81st Security Police Squadron. The information acquired during Penniston and Burroughs' investigation in the forest was dutifully reported by them through normal military channels. Their team and other personnel who witnessed the craft were instructed to treat the investigation as top secret and not to discuss what they had seen. The camera film containing photographs of the craft Mr. Penniston took were turned into the base lab but when he picked them up they were strangely all overexposed rendering them useless. Add to this oddity that following the encounter in the forest both Penniston and Burroughs were interrogated by government

38. The previous description of the encounter Jim Penniston and John Burroughs had in Rendlesham Forest in late December of 1980 was not solitary. John Burroughs would join Colonel Charles Halt on another investigation in the forest two nights subsequent when an illuminated craft moved silently through the forest before becoming multiple aerial objects overhead.

39. Colonel Halt generated an official Air Force memorandum commonly referred to as the Halt Memo in which he memorializes this event. Moreover the Colonel has even stood in this very room we are in today and said he believed the objects were under intelligent control.
→ {"text": "霍爾特上校撰寫了一份正式的空軍備忘錄，通常稱為 Halt 備忘錄，其中記載了這一事件。此外，上校甚至曾站在我們今天所在的這個房間裡，表示他相信這些物體處於智慧控制之下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. Jim Penniston and John Burroughs both began suffering from physical ailments after their encounter in the forest. Ailments which did not exist prior to joining the Air Force but ailments which began almost immediately after exposure to the craft in the forest. These ailments have persisted in both men to this day. In 2011 I began assisting both gentlemen in propounding Freedom of Information Act requests on the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Department of the Air Force, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency via the Department of Defense, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. All of the previously listed divisions of our government responded to our inquiries for information regarding John and Jim by essentially saying they had nothing on file about them. The one exception

41. is the CIA's response which was the most frustrating of them all by their stating that they could neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of records responsive to our request. In other words none of the governmental entities we contacted, those we just named, even the Air Force seemed to know anything about a John Burroughs or a Jim Penniston despite the fact that we're all fairly certain they served in the United States Air Force for many years. We have repeatedly sought to obtain the medical records of John's and Jim's default requests but have yet to succeed. John's physicians in particular have requested his service medical records especially those related to what it was he and Jim came into contact with in the forest. They have requested this information time and time again from John in order to provide the best chance to treat his medical problems which have at times

42. been life-threatening. We even enlisted the help of a former senator from John's home state of Arizona but still did not get anything other than learning that the Veterans Administration has a classified records section. In closing I want to say that in December of 1980 I was thousands of miles away from Rendlesham Forest studying in college. I was completely unaware of the incident. I was completely unaware of these gentlemen. It would not be but for another 28 years in 2008 that I would first encounter that incident and become aware of it. But once I learned of their story I felt compelled to assist them however I could as this was an event of tremendous fascination, importance and one with casualties too. It has been cowardly the way their requests for medical records and the like have been rejected using excuses like we have no records responsive to your request or the requested records are

43. no longer under our purview. Nevertheless we continue undaunted in our search for these gentleman's medical records so that their physicians may properly treat them as John Burroughs once said to me Jim and I have been left behind on the battlefield of the Cold War. Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you very much for the both of your testimonies. It's very hard to explain why a country this great can treat our military so poorly. I want to yield now to Mr. Pennington. Sergeant are you prepared? Thank you madam. I appreciate that all of you are here today and I look forward to your questions and I'll try to answer them as honestly as I can. It's been 32 years though. There's a few gray areas that I can't recall on so I'll try to answer them as best as I can and keep it strictly to the facts. Thank you. Thank you sir and thank you for your service.
