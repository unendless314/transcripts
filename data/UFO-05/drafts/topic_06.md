## Speaker Group 23

118. I'll continue to pursue that line of questioning. I get my health services from the V.A., so I have some hands-on experience with them. Is this the first time you've brought your case in a public hearing? Or has it all been on direct contact through your attorney or through your own efforts with the V.A.? Is this the first time this is being made public?
→ {"text": "我會繼續追問這個問題。我本人從退伍軍人事務部獲得醫療服務，所以對他們有第一手經驗。這是你們第一次在公開聽證會上提出你們的案件嗎？還是之前都是透過你們的律師或你們自己直接與退伍軍人事務部聯繫？這是第一次公開嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

119. Yes, sir. What we were trying to do is work within the system, which has failed us so far, and trying to get some kind of, you know, care and results on what's going on. And like Mr. Friscona said, every time we reach a certain point, we get stonewalled. So at this point we felt it was time to make it public. Let me just give you a little bit of advice.
→ {"text": "是的，長官。我們一直試著在體制內運作，但到目前為止體制讓我們失望了，我們試圖獲得某種照顧和結果，了解到底發生了什麼。就像弗雷斯科納先生說的，每次我們到達某個點，就會被阻擋。所以現在我們覺得是時候公開了。讓我給你們一點建議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. You know, God helps those who help themselves. And so you've got to be a lot more aggressive.
→ {"text": "你們知道，天助自助者。所以你們必須更積極進取。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. When the political system that you interface with, not even got to the V.A. yet, was not responsive with any immediacy, and this is what Carol, the congresswoman, was referring to, is that, you know, it's a given on our side, in our activities, that when you have a case that just cries out for attention, you just put the muscle on it and you make sure that there's an intelligent response. And so I'm somewhat horrified to just hear your story, because, you know, we're dealing with bureaucracies, and bureaucracies are human beings, and some human beings are responsive, and some are not. And you clearly have run into a series of bad luck of those who aren't responsive. The classification problem that stymies me, that they would classify your records or not acknowledge that you had served, you have a discharge document, right? Okay. So that proves that you were somewhere for
→ {"text": "當你們接觸的政治系統，還沒到退伍軍人事務部那層，就沒有任何立即回應，這就是眾議員卡蘿所指的，你們知道，在我們這邊，在我們的工作中，這是基本原則，當你遇到一個迫切需要關注的案件，你就施加壓力，確保得到明智的回應。所以我聽到你們的故事感到有些震驚，因為，你們知道，我們在處理官僚體系，而官僚體系是由人組成的，有些人會回應，有些人不會。你們顯然遇到了一連串不回應的倒霉事。讓我困惑的機密問題是，他們會將你們的記錄列為機密或不承認你們曾服役，你們有退伍證明文件，對吧？好的。所以那證明你們曾在某處服役", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. some period of time. And so I just really want to say that get back on this. You'll obviously, there'll be some attention as a product of this hearing, but I think that you want to get back to your congressional persons and really be aggressive. This is just unfair. This is just gross incompetence and negligence on the part of the government.
→ {"text": "一段時間。所以我真的想說，繼續追究這件事。顯然，這次聽證會會帶來一些關注，但我認為你們應該回去找你們的國會議員，真正積極進取。這太不公平了。這只是政府方面的嚴重失職和疏忽。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. And you're the victims of this. And my wife and I, whenever I go to a doctor or I bring my wife along, you need an advocacy. You need somebody to stick on top of the issues, not just because you're somewhat in a bad situation when you're in front of a doctor, you're just giving them the information. Sometimes they're competent, sometimes they don't care. I had a doctor in the VA and she told me I really wasn't ill. I was wasting her time. There's more important people to see that are ill. Well, I made a complaint right to the top at that VA hospital and I want a new doctor, period. And the new doctor I got was a sympathetic, caring person and helped me a great deal. So you've got to take that responsibility on yourselves. And that's the best advice I can give you is be aggressive. Don't put up with this crap from a bureaucracy that's unresponsive and whether it's a congressional
→ {"text": "而你們是這件事的受害者。我和我太太，每當我去看醫生或我帶我太太一起去，你們需要有人陪同協助。你們需要有人緊盯這些問題，不僅僅是因為你們在醫生面前處於某種不利處境，你們只是提供資訊給他們。有時候他們很稱職，有時候他們不在乎。我在退伍軍人事務部有個醫生，她告訴我我其實沒病。我在浪費她的時間。還有更重要的病人要看。我直接向那家退伍軍人醫院的最高層投訴，我要換醫生，就這樣。我換到的新醫生是個有同情心、有愛心的人，對我幫助很大。所以你們必須自己承擔這個責任。這是我能給你們的最好建議，就是積極進取。不要容忍這些官僚體系的廢話，不管是國會", "confidence": "high", "notes": "advocacy 依據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「陪同協助」"}

124. area that's unresponsive or the VA that's unresponsive, you know, here again, squeaky wheel gets the grease. And so you've just got to do that. And you've got to take somebody with you to act as an advocate during an examination because you can't remember everything that they're saying to you. Let me ask, can you share with us a little bit more, first Jim and yourself, the physical problem that you're experiencing? Well, like I said earlier, it started out with the inner ear problem. Eventually... Which affects your balance. Right. But you know, if you do, if you're in that, have that condition long enough, you end up compensating quite a bit, you can do those things. They eventually did say it was Meniere's disease on separation, when they did do that. And I can get treated for that, which I do get medicine for that. But approximately two years after the incident, I mean, I got violently
→ {"text": "部門不回應還是退伍軍人事務部不回應，你們知道，會吵的孩子有糖吃。所以你們就是得這麼做。而且你們在檢查時必須帶個人一起去當協助者，因為你們無法記住他們對你們說的所有事情。讓我問一下，吉姆，還有你自己，能不能多分享一點你們遇到的身體問題？呃，就像我之前說的，一開始是內耳問題。最後……會影響你的平衡。對。但你們知道，如果你處於那種狀況夠久，你最終會相當程度地適應，你可以做那些事情。他們最終在我退伍時確實說那是梅尼爾氏症，當他們這麼做的時候。我可以接受治療，我確實有拿藥治療。但大約在事件發生兩年後，我的意思是，我病得很厲害", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Meniere's disease 依據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「梅尼爾氏症」"}

125. sick and I got put in the hospital and apparently I had my heart infection and it was heart related and I've never had anything like that before. And I almost died. It was a touch and go situation. And anyway, I pulled through it and I like to have those records. Why would that happen? And everything they come up with, they always ask... Are these records VA now or private records? Well, these are US Air Force. Okay. When I was in... During, when you were in service? Sure. Or active duty. Yes. In your VA records right now, is it on a computer? In other words, are you in the system at this point? Yes, I'm in the system for the Meniere's part. The other stuff, they won't treat it. But everything should be in the computer. In other words, it's a history and the Congress has appropriated a lot of money to get this down. If the gentleman will yield to me one minute. I sure will. It's
→ {"text": "然後我被送進醫院，顯然我心臟感染了，是心臟相關的問題，我以前從來沒有過這種情況。我差點死掉。當時情況很危急。無論如何，我挺過來了，我想要那些記錄。為什麼會發生那種事？他們提出的每個問題，他們總是問……這些記錄現在是退伍軍人事務部的還是私人記錄？呃，這些是美國空軍的。好的。當我在……在你服役期間？沒錯。或現役時？是的。你現在的退伍軍人事務部記錄，在電腦裡嗎？換句話說，你現在在系統裡嗎？是的，我在系統裡，梅尼爾氏症那部分。其他東西，他們不會治療。但所有東西應該都在電腦裡。換句話說，這是病史，國會已經撥了很多錢來建立這個系統。如果這位先生願意讓我一分鐘。當然可以。是這樣的", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. my understanding that they started from a certain point and went forward. They have these guys' records in a box somewhere or in a file cabinet or something. And they intend to bring it all up to date. But I would guess that they're not for back then when they don't even acknowledge they were in the Air Force, that it's in the computer. How old are you?
→ {"text": "我的理解是他們從某個時間點開始往前建檔。他們把這些人的記錄放在某個箱子裡或檔案櫃之類的地方。他們打算把所有東西都更新到最新。但我猜想，對於那時候的記錄，當他們甚至不承認他們在空軍服役過時，那些記錄不會在電腦裡。你幾歲？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. I'm 58. Okay. So, I'm old enough that I bounce one from the other. If I'm not happy, I'll go to Medicare or VA, preferably VA. And your age? 52, sir. Okay. You both got a little bit of time to wait. But in your case, there's no record at all of you in the VA system?
→ {"text": "我 58 歲。好的。所以，我年紀夠大，可以在兩邊跑。如果我不滿意，我會去聯邦醫療保險或退伍軍人事務部，最好是退伍軍人事務部。你的年齡呢？52 歲，長官。好的。你們兩位都還得等一段時間。但在你的情況下，退伍軍人事務部系統完全沒有你的記錄嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. Okay. Two things happened with Senator Kyl. Number one, when he initially requested my records, they didn't exist. They weren't where they were supposed to be. And after a second letter was sent, and it was interesting the way the St. Louis treated him, they told him they'd try to look into it for him. They said, "We'll try to locate his records, but they're not where they belong." Eventually, they were able to get part of my personnel records released.
→ {"text": "好的。凱爾參議員那邊發生了兩件事。第一，當他最初要求我的記錄時，那些記錄不存在。它們不在應該在的地方。在寄出第二封信之後，聖路易斯對待他的方式很有意思，他們告訴他們會試著為他調查。他們說：「我們會試著找到他的記錄，但它們不在應該在的地方。」最後，他們能夠釋出我的部分人事記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Senator Kyl 依據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「凱爾參議員」"}

129. Okay? And then from the personnel records, my DD form 214 is missing from 79 to 82. When I went in and saw the doctor, she was the one that brought up to me that there was no medical records in her file that she had received for me from 79 to 82. And she looked at me funny and said, "There's no record of you being in the Air Force from 79 to 82." And I pulled out a piece of paper that I brought with me showing where I came in the Air Force enlisted in 1979. And I also showed her the physical showing that I came in with no heart problems, and my exit physical with heart problems. And that changed her attitude towards me at that point. And again, like I said, she looked at me and said, "There's some things that we don't have need to know." And I said to her, I says, "Well, how are you going to do a fair evaluation on my case? Because you're the one that's going to recommend whether

131. Well, yeah, that's sort of pattern. I hate to admit this as a former senator, but my experience generally has been that you get better casework from the House member than you do from the senator. And I hate to admit that, but that's a fact.
→ {"text": "嗯，是的，這是某種模式。我很不想承認這點，身為前參議員，但我的經驗通常是，你從眾議員那裡得到的個案服務比從參議員那裡得到的更好。我很不想承認這點，但這是事實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. Can I bring up a point?
→ {"text": "我可以提出一點嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. Sir, can I bring up a point though? The reason why we contacted Senator Kyl was his vast experience in helping veterans. He had a vast staff in Phoenix, then we did our research that their job, and they were very successful at helping veterans solve their cases.
→ {"text": "長官，不過我可以提出一點嗎？我們聯繫凱爾參議員的原因是他在協助退伍軍人方面有豐富經驗。他在鳳凰城有龐大的幕僚團隊，然後我們做了研究，那是他們的工作，而且他們在協助退伍軍人解決案件方面非常成功。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. Were they successful helping you?

135. No, sir, they weren't. And she was very frustrated.

136. That's my case right there.
→ {"text": "那就是我的案件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. Right. She was very frustrated with me. When I met face to face with her, she told me, "You're probably never going to know what happened to you, but hopefully we can at least get you some care." That's what the aide told me.
→ {"text": "對。她對我感到非常沮喪。當我與她面對面時，她告訴我：「你可能永遠不會知道你發生了什麼事，但希望我們至少能讓你獲得一些照顧。」那位助理是這麼告訴我的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. They've got to learn what happened to you, because you can't go to a doctor and have a mystery or have a void, because they can't practice medicine that way. I'm fascinated by one thing. I'd like to move away from the VA. And again, let me, it's your responsibility to be aggressive and not take no for an answer. You've served, you paid your dues, and you're entitled to be taken care of by the country that you've served. So if you're not getting satisfaction here, go there, but be aggressive. The thing that I'm fascinated by, now, you did not touch the craft. He touched the craft, right?
→ {"text": "他們必須了解你發生了什麼事，因為你不能去看醫生時有個謎團或空白，因為他們無法那樣行醫。有件事讓我很著迷。我想從退伍軍人事務部的話題移開。再說一次，讓我說，積極進取並且不接受拒絕是你們的責任。你們服過役，你們盡了義務，你們有權得到你們所服務的國家的照顧。所以如果你們在這裡得不到滿意的結果，就去那裡，但要積極進取。讓我著迷的事情是，現在，你沒有觸摸飛行器。他觸摸了飛行器，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. No, sir, I did not touch the craft.
→ {"text": "不，長官，我沒有觸摸飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. Okay. Now, I want you to walk us through. You're walking up to it, and you touch it.

142. Okay. Well, after the explosion of light, and we did hit the ground, I mean, I thought it was going to explode.

143. That's good training.
→ {"text": "那是良好的訓練。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. I mean, it was reaction. So there was no noise. So I got up and compiled myself, just composed myself just a little bit, and I said, "Well, I got to do what I'm supposed to do. I need to investigate and get as much information as I can and report it back to some of the higher pay grade, you know, who can make a decision on this." I felt since there was no reaction from it at the beginning, it was non-hostile. I mean, it didn't look like it was going to go anywhere. It looked like it was fixed. It was going to stay there. So I started doing the walk around 360 of the object, and as I came around, I seen there was an inscription on the front, and I was actually relieved. I thought it was going to say United States Air Force, Nassau, some product. I was looking for that. And when I seen the glyphs, I, you know, your imagination does, when I went into that forest, I never

148. That's what I saw. So, you know, I'm having a hard time rationalizing this because I really wanted it to be an aircraft crash, too. I mean, there's all kinds of things I wanted it to be because it didn't look like an aircraft crash. I was just trying to make it an aircraft crash because we lost contact, you know, prior to 15 minutes. I said, "It gave us permission to go off." So I started walking around the craft, and I seen the glyphs, and as I, you know, ran my hand from the fabric of the craft, it was smooth to touch.
→ {"text": "那就是我看到的。所以，你們知道，我很難合理化這件事，因為我也真的希望那是飛機墜毀。我的意思是，我希望它是各種東西，因為它看起來不像飛機墜毀。我只是試圖把它當成飛機墜毀，因為我們失去聯繫，你們知道，在 15 分鐘之前。我說：「它准許我們離開。」所以我開始繞著飛行器走，我看到那些象形符號，當我，你們知道，用手撫摸飛行器的表面時，摸起來很光滑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. I was wondering how, sir, it was being, how it was sitting there in the forest. So there was light emulating underneath it. So as I looked down, there was no landing here, but it was up, off the ground, maybe two feet. So here I am, pushing the craft. It doesn't move. Nothing. As solid as can be. So I said, "Okay." So I start running my hand across it.

159. No, it was my own skin. Anyway, I figured the temperature of it might have been 45, 50 degrees. Unbeknownst to me, it probably was radioactive, and that's probably why it was warm.

171. Some local people were aware of this incident almost immediately, and indeed, there are a number of civilian witnesses who have gone on the record with that. The document that you'll have from the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Holt, was made public in 1983, but for many years, this was the only piece of paper that had been released in that way. But it was 1983 that it went public.

172. And why was there... So it went public, but before that, was there any... Did they try to cover up that this thing had landed? Yes. My understanding is that a number of local reporters, and indeed, a number of local investigators of strange phenomena, were aware that something had happened, questioned aggressively the great base press office, were told that nothing had occurred. And it was only when this document was released under the Freedom of Information Act that the authorities were forced to say, "Oh, yes, we did have an incident."

173. But even then, it was downplayed. Okay. Were there other members of the military that were out there walking around the craft like you were?
→ {"text": "但即使如此，也被淡化了。好的。還有其他軍事人員在那裡像你那樣繞著飛行器走嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. No, ma'am. I was the only one that walked around a craft. John was incapacitated at the time, so by whatever visual lighting that was causing him to be enveloped in it, he just recently came public with that. And I've known about that for years, but this is a human journey we're going through also, to be able to deal with certain emotional issues with it. And so John just went public with that.

The second night, there was a small incident where they observed lights again in the forest moving around and they sent two personnel out to investigate. One of them is the on-duty shift commander.
