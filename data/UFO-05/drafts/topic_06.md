## Speaker Group 23

118. I'll continue to pursue that line of questioning. I get my health services from the V.A., so I have some hands-on experience with them. Is this the first time you've brought your case in a public hearing? Or has it all been on direct contact through your attorney or through your own efforts with the V.A.? Is this the first time this is being made public?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. Yes, sir. What we were trying to do is work within the system, which has failed us so far, and trying to get some kind of, you know, care and results on what's going on. And like Mr. Friscona said, every time we reach a certain point, we get stonewalled. So at this point we felt it was time to make it public. Let me just give you a little bit of advice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. You know, God helps those who help themselves. And so you've got to be a lot more aggressive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. When the political system that you interface with, not even got to the V.A. yet, was not responsive with any immediacy, and this is what Carol, the congresswoman, was referring to, is that, you know, it's a given on our side, in our activities, that when you have a case that just cries out for attention, you just put the muscle on it and you make sure that there's an intelligent response. And so I'm somewhat horrified to just hear your story, because, you know, we're dealing with bureaucracies, and bureaucracies are human beings, and some human beings are responsive, and some are not. And you clearly have run into a series of bad luck of those who aren't responsive. The classification problem that stymies me, that they would classify your records or not acknowledge that you had served, you have a discharge document, right? Okay. So that proves that you were somewhere for
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. some period of time. And so I just really want to say that get back on this. You'll obviously, there'll be some attention as a product of this hearing, but I think that you want to get back to your congressional persons and really be aggressive. This is just unfair. This is just gross incompetence and negligence on the part of the government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. And you're the victims of this. And my wife and I, whenever I go to a doctor or I bring my wife along, you need an advocacy. You need somebody to stick on top of the issues, not just because you're somewhat in a bad situation when you're in front of a doctor, you're just giving them the information. Sometimes they're competent, sometimes they don't care. I had a doctor in the VA and she told me I really wasn't ill. I was wasting her time. There's more important people to see that are ill. Well, I made a complaint right to the top at that VA hospital and I want a new doctor, period. And the new doctor I got was a sympathetic, caring person and helped me a great deal. So you've got to take that responsibility on yourselves. And that's the best advice I can give you is be aggressive. Don't put up with this crap from a bureaucracy that's unresponsive and whether it's a congressional
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. area that's unresponsive or the VA that's unresponsive, you know, here again, squeaky wheel gets the grease. And so you've just got to do that. And you've got to take somebody with you to act as an advocate during an examination because you can't remember everything that they're saying to you. Let me ask, can you share with us a little bit more, first Jim and yourself, the physical problem that you're experiencing? Well, like I said earlier, it started out with the inner ear problem. Eventually... Which affects your balance. Right. But you know, if you do, if you're in that, have that condition long enough, you end up compensating quite a bit, you can do those things. They eventually did say it was Meniere's disease on separation, when they did do that. And I can get treated for that, which I do get medicine for that. But approximately two years after the incident, I mean, I got violently
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. sick and I got put in the hospital and apparently I had my heart infection and it was heart related and I've never had anything like that before. And I almost died. It was a touch and go situation. And anyway, I pulled through it and I like to have those records. Why would that happen? And everything they come up with, they always ask... Are these records VA now or private records? Well, these are US Air Force. Okay. When I was in... During, when you were in service? Sure. Or active duty. Yes. In your VA records right now, is it on a computer? In other words, are you in the system at this point? Yes, I'm in the system for the Meniere's part. The other stuff, they won't treat it. But everything should be in the computer. In other words, it's a history and the Congress has appropriated a lot of money to get this down. If the gentleman will yield to me one minute. I sure will. It's
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. my understanding that they started from a certain point and went forward. They have these guys' records in a box somewhere or in a file cabinet or something. And they intend to bring it all up to date. But I would guess that they're not for back then when they don't even acknowledge they were in the Air Force, that it's in the computer. How old are you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. I'm 58. Okay. So, I'm old enough that I bounce one from the other. If I'm not happy, I'll go to Medicare or VA, preferably VA. And your age? 52, sir. Okay. You both got a little bit of time to wait. But in your case, there's no record at all of you in the VA system?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. Okay. Two things happened with Senator Kyle. Number one, when he initially requested my records, they didn't exist. They weren't where they were supposed to be. And after a second letter was sent, and it was interesting the way the St. Louis treated him, they told him they'd try to look into it for him. They said, "We'll try to locate his records, but they're not where they belong." Eventually, they were able to get part of my personnel records released.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. Okay? And then from the personnel records, my DD form 214 is missing from 79 to 82. When I went in and saw the doctor, she was the one that brought up to me that there was no medical records in her file that she had received for me from 79 to 82. And she looked at me funny and said, "There's no record of you being in the Air Force from 79 to 82." And I pulled out a piece of paper that I brought with me showing where I came in the Air Force enlisted in 1979. And I also showed her the physical showing that I came in with no heart problems, and my exit physical with heart problems. And that changed her attitude towards me at that point. And again, like I said, she looked at me and said, "There's some things that we don't have need to know." And I said to her, I says, "Well, how are you going to do a fair evaluation on my case? Because you're the one that's going to recommend whether
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. I receive disability and what kind of treatment I get. Am I correct?" And she said, "Yes, sir." And she says, "Well, sir, what I can tell you is there might be somebody above me that'll have to look into this incident at this point."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. Well, yeah, that's sort of pattern. I hate to admit this as a former senator, but my experience generally has been that you get better casework from the House member than you do from the senator. And I hate to admit that, but that's a fact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. Can I bring up a point?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. Sir, can I bring up a point though? The reason why we contacted Senator Kyle was his vast experience in helping veterans. He had a vast staff in Phoenix, then we did our research that their job, and they were very successful at helping veterans solve their cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. Were they successful helping you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. No, sir, they weren't. And she was very frustrated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. That's my case right there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. Right. She was very frustrated with me. When I met face to face with her, she told me, "You're probably never going to know what happened to you, but hopefully we can at least get you some care." That's what the aide told me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. They've got to learn what happened to you, because you can't go to a doctor and have a mystery or have a void, because they can't practice medicine that way. I'm fascinated by one thing. I'd like to move away from the VA. And again, let me, it's your responsibility to be aggressive and not take no for an answer. You've served, you paid your dues, and you're entitled to be taken care of by the country that you've served. So if you're not getting satisfaction here, go there, but be aggressive. The thing that I'm fascinated by, now, you did not touch the craft. He touched the craft, right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. No, sir, I did not touch the craft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. Okay. Now, I want you to walk us through. You're walking up to it, and you touch it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. What do you do? Touch it, that? Do you grab it? Tell us about that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. Okay. Well, after the explosion of light, and we did hit the ground, I mean, I thought it was going to explode.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. That's good training.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. I mean, it was reaction. So there was no noise. So I got up and compiled myself, just composed myself just a little bit, and I said, "Well, I got to do what I'm supposed to do. I need to investigate and get as much information as I can and report it back to some of the higher pay grade, you know, who can make a decision on this." I felt since there was no reaction from it at the beginning, it was non-hostile. I mean, it didn't look like it was going to go anywhere. It looked like it was fixed. It was going to stay there. So I started doing the walk around 360 of the object, and as I came around, I seen there was an inscription on the front, and I was actually relieved. I thought it was going to say United States Air Force, Nassau, some product. I was looking for that. And when I seen the glyphs, I, you know, your imagination does, when I went into that forest, I never
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. believed in UFOs, ET alien, and I still don't, by the way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. This is what you saw, right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. That's what I saw. So, you know, I'm having a hard time rationalizing this because I really wanted it to be an aircraft crash, too. I mean, there's all kinds of things I wanted it to be because it didn't look like an aircraft crash. I was just trying to make it an aircraft crash because we lost contact, you know, prior to 15 minutes. I said, "It gave us permission to go off." So I started walking around the craft, and I seen the glyphs, and as I, you know, ran my hand from the fabric of the craft, it was smooth to touch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. You ran your hands along it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. Yeah, I started feeling it, and I said, "Well, the first thing I looked at was underneath it," because I said, "How's this being fixed?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. Excuse me for a moment for the record. I yield to you in an additional couple of minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. Thank you. I'll take whatever I can get.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. You know, I was wondering how...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. Just to conclude it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. I was wondering how, sir, it was being, how it was sitting there in the forest. So there was light emulating underneath it. So as I looked down, there was no landing here, but it was up, off the ground, maybe two feet. So here I am, pushing the craft. It doesn't move. Nothing. As solid as can be. So I said, "Okay." So I start running my hand across it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. Was it humming when you tried to...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. There was complete silence. There was, the air temperature at that time was about 32 degrees. When I touched the craft, it felt like metal, smooth metal, and I would say, and this is an estimate, guess...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. Did you have gloves on, or was it your own skin?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. No, it was my own skin. Anyway, I figured the temperature of it might have been 45, 50 degrees. Unbeknownst to me, it probably was radioactive, and that's probably why it was warm. I didn't realize that at the time. Then as I walked around it, I knew it was nothing that we had, and it surely wasn't nothing the Russians had. No, it was beyond our technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. Thank you very much. All I wanted to do is leave one, two words with you. Question authority.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. Just don't take...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. Question authority.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. In the sergeant's defense, in the military, you just do what you're told, and you do your job. All you all know that. You're a senator, so that makes a difference. You get a little bit more out of that, but no, your point...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. We don't know until...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. I know. I know. We do have to do that, particularly in today's world, for sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. I walk in, and I get good care as a human being. They don't know that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. No, I don't believe that. Yeah, okay. Excuse me. Congresswoman Hooley.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for taking your time to testify. I found it fascinating.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. When this aircraft landed, how long did it take for the public to find out that this object, this aircraft, this thing had landed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. Some local people were aware of this incident almost immediately, and indeed, there are a number of civilian witnesses who have gone on the record with that. The document that you'll have from the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Holt, was made public in 1983, but for many years, this was the only piece of paper that had been released in that way. But it was 1983 that it went public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. And why was there... So it went public, but before that, was there any... Did they try to cover up that this thing had landed? Yes. My understanding is that a number of local reporters, and indeed, a number of local investigators of strange phenomena, were aware that something had happened, questioned aggressively the great base press office, were told that nothing had occurred. And it was only when this document was released under the Freedom of Information Act that the authorities were forced to say, "Oh, yes, we did have an incident."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. But even then, it was downplayed. Okay. Were there other members of the military that were out there walking around the craft like you were?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. No, ma'am. I was the only one that walked around a craft. John was incapacitated at the time, so by whatever visual lighting that was causing him to be enveloped in it, he just recently came public with that. And I've known about that for years, but this is a human journey we're going through also, to be able to deal with certain emotional issues with it. And so John just went public with that. But that's one of the things I kept secret until he was ready, what was happening to him. And the poor guy, one night wasn't enough, he did it on two nights. Same thing happened to him. So it's very disturbing, actually, for me to even think that would happen to somebody. You know, I was helpless.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. I did what I had to do. I figured I was going to die out there that night. So I figured I was going to get as much information, do my job. And well, we're here. So I was wrong.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. Were you the only two out there? No. Okay. On the first night. This actual incident took place over three nights. Okay. Three nights. Okay. And if you look at the halt memo, you'll see that the date is wrong on the first night when it started. That was one of the things that we've questioned and we were able to prove eventually that the initial date that he put down was not wrong, was not correct. But the first night was our incident. The second night, there was a small incident where they observed lights again in the forest moving around and they sent two personnel out to investigate. One of them is the on-duty shift commander. At one point, a beam of light shot down at their vehicle, threw it, and shut the vehicle off. At that point, she was so upset she was relieved of duty and sent home for the rest of the night. On the third night, which is the Colonel Halt incident, which
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. he describes in the memo, there were several areas of reported, you know, incidents that went on. But one of the most interesting parts is he recorded a tape. I believe it's about what, 13 minutes long, Nick? Was it 13? 17 minutes long of real-time what was going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. If you get a chance to listen to the tape, at one point you're going to hear him. Now whatever it is is coming at us from the south. There's a beam of light shining down on our feet. This is unreal. And you should hear the emotion in his voice. And this is a front-line officer that was a combat controller at one point. And you can clearly hear the concern in his voice. So there was several other incidents that took place also besides ours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. So how many people actually saw this? Did anybody, I mean, I would think you were in a base or near a base, right? We were probably 300 yards from Woodbridge, working that night at Woodbridge and in Bentwaters. I know he said 40. That's probably the security flight with LA. It might have ran up to 60, maybe. I don't know, a little less. Of course, we also had, you know, like fire department and those folks. There was other people that seen this on night one. Right. And then, of course, there was the civilian numbers that we found out later on. We didn't realize how many there were. We thought it was pretty isolated as far as anybody seeing it. But we were wrong about that too. Yeah, I would have thought that someone would have probably come out and recorded it and looked at it and taken some of it. Did any other people, do you know, touch it? No, I was the only one out there
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. that made physical contact. It's a hard question for me because John received contact too, but it wasn't, I don't believe, with a physical object. It was, he was engulfed in a beam of light out there. It also happened on the third night. I don't know why with him. That's even more fascinating why it would even happen twice. I mean, that's the unusual part of this. I mean, here you got a landing of craft of unknown origin. That's what I put in my report because I'm in the Air Force and that's what we do. We don't use those other words.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. And then on the, what, two days later, it's back and the base commander, the deputy base commander is going to put this to bed. He's going to debunk it. And his life changed too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. So that's the way it came down and the way it worked. And all we want is, okay, an incident happened and we just want to be taken care of over it. And there's a lot of other veterans that were working that night. We also have access to about 240 of the other security policemen that were stationed at that twin bases there. And some of them have similar problems too. And we would, we'd like to, you know, we're working for them too, not just ourselves. So. >> Have you reconnected with some of the people that were there that night? >> Right. And I want you to know that the, I want to add this in. I know this wasn't a question, ma'am, but I want you to know that the wing commander, the base commander, those folks when we went in and gave them a sanitized version of what happened, because we were instructed to give them a sanitized
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. version from OSI. They never asked one question, the wing commander. It's like he knew everything was going on out there. And we found documents recently that show why he reacted that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. So what should have happened if there was any doubt on our credibility or any doubt on our mental state, any doubt, any activity at all, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Air Force personal reliability program, PRP. That's when each, all of us had the responsibility to look at the other person they're working with and say, well, he's acting odd or something strange or some odd behavior. You're supposed to report it immediately.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. What should have happened if there was any suspicion at all that we were not being completely honest or with the command element, they should have relieved us of duty for 30 days, had a medical evaluation, and then at 30-day mark, decide whether or not they're going to permanently decertify us under PRP or return us to duty. None of that happened. It's because we went out and reported what we'd seen. They believed everything we said. And then to reinforce it three nights later, Colonel Halt and his team go out. And when Colonel Halt called us in the office a few days later, like five days later after the first night, I was so happy to hear him say that he had an experience out there and he was backing up what I was saying from the first night. I said, good, it's off my shoulders. I got a soon-to-be full colonel taking responsibility, saying, OK, I'll take the fight from this point on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. And he did, actually.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. In trying to get help through the military, has he collaborated? I mean, has he been there for you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. Yes. The end result is what we looked at. And he has done up a letter that said that we were out there at a certain time and what happened. And we encountered a craft on an origin. He eludes to that. And he says that we were probably exposed to radiation. And this letter he did for us to go to the VA. So we are being aggressive with it that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. I have no problem being aggressive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. Good. You need to be aggressive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. I'm a retired sergeant. I have no problem doing that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
