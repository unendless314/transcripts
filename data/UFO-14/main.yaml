    the only encounter with a UFO was my encounter, and so the date of this memorandum
    was about 28 days later, so there were no other occurrences at the same base,
    so I believe in the sharing of information, you can see that this was the event
    being referred to.

  source_text: answer somewhat short, but. Yes, we for the last 33 years have had
    an Air Force commission that also is accountable to the public on all issues dealing
    with UFOs. This commission also has military and civilian members, and also does
    have archives of 1300 cases that had been investigated, 3% of which, there are
    39 or 40 cases now that have not been solved because of the level of bizarreness
    that they presented, and Uruguay has scientifically addressed the UFO issue and
    does not rule out the extraterrestrial element, but for this we do need scientific
    evidence. We do have cases, such as that which Colonel Santa Maria mentioned,
    and how fighter jets were scrambled to chase these objects, and how there was
    a chase, an in-air chase, and following glowing objects, and sometimes they would
    get close to, and how these objects would get close to air bases throughout Latin
    America.

    persons, two human-like creatures inside of it operating that spaceship. This

    crashes. It has been said here in this table and during the preceding years and
    days that crashes of UFOs have happened, most of them in old days. But there is
    at least one recent crash and it took place in Brazil in 1996. It is called the
    Varginha case in which an alien spacecraft crashed and at least two creatures
    were captured and offered no resistance to its capture.

    started. As soon as the space age took off in 1957, then the Air Force created
    this project, Moon Dust, for the recovery of space debris. But according to one
    document, they list space debris, and in those days only two countries had space
    projects. That was the United States and the Soviet Union. And then it says unidentified
    flying objects in the same document. So when this incident happened, two officers
    from the Defense Attaché Office, which were stationed in La Paz, the capital of
    Bolivia, somehow showed up in this remote area. And unfortunately for them, as
    they were coming in the airport, they were photographed by a local reporter.

      Paz）的國防武官辦公室軍官，不知怎麼地出現在這個偏遠地區。而對他們來說不幸的是，當他們抵達機場時，被一名當地記者拍到了照片。

    really retrieved and taken back to the US, or it may still be there, because it
    was in an extremely remote area, and there had been like a landslide on a mountain.
    There was an expedition initially by the army, by the Bolivian army, under a lieutenant,
    and they finally got to the area, but they didn't have the equipment and the facilities
    to do something. And there are some rumors that something was retrieved and taken

    the attitude of both the people and your press? We'll start with Mr. Gevaerd.
    Thank you. This is definitely not a matter of belief. There is a lot of data that
    has been produced by civilian UFO researchers, military UFO researchers, very
    few but very dedicated scientists for the last 60 years to confirm without any
    question at all that we are being visited by several species of more advanced,

    in mainstream newspapers. So it would be like here being covered by the Washington
    Post, by the New York Times, but seriously, or at least semi-seriously. There
    is some ridicule, of course, but not as bad as the US. The scientific community,
    on the other hand, has been very conservative, generally speaking, in Latin America.
    I would say that there might be more scientists quietly doing research in the
    US than in Latin America. Although that is changing.

    Force does not rule out the hypothesis that these are extraterrestrials. This

    probes, something else, but we need scientific evidence to prove it. That's why
    our commission works using scientific methodologies, but we do so through the
    Air Force. I believe that people's attitude and the media's attitude in Uruguay
    are very respectful, given the fact that for 33 years, the Air Force has been
    spearheading UFO investigations in Uruguay. And so I believe that the Uruguayan
    people have reliable and transparent official information and understand that.

    aeronautic or space research. So I think that's why there's greater acceptance.
    However, in the case of the United States, it's something that we all know. Defense
    is very important, and so they have to keep some secrets when it comes to sharing
    information. I've heard people mention over these days that these UFOs could be
    a new prototype of an unmanned aircraft, and that might make things difficult
    for the Department of Defense or especially for companies that build these, you
    know, Lockheed or Boeing. And that's why I believe that there are greater reservations,

    been flying around out there. That's at least my personal opinion.

    hard to be interviewed. It was hard to kind of open this Pandora box of the subject.
    But I saw, all over the world, I've seen this changing. For example, with series
    of history channel, ancient aliens, or UFO hunters, the people is kind of totally
    more open. Today, for example, we are discovering planets similar to the Earth

    continue to analyze it? And in 2010, there was a home in Lima, the capital of
    Peru, where there was a phenomenon where things started flying, floating around,
    things exploded. And there was a cell phone from the house owner. It was found
    in another house. And 25 people saw how that particular cell phone disappeared
    from one house and appeared in another house. And it wasn't that it flew from
    one place.

  source_text: The Argentina government doesn't pronounce the extraterrestrial hypothesis
    open, but in the history of our traditions, for example, in 1968, the president
    of Argentina, General Onganía, said, "I believe in the flying saucers." Yo creo
    en los platos voladores. That openness always exists. In that case, it was the
    president of a nation. But the government is investigating the UFOs with scientifically
    correctness in this moment. And in the future, maybe it will be some pronunciation.
    That is it.

  source_text: I want to thank our panel for being here today. This has been really
    interesting, and your openness and what's happening in each of your countries
    has been, I think, a real eye-opener for the rest of us. And with that, I'm going
    to conclude this hearing. We will be back here at 1.45.
