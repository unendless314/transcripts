  source_text: There was a journalist, Edwin Cain, and there was a filmmaker, James Fox, who was making a documentary, and
    they turned over a copy of this document to me, and they said, "We would like to invite you to our country, because our
    country has accredited this encounter," and so when I reviewed the data in 1980, the only encounter with a UFO was my
    encounter, and so the date of this memorandum was about 28 days later, so there were no other occurrences at the same
    base, so I believe in the sharing of information, you can see that this was the event being referred to.

    might have been, but they all had some type of engine, there was nothing similar to what I had observed.

  source_text: answer somewhat short, but. Yes, we for the last 33 years have had an Air Force commission that also is accountable
    to the public on all issues dealing with UFOs. This commission also has military and civilian members, and also does have
    archives of 1300 cases that had been investigated, 3% of which, there are 39 or 40 cases now that have not been solved
    because of the level of bizarreness that they presented, and Uruguay has scientifically addressed the UFO issue and does
    not rule out the extraterrestrial element, but for this we do need scientific evidence. We do have cases, such as that
    which Colonel Santa Maria mentioned, and how fighter jets were scrambled to chase these objects, and how there was a chase,
    an in-air chase, and following glowing objects, and sometimes they would get close to, and how these objects would get
    close to air bases throughout Latin America.

    an investigatory point of view to the apparent violent attacks that took place in the Amazon area, killing people. Now,
    that's the first, at least that I am aware of anywhere in the world, where an aggressive attack resulting in loss of life
    that was the product of a flying saucer, extraterrestrial effort. Could you elaborate a little bit more specifically on
    the investigation that was made over the death of these people? Yes.

    '78, we had casualties, at least four casualties, and we have a record of 400 people attacked. Not only people, but also
    animals were attacked by these beams of light that would come from these balls, these spaceships. Sometimes they were
    referred to like a can with a windshield and two persons, two human-like creatures inside of it operating that spaceship.
    This has been described in detail by lots of people who live in the area of Salgado, especially in the island of Colares,
    which is 60 or 70 miles from the city of Belém.

    decided to camp there and to conduct their investigations, the attacks stopped. Very rare attacks took place in other
    areas, but not where the military were. Also, when the military decided to change their camping from one point of the
    island to another point of the island, the objects that would be hovering, that previous point where the operations were
    taking place, would move to the other area, like in the own words of the commander of the Operation Saucer, Uyrangê Hollanda,
    like if these intelligences knew what the military were doing in that area. That's very amazing. These are only 440 pages
    of a total of 2,000 pages that were produced as a result of the Operation Saucer. I would like to address this to you.

    he retired as a coronel. And 20 years after the Operation Saucer was shut down, this man called me and invited me to his
    place, to his house in Rio de Janeiro where he was living. And I spent two days with him, interviewing him extensively
    where he gave me full details of everything that happened during those four months. And he also described me how he and
    his men had a close encounter with the creatures that came in those objects. And that actually, this main encounter with
    an alien creature that took place in mid-December, 1977, was what caused the Operation Saucer to be shut down.

    among military and extraterrestrial start being regular in the Amazon, what we can do now. So then the Operation Saucer
    was shut down. But just to add a few more pieces of information that it was only asked to say shut down to make pretend,
    because the Operation Saucer then became, in a second level, much more secret and was conducted for several more months
    under military, US military command in Brazilian territory.

    you with more than 20 cases of Uruguay, official cases written by the first president of this group, Colonel Eduardo Aguirre,
    who wrote this book 11 years ago. It was published publicly so that the public could follow all of the ufological activity
    in Uruguay. There are also press conferences and the information is even taken to the schools to talk to them about this
    and even educate them on this issue. This commission is made up by both civil and military members. It has a work methodology
    that was adopted in 1979 and this methodology was also shared with China.

    from another world, they of course admit that there are UFOs. UFO simply means unidentified flying object. And the Air
    Force says that in their Project Blue Book there were 701 of them that they couldn't wish away some way or another. So
    they do admit they're unidentified flying objects. They simply are denying categorically, I think, that they could be
    of extraterrestrial origin. But while they seem to poo-poo the whole thing here and relegate it to the ha-ha corner, they
    apparently are aggressive in participating in investigations of USO sightings in South America. And I'd just like to start
    here with Mr. Gavard and go down the table and have you tell each of us briefly, is this true in your country and to what

    Johnetti, which happened in Bolivia. And we don't have anybody from Bolivia here, so I'll speak briefly about that case
    because I'm familiar with. And it's a crash too that took place in Tarija, which is on the border of Bolivia and Argentina

    these are officially released documents under the Freedom of Information Act, including a telex from Secretary of State

    off in 1957, then the Air Force created this project, Moon Dust, for the recovery of space debris. But according to one
    document, they list space debris, and in those days only two countries had space projects. That was the United States
    and the Soviet Union. And then it says unidentified flying objects in the same document. So when this incident happened,
    two officers from the Defense Attaché Office, which were stationed in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, somehow showed up
    in this remote area. And unfortunately for them, as they were coming in the airport, they were photographed by a local
    reporter.

    only a few documents. I'm sure there's plenty more. Where the case gets a little murky is as to whether something was
    really retrieved and taken back to the US, or it may still be there, because it was in an extremely remote area, and there
    had been like a landslide on a mountain. There was an expedition initially by the army, by the Bolivian army, under a
    lieutenant, and they finally got to the area, but they didn't have the equipment and the facilities to do something. And
    there are some rumors that something was retrieved and taken to the United States, but then according to an American reporter
    who did investigate this case, whose name was Bob Pratt, he's now deceased, he thinks that they never did retrieve, because
    it was such a remote area, so that object

    The only exchanges that we have had with the United States have been the recovery in 2011 of a star engine, Delta II,
    which fell over our airspace. I personally went to recover that object. But as regards to UFO issues, we have no exchange
    agreement with them, nor have we carried out any official exchange with them.

    which the Air Force Office is in charge of this, and through the public relations. But I understand that at another level,
    there is an official exchange of information. And this is a constant exchange of information we can see, because afterwards,
    we can see the information does make it to the United States when there are UFO crashes. For example, in the case that
    we mentioned before, the San Mato de Huancho in 1980, unfortunately, there are no official documents. Everything is at
    a secret level, but we have received many testimonies on exchange of information.

    William Jolanda, the captain that was commanding the Operation Saucer, and an extraterrestrial creature. It took place
    on mid-December 1977. And as part of his duties, the commander of the Operation Saucer has to go back to his commander,
    a brigadier in the city of Belen, and report weekly what was going on during the Operation Saucer. And when he did that
    that week, then when he informed to his superior that he had an actual encounter with a creature, two arms, two legs,
    a body, a head, with a helmet that came from a UFO, 300 feet long, that almost landed close to the Guajará-Mirim River.

    that has been produced by civilian UFO researchers, military UFO researchers, very few but very dedicated scientists for
    the last 60 years to confirm without any question at all that we are being visited by several species of more advanced,
    at least technologically, more advanced civilization that come here.

    photo of satellites, of Uranus, of the rings of Jupiter, of whatever. We are exploring our backyard. The difference is
    that our technology presently only allows us to explore this backyard. But if we're doing this now in 2013, in 20 years,
    in 30 years, in 50 years perhaps, we will be able to do interplanetary trips with crews inside our spaceships safely,
    effectively, go and come back. So if we can do this in the near future, and we're working on that definitely, this advanced
    civilization that started the evolutionary process much before us, they are doing the same. And they may have been doing
    the same for quite some time, perhaps

    say, in general, it is much more open than in the United States. Whenever there is an important UFO case, it gets covered
    in mainstream newspapers. So it would be like here being covered by the Washington Post, by the New York Times, but seriously,
    or at least semi-seriously. There is some ridicule, of course, but not as bad as the US. The scientific community, on
    the other hand, has been very conservative, generally speaking, in Latin America. I would say that there might be more
    scientists quietly doing research in the US than in Latin America. Although that is changing.

    don't want to be known as the UFO nut. So he said they're trying to condition them that it's okay.

    also changing. And of course, because they are with the Civil Aviation, that's their primary source of information. It
    usually comes from pilots who are, in the course of their flying, they're seeing something. They don't know if that is
    another air traffic or something else. So they will call the control tower, says, "Well, I see an object in that corner.
    Do you have any air traffic?" And then usually the control tower, well, in some cases they probably do, and then that's
    filed away, and it's not a UFO case. But in other cases, they don't. So then the control tower says, "No, we have no scheduled
    traffic there."

  source_text: Colonel Sanchez? Well, I wanted to tell you that the Uruguayan Air Force does not rule out the hypothesis that
    these are extraterrestrials. This phenomenon is one that we've seen occur in Uruguayan airspace. It could be different
    probes, something else, but we need scientific evidence to prove it. That's why our commission works using scientific
    methodologies, but we do so through the Air Force. I believe that people's attitude and the media's attitude in Uruguay
    are very respectful, given the fact that for 33 years, the Air Force has been spearheading UFO investigations in Uruguay.
    And so I believe that the Uruguayan people have reliable and transparent official information and understand that. The
    situation in each country is different. In the case of Brazil, United States, these are massive countries with large tracts
    of land and very sophisticated defense systems. It's not the

    think that's why there's greater acceptance. However, in the case of the United States, it's something that we all know.
    Defense is very important, and so they have to keep some secrets when it comes to sharing information. I've heard people
    mention over these days that these UFOs could be a new prototype of an unmanned aircraft, and that might make things difficult
    for the Department of Defense or especially for companies that build these, you know, Lockheed or Boeing. And that's why
    I believe that there are greater reservations, and I think that that's natural in terms of sharing information in terms
    of what's been flying around out there. That's at least my personal opinion.

    I'm struck by how this is addressed in the United States. They underscore the fact that these civilizations are potentially
    aggressive, you know, the nuclear aspects of this. That's very interesting, because we don't look at it that way. It seems
    like there might be politically correct extraterrestrials, you know, because they might be offensive in some way. But
    in Peru, when we hear about cases of encounters, we have very credible testimony of people who've had contact in many
    different cases. But it's always been with civilizations where there have been attempts made at engaging and having communication.

  source_text: If you look at the case of Santa Maria, where there was this "clash" and where all of the ammo was fired, you
    would expect a response from the others. But there was none. It seemed like it was like a cat and mouse game. And if they
    wanted to destroy it, they would, clearly with their technology, they would have been able to do that, and they haven't
    done it. So I think our approach is very different. It's not, we look at superior technology, not in military framework,
    but there are many visits that we are receiving. We have to look at it. Unfortunately, this is, we haven't been able to
    explain it scientifically yet.

    they've seen, what they've heard.

    that doesn't have any impact whatsoever on someone's career. And I'm very pleased that that's the case. In my experience
    with Argentina, I have three decades as a journalist, international, and I saw evolution. When I started, the media was
    more kind of, kind of, aseptic. It was hard to be interviewed. It was hard to kind of open this Pandora box of the subject.
    But I saw, all over the world, I've seen this changing. For example, with series of history channel, ancient aliens, or
    UFO hunters, the people is kind of totally more open. Today, for example, we are discovering planets similar to the Earth
    every day in the news. It's incredible how the astronomy and the exobiology is every day in your breakfast table in the
    newspaper. And that attitude also helped with the UFOs

    Every time I travel, I go to the cockpit to talk with the pilots, and the pilots have experiences different to the United
    States, who the pilots are more shy. And I say, "What happened? We have only activities out of the border and not here?"
    It's interesting.

    Airlines. I say, "No, they don't talk too much." But I think it's a totally paradigm shift. It's a shift now in all levels
    of consciousness. And I think it's positive for the new generations. When I was growing up as a ufologist, yeah, my own
    family was kind of, "Oh, he liked these subjects." And they were not kind of accepting that, also the media. But I think
    it's totally a new hope for all of us.

    it was an object that was unknown to me. I just wanted to see what it was. And I had to turn my back to return to the
    base. I thought, I don't know, maybe it's going to start chasing me now. But nothing of the sort happened.

    conduct our investigations. I can say that in 1993 we saw two luminous spheres hovering over a field in the interior part
    of Uruguay, these luminous spheres that measured about 30 or 40 centimeters, no more than that. They left prints where
    scientifically through laboratory studies we saw a diminishment of phosphorus and zinc and magnesium. So samples were
    taken from where it had touched the soil. We saw there were eight different tracks there.

    that have been underway for several years. We're working with Norway in an analysis of lights that have been seen hovering
    over Uruguay, over dams, in mountainous areas of rivers where there have been witnesses. We have photographs. We're trying
    to conduct a film and photographic analysis. And again, we're also working with Chile on this. We have a written agreement

    things exploded. And there was a cell phone from the house owner. It was found in another house. And 25 people saw how

  source_text: Thank you. Representative Cook? Yes. Colonel Santamaria, I'd like to ask you, so that we can do due diligence
    on any possible other explanation or hologram explanation, for example, could you tell us what your Air Squad commander
    ordered you to do that day? How many people on the ground witnessed the globe, as you described it initially, as about
    600 meters above the earth, at about five kilometers away from the base, and particularly interested in how long at speeds
    that you described as 1.6, up to 1.6 Mach speed, you did this, you kept this globe in your sights.

  source_text: It's not on the radar. We thought it might be spy equipment, and it was in restricted airspace for civilian
    flights. So I was given the order. This could be a spy object. And so I was given the order to pursue it. And so if it
    did not move away, I was supposed to engage it with fire. So 1,800 people witnessed it. But 400 people were in combat
    positions that if it started to attack, that they would intervene. So as I fired and it moved away from the base, the
    other 400 kept their position. They remained on standby. And they saw that it moved up in the air, and the object moved
    away. So I chased it. I think it was 1,800 people who saw this very clearly.

    is pretty close to 10. Tell us on that scale where your countries are. Just a number.

  source_text: Well, I think that we have to distinguish between the recognition that the UFO phenomenon is real and the extraterrestrial
    hypothesis, because that's another step. So in the terms of the acceptance of UFOs as a real phenomenon, I mean, we have
    this statement from General Bermudez. Another important ufologist in Chile from the Army is Major Bravo, who was with
    the aviation branch of the Army. That would be a 0, a 1. They totally recognize that the UFO phenomenon is real. But the
    extraterrestrial hypothesis, that's another question, because then you would have to have a body or a piece of metal or
    something that really could be proven. So there, I don't know, they admit the possibility, but there I would say maybe
    a 6 or 7 as far as the ET part. But the UFO, total acceptance that it's a real phenomenon and that it may pose possibly
    a threat to aviation. And that is something that governments

  source_text: The vision of Uruguay from the point of view of the Uruguayan Air Force is people, I would say, 0. Because
    Uruguay, through its Air Force and UFO Investigation Commission, even welcomed the idea of extraterrestrials as a possibility.
    However, there are 40 cases, again, that we've been unable to resolve because of how odd they are. And you have civilian
    pilots, military pilots that have chased these UFOs and have taken photographs. So I would say the openness in Uruguay
    means that people have a good image of what the information we're providing is.

    do these investigations. I think people were very happy, and I think there was acceptance. Thank you very much.

    with them, and I profoundly admire the American people here as well. I want that to be very clear before I respond. What
    you're asking me is very complex, because at the moment when the Peruvian government decided to open this investigation
    office, they were admitting that there was a reality to this. They're not going to open an office on unicorns and ghosts.
    No, that's not what we're doing here. But on the other hand, this has been going on for 13 years, and we have seen minimal
    results. And when I talk to the military personnel, they say that they have seen UFOs, but they can't come out publicly
    and say because there is a policy that has not yet opened up. And so I would

    government is investigating the UFOs with scientifically correctness in this moment. And in the future, maybe it will
    be some pronunciation. That is it.
