    source_text: Because again, nobody makes fun of you or laughs at you. It's very
      normal now to talk about sightings, and that doesn't have any impact whatsoever
      on someone's career. And I'm very pleased that that's the case. In my experience
      with Argentina, I have three decades as a journalist, international, and I saw
      evolution. When I started, the media was more kind of, kind of, aseptic. It
      was hard to be interviewed. It was hard to kind of open this Pandora box of
      the subject. But I saw, all over the world, I've seen this changing. For example,
      with series of history channel, ancient aliens, or UFO hunters, the people is
      kind of totally more open. Today, for example, we are discovering planets similar
      to the Earth every day in the news. It's incredible how the astronomy and the
      exobiology is every day in your breakfast table in the newspaper. And that attitude
      also helped with the UFOs

      people were attacked.

      to me, and they said, "We would like to invite you to our country, because our
      country has accredited this encounter," and so when I reviewed the data in 1980,
      the only encounter with a UFO was my encounter, and so the date of this memorandum
      was about 28 days later, so there were no other occurrences at the same base,
      so I believe in the sharing of information, you can see that this was the event
      being referred to.

      Saucer was shut down. But just to add a few more pieces of information that
      it was only asked to say shut down to make pretend, because the Operation Saucer
      then became, in a second level, much more secret and was conducted for several
      more months under military, US military command in Brazilian territory.

      how were their morphology, how they function. And we know for a fact because
      this is a very well-documented case that has been investigated by at least 70

      such a damper by both the press and our government about believing this. I mean,
      you're sort of made fun of if you look at this and say, "Yes, this is real."
      What's the attitude of both the people and your press? We'll start with Mr.
      Gevaerd. Thank you. This is definitely not a matter of belief. There is a lot
      of data that has been produced by civilian UFO researchers, military UFO researchers,
      very few but very dedicated scientists for the last 60 years to confirm without
      any question at all that we are being visited by several species of more advanced,
      at least technologically, more advanced civilization that come here.

      to do, to question and to whatever we find out, take to the society, make the
      society know that we are being visited. Because we may very well, at any point,
      receive their visitation in an open and frank way. And the world has to be prepared
      for that. It's not out of question that one day we will change, exchange with
      them, we'll engage, we'll live with other societies from other planets.

    source_text: Antonio? Yes. You're asking about the social attitude of the public
      and the press in Latin America. I would say, in general, it is much more open
      than in the United States. Whenever there is an important UFO case, it gets
      covered in mainstream newspapers. So it would be like here being covered by
      the Washington Post, by the New York Times, but seriously, or at least semi-seriously.
      There is some ridicule, of course, but not as bad as the US. The scientific
      community, on the other hand, has been very conservative, generally speaking,
      in Latin America. I would say that there might be more scientists quietly doing
      research in the US than in Latin America. Although that is changing.

      after the Operation Saucer was shut down, this man called me and invited me
      to his place, to his house in Rio de Janeiro where he was living. And I spent
      two days with him, interviewing him extensively where he gave me full details
      of everything that happened during those four months. And he also described
      me how he and his men had a close encounter with the creatures that came in
      those objects. And that actually, this main encounter with an alien creature
      that took place in mid-December, 1977, was what caused the Operation Saucer
      to be shut down.

      an Air Force commission that also is accountable to the public on all issues
      dealing with UFOs. This commission also has military and civilian members, and
      also does have archives of 1300 cases that had been investigated, 3% of which,
      there are 39 or 40 cases now that have not been solved because of the level
      of bizarreness that they presented, and Uruguay has scientifically addressed
      the UFO issue and does not rule out the extraterrestrial element, but for this
      we do need scientific evidence. We do have cases, such as that which Colonel
      Santa Maria mentioned, and how fighter jets were scrambled to chase these objects,
      and how there was a chase, an in-air chase, and following glowing objects, and
      sometimes they would get close to, and how these objects would get close to
      air bases throughout Latin America.

    source_text: The main reason why the Operation Saucer was shut down was because
      there was an actual contact among the military, William Jolanda, the captain
      that was commanding the Operation Saucer, and an extraterrestrial creature.
      It took place on mid-December 1977. And as part of his duties, the commander
      of the Operation Saucer has to go back to his commander, a brigadier in the
      city of Belen, and report weekly what was going on during the Operation Saucer.
      And when he did that that week, then when he informed to his superior that he
      had an actual encounter with a creature, two arms, two legs, a body, a head,
      with a helmet that came from a UFO, 300 feet long, that almost landed close
      to the Guajará-Mirim River.

    source_text: Well, I think that we have to distinguish between the recognition
      that the UFO phenomenon is real and the extraterrestrial hypothesis, because
      that's another step. So in the terms of the acceptance of UFOs as a real phenomenon,
      I mean, we have this statement from General Bermudez. Another important ufologist
      in Chile from the Army is Major Bravo, who was with the aviation branch of the
      Army. That would be a 0, a 1. They totally recognize that the UFO phenomenon
      is real. But the extraterrestrial hypothesis, that's another question, because
      then you would have to have a body or a piece of metal or something that really
      could be proven. So there, I don't know, they admit the possibility, but there
      I would say maybe a 6 or 7 as far as the ET part. But the UFO, total acceptance

      Santa Maria mentioned, and how fighter jets were scrambled to chase these objects,

      It took place on mid-December 1977. And as part of his duties, the commander
      of the Operation Saucer has to go back to his commander, a brigadier in the
      city of Belen, and report weekly what was going on during the Operation Saucer.
      And when he did that that week, then when he informed to his superior that he
      had an actual encounter with a creature, two arms, two legs, a body, a head,

      There is some ridicule, of course, but not as bad as the US. The scientific

      in Chile from the Army is Major Bravo, who was with the aviation branch of the

      then you would have to have a body or a piece of metal or something that really
