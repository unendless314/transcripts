9. There is hardly any way to deny, unless you are all sitting here making up stories of how absolute your proof is of what's going on beyond our own earth, and so thank you for that.
→ {"text": "幾乎無可否認，除非在座各位都是在編造故事，否則你們的證據確實證明了地球之外發生的事情，因此非常感謝你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. My first question is to our wonderful pilot, Santa Maria.
→ {"text": "我的第一個問題要請教這位傑出的飛行員，聖瑪利亞上校。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. You're Peru, you're Argentina.
→ {"text": "您是秘魯代表，您是阿根廷代表。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. What I want to know is, do you have any kind of a formal relationship, your UFO group, with your Argentine government, and what is it, the Argentine government, and what is it, and how does it work, and what can we learn from that?
→ {"text": "我想知道的是，您的UFO團體與阿根廷政府之間是否有任何正式關係？這是什麼樣的關係？如何運作？我們能從中學到什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. Well, all the groups in Argentina, the civilian groups, created CEFORA, and CEFORA has united researchers for many, many years who were my colleagues and close associates.
→ {"text": "嗯，阿根廷所有的團體，民間團體，創立了CEFORA，而CEFORA多年來團結了許多研究人員，他們是我的同事和親近的夥伴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "CEFORA：阿根廷UFO現象研究委員會"}

15. Some of them were disciples of myself.
→ {"text": "其中一些人曾是我的門徒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. I started searching UFOs many years ago.
→ {"text": "我很多年前就開始研究UFO了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. We always look for the classification from the '70s to now.
→ {"text": "我們一直在尋求從70年代到現在的資料解密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. The group found the cooperation now of the Air Force through the Minister of Defense, and through the executive power of the nation, we are waiting to kind of unify that motion.
→ {"text": "該團體現在透過國防部長獲得了空軍的合作，並透過國家行政權力，我們正在等待統整這項動議。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

19. Now it's working also.
→ {"text": "現在這也在運作中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. We have a petition in the Congress of the nation, with executive power, and also with the Minister of Defense to have release documentations from the past.
→ {"text": "我們向國會提交了請願書，透過行政權力以及國防部長，要求解密過去的文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. They were projects, as I said in my speech, and maybe the translation was not so good.
→ {"text": "這些是專案，正如我在演說中提到的，也許當時的翻譯不是那麼好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. Of these projects and the projects, not only to release, also to have cooperation.
→ {"text": "關於這些專案，不僅是解密文件，還要有合作。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

24. To have cooperation with the field researchers, we always work alone with no mediums to get to the places to do good analysis.
→ {"text": "為了與田野研究人員合作，我們總是獨自工作，沒有媒介能前往現場進行良好的分析。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

25. We really, the groups kind of prevail so many decades with the lack of technical support to do analysis.
→ {"text": "我們這些團體確實在缺乏技術支援的情況下進行分析，已經持續了數十年。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

26. We have, for example, since the 2000, we have the phenomenon of, for example, of the cattle mutilations, which is very serious.
→ {"text": "例如，自2000年以來，我們遇到了牲畜肢解的現象，這非常嚴重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. We know through Linda Molton, her research.
→ {"text": "我們透過琳達·莫爾頓的研究了解到這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. Another example is the groups need support.
→ {"text": "另一個例子是這些團體需要支援。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. It's not only to have the classification of documents who could give light for scientific analysis and to see what happened also in documents and cases.
→ {"text": "這不僅是為了取得文件解密，讓科學分析能獲得啟發，也是為了從文件和案件中了解事情的真相。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

30. The Army forces and their force and the Navy research between 1960, as I explained, and today.
→ {"text": "正如我所說明的，陸軍部隊以及海軍從1960年到現在的研究。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

31. There were recent cases too, as I said in 2011, was this big explosion.
→ {"text": "最近也有案例，正如我所說的2011年那次大爆炸。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

32. You need the information.
→ {"text": "你們需要這些資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. Are they giving it to you or are you just helping them?
→ {"text": "是他們提供給你們，還是你們只是在協助他們？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. The classification started slowly.
→ {"text": "解密工作進展緩慢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. But it's actually happening.
→ {"text": "但這確實正在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. It's happening right now.
→ {"text": "現在就在進行中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. It's happening now.
→ {"text": "現在正在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. Thank you for sharing that with us.
→ {"text": "感謝您與我們分享這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. Colonel Santa Maria, I can't imagine your experience.
→ {"text": "聖瑪利亞上校，我無法想像您的經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. I mean, I felt like I was sitting on your shoulder when you were telling the story.
→ {"text": "我是說，當您講述這個故事時，我感覺就像坐在您肩上一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. Afterward, how did your government treat you?
→ {"text": "事後，您的政府如何對待您？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. Did they take your information and take it seriously?
→ {"text": "他們是否認真看待您提供的資訊？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. How could they not?
→ {"text": "他們怎麼可能不認真看待呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. And did you see any life in those UFOs?
→ {"text": "那麼您有在那些不明飛行物中看到生命跡象嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. We could not actually see into the UFO, not through the ceramic part or the metallic part.
→ {"text": "我們實際上看不進那個不明飛行物，無論是透過陶瓷部分還是金屬部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. As regards the government and the Air Force, the 1,800 people that actually saw it and the commanders that were there, we reported all of this to the Air Forces, but there was no negative repercussions because it was officially accepted.
→ {"text": "關於政府和空軍，當時有1800人親眼目睹，還有在場的指揮官，我們把這一切都報告給空軍，但沒有產生負面影響，因為這已被正式認可。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. The sighting was officially accepted, and I continued to fly for 20 more years without any problems.
→ {"text": "這次目擊事件被正式認可，我也繼續飛行了20年，沒有任何問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. So how did your press, did the press handle this, and I mean, what was their response?
→ {"text": "那麼媒體是如何處理這件事的？我是說，他們的反應是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. In 1980, when this event happened, this was a year that, on that air base, we were installing Soviet materials or Soviet installations at that place, and the UFO did not actually get to fly over the base.
→ {"text": "1980年這起事件發生時，在那座空軍基地，我們正在安裝蘇聯的設備或設施，而那個不明飛行物實際上並沒有飛越基地上空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. And so really, we received the order to not talk about this because we didn't actually want any好奇的記者來調查研究，因為基地上有敏感設備，我們不想引起不必要的注意。
→ {"text": "因此，我們收到了不要談論這件事的命令，因為我們不希望任何好奇的記者來調查，因為基地上有敏感設備，我們不想引起不必要的關注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. And so it was 22 years of silence until the Air Force officially gave us permission to talk about these phenomenon, and that's at that time when they said that we could actually start to speak publicly about this issue.
→ {"text": "因此，這沉默了22年，直到空軍正式允許我們談論這些現象，那時他們說我們可以開始公開談論這個議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. And as I said, they finally gave me the authorization to talk about this.
→ {"text": "正如我所說，他們最終授權我可以談論這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. And did the press come back by belittling the effort, or did they acknowledge it and support it?
→ {"text": "那麼媒體是否貶低這項努力，還是他們承認並支持它？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. The media started to talk about this secret that we had kept for so many years, but they didn't really know how to get access to the information from the Air Force offices, and so the media occasionally would interview me or request an interview just to try to get the word out about this, but it was so many years later that there wasn't a whole lot.
→ {"text": "媒體開始談論我們保守多年的這個秘密，但他們不知道如何從空軍辦公室取得資訊，因此媒體偶爾會採訪我或要求採訪，試圖傳播這個消息，但已經是多年後的事了，所以沒有引起太大關注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

59. Thank you very, very much.
→ {"text": "非常、非常感謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. Mr. Gevaerd.
→ {"text": "吉瓦德先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. Yes, ma'am.
→ {"text": "是的，女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. Can I take these off?
→ {"text": "我可以把這個拿下來嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. Yes.
→ {"text": "可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. Yeah, I'll be speaking in...
→ {"text": "好的，我會用……說話。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "指使用翻譯/母語"}

65. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. Yeah.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. And believe me, it's because I'm limited.
→ {"text": "請相信我，這是因為我的能力有限。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "指語言能力"}

69. You referred to American military in the Amazon.
→ {"text": "您提到了亞馬遜地區的美國軍隊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

70. How soon did that happen, and what's the relationship there?
→ {"text": "那是什麼時候發生的？雙方是什麼關係？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. The facts that I described happened in the '70s, in late '70s, in '77, and Brazil was, like many other countries in South America, under military dictatorship.
→ {"text": "我所描述的事實發生在70年代，1977年底，當時巴西與南美許多其他國家一樣，處於軍事獨裁政權統治之下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

72. And during that period of time, U.S. military and intelligence were all over South America, ruling lots of things there.
→ {"text": "在那段時期，美國軍隊和情報人員遍布南美洲，掌控著許多事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. Now, when Operation Saucer took place, and it happened because the populations of the affected area couldn't live anymore because they were seeing UFOs all the time, and worse than that, they were being attacked, over 1,000 people were attacked.
→ {"text": "當飛碟行動展開時，那是因為受影響地區的居民已經無法正常生活，他們一直看到不明飛行物，更糟的是，他們遭到攻擊，超過1000人受到攻擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. During a certain period of time, there were lots of injuries made by this object that would come from the sky and emit a beam of light towards people's body, making them faint and become anemic.
→ {"text": "在某段時間內，許多人被這個從天而降的物體所傷，它會向人們的身體發射光束，使他們昏厥並變得貧血。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. Now, the situation went so intense that the community leaders went to the governor of the state of Pará to ask that something is done about it.
→ {"text": "情況變得如此嚴重，以至於社區領袖前往帕拉州州長那裡，要求採取行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. And the government asked the Brazilian Air Force to start an investigation to give answers to the population, to the society.
→ {"text": "政府要求巴西空軍展開調查，向民眾和社會提供答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. Then it was established, Operation Saucer, to investigate and to engage the extraterrestrial intelligences because there was already, and this is in the documents, there was already a knowledge that there was an intelligence beyond that phenomena, and that phenomena was not earthly.
→ {"text": "於是成立了飛碟行動，目的是調查並與外星智慧生命接觸，因為已經有——文件中也記載了——已有證據表明那種現象背後存在智慧，而且那種現象並非來自地球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. Now, when Operation Saucer started as a military operation with all the military system and style, during its procedures that lasted four months, and the way it was closed is very interesting.
→ {"text": "當飛碟行動以軍事行動的形式展開，具備所有軍事系統和風格，在其持續四個月的程序中，而它結束的方式非常有趣。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

79. But during these four months, U.S. military, U.S. intelligence were visiting those areas and taking part of the operations during the Operation Saucer.
→ {"text": "但在這四個月期間，美國軍隊和情報人員造訪了那些地區，並參與了飛碟行動期間的行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. And they were talking to the witnesses during the day and sky watching the night with full equipment to try to detect and film the UFOs that were being seen.
→ {"text": "他們白天與證人交談，夜間則帶著全套設備進行天空監測，試圖探測並拍攝那些被看到的不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. Now, it was said to me by the commander of the Operation Saucer that at the beginning, in the first weeks, only a few sightings took place.
→ {"text": "飛碟行動的指揮官告訴我，在行動初期，最初幾週只發生了少數幾次目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. But after the Operation Saucer went on and on, the objects would come more and more boldly into the direction of the areas where the military were camping.
→ {"text": "但隨著飛碟行動持續進行，這些物體越來越大膽地朝軍方紮營的區域靠近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. So was the U.S. military part of that Saucer project with you?
→ {"text": "那麼美國軍方是否與你們一起參與了飛碟行動？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. Not officially.
→ {"text": "非官方層面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. Were they at the table?
→ {"text": "他們有參與決策嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

86. Not officially.
→ {"text": "非官方層面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. They took part in lots of procedures, including this was told to me by the commander of the Operation Saucer himself, Colonel Uyrangê Hollanda, that they were having problem in documenting the UFOs with photograph.
→ {"text": "他們參與了許多行動，包括飛碟行動指揮官烏伊蘭吉·霍蘭達上校親自告訴我的，他們在用照片記錄不明飛行物時遇到了困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. Some UFOs were hard to photograph.
→ {"text": "有些不明飛行物很難拍攝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. But they solved this problem when the U.S. military came to Brazil and gave to the Brazilian military some equipment and highly sensitive films so they can not only photograph the UFOs, over 500 pictures were made, and also film the UFOs, 16 hours of film were made of including motherships over the Amazon River.
→ {"text": "但當美國軍方來到巴西，向巴西軍方提供了一些設備和高感光度底片後，這個問題就解決了，因此他們不僅拍攝了不明飛行物的照片，拍攝了超過500張照片，還拍攝了影片，總共16小時的影片，包括亞馬遜河上的母船。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. So do you have any idea of whether or not that information and those films were shared here in the United States?
→ {"text": "那麼您是否知道這些資訊和影片是否被分享到了美國？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. I don't have that information.
→ {"text": "我沒有這方面的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. I truly believe that.
→ {"text": "我由衷地相信這一點。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

93. Would it have been all right?
→ {"text": "這樣可以嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

94. Was there some embargo in their relationship with you that would say you can't take our information back?
→ {"text": "他們與你們的關係中是否存在某種禁令，規定你們不能帶走我們的資訊？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. No, I think that the whole thing about the cooperation with the Americans is that they take the information back to the United States.
→ {"text": "不，我認為與美國人合作的整個重點就在於，他們會把資訊帶回美國。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. They were there to collect information as they were in Argentina and Chile and so many countries to get information about the dust phenomena and bring back to the United States to use for their own purposes.
→ {"text": "他們在那裡收集資訊，就像他們在阿根廷、智利和許多其他國家一樣，以獲取關於這種塵埃現象的資訊，並將其帶回美國用於他們自己的目的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. Well, thank you very much.
→ {"text": "好的，非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. So Mr. Huneeus, you mentioned that the traffic control group was housed in the Air and Space Museum.
→ {"text": "那麼胡紐斯先生，您提到空中交通管制的團隊設在航空太空博物館。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. Currently.
→ {"text": "目前是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

102. But it started out in another...
→ {"text": "但它最初設在另一個……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. Yes, the Technical School of Aeronautics.
→ {"text": "是的，航空技術學校。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. That was the office initially.
→ {"text": "那是最初的辦公室。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. Well, when you told us that it had been taken from one area to another, when I heard museum, I got a little concerned that it was saying this is all past and you're not going to be working on the future.
→ {"text": "嗯，當您告訴我們它從一個地方搬到另一個地方時，當我聽到博物館時，我有點擔心這意味著這一切都已成過去，你們將不會再致力於未來的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. It's not in the museum itself, it's in the museum of the Aeronautics, it's in an old airport.
→ {"text": "它不在博物館本身，而是在航空博物館，位於一個舊機場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

107. It used to be the main airport, Los Cerrillos, but what happened like it happened in many cities is the city grew too much and also was done when the runways were smaller.
→ {"text": "它曾經是主要機場，洛斯塞里洛斯機場，但就像許多城市發生的情況一樣，城市擴張得太大了，而且當時的跑道也比較小。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

108. So eventually the airport, Los Cerrillos, is no longer functioning as an airport, but they're still using the hangars and things and they created a museum.
→ {"text": "因此，洛斯塞里洛斯機場最終不再作為機場運作，但他們仍在使用機庫等設施，並在那裡創建了一個博物館。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

109. But the facilities of the committee, the CEFAA, are annexed, but it has nothing to do with the museum.
→ {"text": "但委員會的設施，也就是CEFAA，是附設的，與博物館沒有關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. So it worked for convenience, it worked for you.
→ {"text": "所以這樣做是為了方便，對你們來說是可行的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

112. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. They also have an office at the main headquarters of the Civil Aviation Agency, but according to what General Bermudez told me, they'd rather be at that other place, he said, because when they are in the headquarters, if they have to make an official presentation or something, of course they can use that facility, he said, everybody's asking them questions.
→ {"text": "他們在智利民航局總部也設有辦公室，但根據貝爾穆德斯將軍告訴我的，他們寧願待在另一個地方，他說，因為當他們在總部時，如果他們必須進行官方簡報之類的，當然他們可以使用那個設施，他說，每個人都會問他們問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. "Oh, what's going on with UFOs?
→ {"text": "「哦，不明飛行物有什麼新進展？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. Have you seen any?"
→ {"text": "你們有看到什麼嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. So he said, "We're in the other place, nobody bothers them.
→ {"text": "所以他說，「我們在另一個地方，沒有人會打擾他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. They can work quietly and do their job."
→ {"text": "他們可以安靜地工作，專心做他們的任務。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

119. I thank you and I thank you all.
→ {"text": "我感謝您，也感謝你們所有人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. My time is up.
→ {"text": "我的時間到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
