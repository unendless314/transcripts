## Speaker Group 1

1. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

2. This meeting will come back to order.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

3. I am going to start out to my right with Congresswoman Woolsey, and this will be the time to ask questions of our witness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

4. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

5. What a morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

6. What a morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

7. Good morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

8. What a morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. There is hardly any way to deny, unless you are all sitting here making up stories of how absolute your proof is of what's going on beyond our own earth, and so thank you for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. That was good for all of us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. My first question is to our wonderful pilot, Santa Maria.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. You're Peru, you're Argentina.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. What I want to know is, do you have any kind of a formal relationship, your UFO group, with your Argentine government, and what is it, the Argentine government, and what is it, and how does it work, and what can we learn from that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. Well, all the groups in Argentina, the civilian groups, created CEFORA, and CEFORA has united researchers for many, many years who were my colleagues and close associates.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. Some of them were disciples of myself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. I started searching UFOs many years ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. We always look for the classification from the '70s to now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. The group found the cooperation now of the Air Force through the Minister of Defense, and through the executive power of the nation, we are waiting to kind of unify that motion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. Now it's working also.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. We have a petition in the Congress of the nation, with executive power, and also with the Minister of Defense to have release documentations from the past.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. They were projects, as I said in my speech, and maybe the translation was not so good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. Of these projects and the projects, not only to release, also to have cooperation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. To have cooperation with the field researchers, we always work alone with no mediums to get to the places to do good analysis.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. We really, the groups kind of prevail so many decades with the lack of technical support to do analysis.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. We have, for example, since the 2000, we have the phenomenon of, for example, of the cattle mutilations, which is very serious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. We know through Linda Molton, her research.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. Another example is the groups need support.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. It's not only to have the classification of documents who could give light for scientific analysis and to see what happened also in documents and cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. The Army forces and their force and the Navy research between 1960, as I explained, and today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. There were recent cases too, as I said in 2011, was this big explosion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. You need the information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. Are they giving it to you or are you just helping them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. The classification started slowly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. But it's actually happening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. It's happening right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. It's happening now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. Thank you for sharing that with us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. Colonel Santa Maria, I can't imagine your experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. I mean, I felt like I was sitting on your shoulder when you were telling the story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. Afterward, how did your government treat you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. Did they take your information and take it seriously?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. How could they not?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. And did you see any life in those UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. We could not actually see into the UFO, not through the ceramic part or the metallic part.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. As regards the government and the Air Force, the 1,800 people that actually saw it and the commanders that were there, we reported all of this to the Air Forces, but there was no negative repercussions because it was officially accepted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. The sighting was officially accepted, and I continued to fly for 20 more years without any problems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. So how did your press, did the press handle this, and I mean, what was their response?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. In 1980, when this event happened, this was a year that, on that air base, we were installing Soviet materials or Soviet installations at that place, and the UFO did not actually get to fly over the base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. And so really, we received the order to not talk about this because we didn't actually want any curious journalists to come and actually research and investigate this because we had sensitive materials on the base, and we didn't want to attract any undue attention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. And so it was 22 years of silence until the Air Force officially gave us permission to talk about these phenomenon, and that's at that time when they said that we could actually start to speak publicly about this issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. And as I said, they finally gave me the authorization to talk about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. And did the press come back by belittling the effort, or did they acknowledge it and support it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. The media started to talk about this secret that we had kept for so many years, but they didn't really know how to get access to the information from the Air Force offices, and so the media occasionally would interview me or request an interview just to try to get the word out about this, but it was so many years later that there wasn't a whole lot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. Thank you very, very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. Mr. Gevaerd.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. Yes, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. Can I take these off?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. Yeah, I'll be speaking in...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. And believe me, it's because I'm limited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. You referred to American military in the Amazon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. How soon did that happen, and what's the relationship there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. The facts that I described happened in the '70s, in late '70s, in '77, and Brazil was, like many other countries in South America, under military dictatorship.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. And during that period of time, U.S. military and intelligence were all over South America, ruling lots of things there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. Now, when Operation Saucer took place, and it happened because the populations of the affected area couldn't live anymore because they were seeing UFOs all the time, and worse than that, they were being attacked, over 1,000 people were attacked.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. During a certain period of time, there were lots of injuries made by this object that would come from the sky and emit a beam of light towards people's body, making them faint and become anemic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. Now, the situation went so intense that the community leaders went to the governor of the state of Pará to ask that something is done about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. And the government asked the Brazilian Air Force to start an investigation to give answers to the population, to the society.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. Then it was established, Operation Saucer, to investigate and to engage the extraterrestrial intelligences because there was already, and this is in the documents, there was already a knowledge that there was an intelligence beyond that phenomena, and that phenomena was not earthly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. Now, when Operation Saucer started as a military operation with all the military system and style, during its procedures that lasted four months, and the way it was closed is very interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. But during these four months, U.S. military, U.S. intelligence were visiting those areas and taking part of the operations during the Operation Saucer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. And they were talking to the witnesses during the day and sky watching the night with full equipment to try to detect and film the UFOs that were being seen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. Now, it was said to me by the commander of the Operation Saucer that at the beginning, in the first weeks, only a few sightings took place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. But after the Operation Saucer went on and on, the objects would come more and more boldly into the direction of the areas where the military were camping.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. So was the U.S. military part of that Saucer project with you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. Not officially.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. Were they at the table?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. Not officially.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. They took part in lots of procedures, including this was told to me by the commander of the Operation Saucer himself, Colonel Uyrangê Hollanda, that they were having problem in documenting the UFOs with photograph.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. Some UFOs were hard to photograph.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. But they solved this problem when the U.S. military came to Brazil and gave to the Brazilian military some equipment and highly sensitive films so they can not only photograph the UFOs, over 500 pictures were made, and also film the UFOs, 16 hours of film were made of including motherships over the Amazon River.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. So do you have any idea of whether or not that information and those films were shared here in the United States?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. I don't have that information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. I truly believe that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. Would it have been all right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. Was there some embargo in their relationship with you that would say you can't take our information back?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. No, I think that the whole thing about the cooperation with the Americans is that they take the information back to the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. They were there to collect information as they were in Argentina and Chile and so many countries to get information about the dust phenomena and bring back to the United States to use for their own purposes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. Well, thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. So Mr. Huneeus, you mentioned that the traffic control group was housed in the Air and Space Museum.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. Currently.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. But it started out in another...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. Yes, the Technical School of Aeronautics.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. That was the office initially.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. Well, when you told us that it had been taken from one area to another, when I heard museum, I got a little concerned that it was saying this is all past and you're not going to be working on the future.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. It's not in the museum itself, it's in the museum of the Aeronautics, it's in an old airport.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. It used to be the main airport, Los Cerrillos, but what happened like it happened in many cities is the city grew too much and also was done when the runways were smaller.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. So eventually the airport, Los Cerrillos, is no longer functioning as an airport, but they're still using the hangars and things and they created a museum.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. But the facilities of the committee, the CEFAA, are annexed, but it has nothing to do with the museum.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. So it worked for convenience, it worked for you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. They also have an office at the main headquarters of the Civil Aviation Agency, but according to what General Bermudez told me, they'd rather be at that other place, he said, because when they are in the headquarters, if they have to make an official presentation or something, of course they can use that facility, he said, everybody's asking them questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. "Oh, what's going on with UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. Have you seen any?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. So he said, "We're in the other place, nobody bothers them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. They can work quietly and do their job."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. I thank you and I thank you all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. My time is up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
