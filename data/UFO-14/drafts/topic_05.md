405. Thank you very much. And with that, we will go to Representative Bartlett.

406. Thank you very much. First, I want to apologize for my tardiness. This is National Day of Prayer in the United States. And for a long time, I had been scheduled to be the main speaker at a countywide National Day of Prayer breakfast this morning. And so I fulfilled that obligation and came here so soon as I could. We have your testimony then. Thank you all very, very much.

407. While our military and our government is saying that there's no such thing as a possibility of a UFO coming from another world, they of course admit that there are UFOs. UFO simply means unidentified flying object. And the Air Force says that in their Project Blue Book there were 701 of them that they couldn't wish away some way or another. So they do admit they're unidentified flying objects. They simply are denying categorically, I think, that they could be of extraterrestrial origin. But while they seem to poo-poo the whole thing here and relegate it to the ha-ha corner, they apparently are aggressive in participating in investigations of USO sightings in South America. And I'd just like to start here with Mr. Gavard and go down the table and have you tell each of us briefly, is this true in your country and to what extent?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. Yes, it is. Actually, I'd like to take this opportunity to speak about crashes. It has been said here in this table and during the preceding years and days that crashes of UFOs have happened, most of them in old days. But there is at least one recent crash and it took place in Brazil in 1996. It is called the Varginha case in which an alien spacecraft crashed and at least two creatures were captured and offered no resistance to its capture.

409. But they died right after they were captured. And this procedure were taken of rescuing the debris of the UFO and capturing the creatures were taken both by the fire department of the city of Virginia with the army personnel of a nearby headquarter. And in the next day, the following day of the capture, we already knew that US intelligence and US military as well as US doctors were sent by the US consulate in Sao Paulo to the city of Virginia to follow the procedures. The doctors were sent, medical doctors from United States, to follow what was being done about the creatures because they died and nobody could explain how were their morphology, how they function. And we know for a fact because this is a very well-documented case that has been investigated by at least 70 UFO researchers, including first UFO researchers from United States as Dr. Roger Leir, Dr. J.J. Hur-tak, and the

410. deceased Dr. John Mack from Harvard University. They have been to Brazil, they confirmed what the UFO researchers from Brazil discovered. And we know for a fact that at least one of those two creatures were taken to United States by US military. And it was taken in one of the Buffalo airplanes to serve the US embassies and consulates in South America. When it came back to United States, it brought back to here one of the creatures and part of the object that were rescued, that were retrieved by the Brazilian military.

411. Yes. Well, in Chile, I don't have really much information about the other than what I said earlier, that there were some documents from the CIA, but they tend to be old. But I do want to bring up a case that was mentioned by my colleague, Johnetti, which happened in Bolivia. And we don't have anybody from Bolivia here, so I'll speak briefly about that case because I'm familiar with. And it's a crash too that took place in Tarija, which is on the border of Bolivia and Argentina in May of 1978. In this case, we do have some documents, not Majestic 12 type documents, which are controversial, but these are officially released documents under the Freedom of Information Act, including a telex from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance at the time. And also Air Force officers from the Defense Attaché Office under a project that was called Project Moon Dust, which is well established that existed,

412. which was for the recovery of space objects. I mean, that's how they started. As soon as the space age took off in 1957, then the Air Force created this project, Moon Dust, for the recovery of space debris. But according to one document, they list space debris, and in those days only two countries had space projects. That was the United States and the Soviet Union. And then it says unidentified flying objects in the same document. So when this incident happened, two officers from the Defense Attaché Office, which were stationed in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, somehow showed up in this remote area. And unfortunately for them, as they were coming in the airport, they were photographed by a local reporter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. And the picture, you can see them, they're trying to hide their faces, but there they were. They were photographed, and the picture was published in the press. So the cover story is that they were on vacation. But that's not a type of city you go on vacation, number one. They were not with their wives. So obviously that was a cover story and a pretty bad one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. Nevertheless, this was in a very remote area. We only have probably a very partial file from the US. There's only a few documents. I'm sure there's plenty more. Where the case gets a little murky is as to whether something was really retrieved and taken back to the US, or it may still be there, because it was in an extremely remote area, and there had been like a landslide on a mountain. There was an expedition initially by the army, by the Bolivian army, under a lieutenant, and they finally got to the area, but they didn't have the equipment and the facilities to do something. And there are some rumors that something was retrieved and taken to the United States, but then according to an American reporter who did investigate this case, whose name was Bob Pratt, he's now deceased, he thinks that they never did retrieve, because it was such a remote area, so that object

415. might still be there. But again, it shows that there is an interest on the part of the United States, and we have uncovered some documents, but there's probably much more.

416. Thank you. Colonel Sanchez.

417. In the Uruguayan case, as regards to UFO investigation, there is no official exchange with the United States. The only exchanges that we have had with the United States have been the recovery in 2011 of a star engine, Delta II, which fell over our airspace. I personally went to recover that object. But as regards to UFO issues, we have no exchange agreement with them, nor have we carried out any official exchange with them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. Dr. Troy. In the case of my country, I understand that this takes place at two levels. The public level, in which the Air Force Office is in charge of this, and through the public relations. But I understand that at another level, there is an official exchange of information. And this is a constant exchange of information we can see, because afterwards, we can see the information does make it to the United States when there are UFO crashes. For example, in the case that we mentioned before, the San Mato de Huancho in 1980, unfortunately, there are no official documents. Everything is at a secret level, but we have received many testimonies on exchange of information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. Colonel Santa Maria. Comments, please, on any participation of our either intelligence or military, any other part of our government, in investigations of UFOs in your country. I'm not aware of any official U.S. involvement on the UFO issue, but we do know that in the intelligence exchange, there is an exchange of information between the intelligence agencies. Anytime there's a new event, there is an exchange of information to update the intelligence communities on these issues.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. Ms. Simondini. Yes, regarding as I explained to the senator, in matter of ufology on research, I'm not aware of any documentation exchange between Argentina and United States. But regarding to other agencies, as NASA, well, NASA has in several cases of Argentina is a place where there's a lot of space junk. There's a lot of debris satellites coming from international, also other countries. And I researched many cases where many debris is coming, but different kind of procedures.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. And in the case of NASA, yes, they asked for particular cases if they were part of American missions. And there was a few cases of retrieval, yes. But we were talking about only space debris. Oh, thank you. It's very interesting that there's apparently a different attitude on their part if it's outside this country. The inner country is total denial. But if they really believe that, then they wouldn't be participating in these investigations in South America.

422. Mr. Gimini, you mentioned that Operation Saucer was shut down. Is that simply because it then went underground, then went secret? They continued the investigation, but secret now?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. The main reason why the Operation Saucer was shut down was because there was an actual contact among the military, William Jolanda, the captain that was commanding the Operation Saucer, and an extraterrestrial creature. It took place on mid-December 1977. And as part of his duties, the commander of the Operation Saucer has to go back to his commander, a brigadier in the city of Belen, and report weekly what was going on during the Operation Saucer. And when he did that that week, then when he informed to his superior that he had an actual encounter with a creature, two arms, two legs, a body, a head, with a helmet that came from a UFO, 300 feet long, that almost landed close to the Guajará-Mirim River.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. When we reported that to the brigadier, Protasso de Oliveira, his commander, then William Jolanda was given order to shut down Operation Saucer and return all material and bring all his men from the jungle to the city and give it all the material, all the information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. Then we realized, we knew, I've been seeking information about it for quite 20, 20-some years. I have gathered lots of information about it in my, in my pursuit for the details of this, that the Operation Saucer changed its name, changed its personnel. All the three dozen men that were commanded by William Jolanda were taken off the scene, and the new personnel took the operation under a different name and under U.S. military command from several months after December 1977.

426. Oh, thank you. One quick question to Colonel Santa Maria. What would be the- You have less than one minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. Less than one minute. I saw that. Thank you. I saw that. What would be the arguments for and against the suggestion that what you were dealing with was kind of like a giant hologram rather than something physical? Your bullets had no effect on it. I'm just asking, you know, if that was the argument, that could it have been a kind of a giant hologram, what would be the arguments for that? What would be the arguments against that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. Well, it would be difficult for it to be a hologram because I saw it from different angles, and when it moved, a hologram could change, it could change shape, but the colors were very solid. It was a real object. This was not a hologram.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. It was an object that we can't understand if, in fact, there was no effect of bullets on it. I'm just curious. We're dealing with a phenomenon here that we cannot explain in terms of our physics and so forth here. I'm just wondering what the various options are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. Thank you all very much. Or if we can have a second round to answer additional questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. We will probably have a very short round. Okay, thank you. Yes. One question per person, however. Thank you very much for being here today. Great testimony.
