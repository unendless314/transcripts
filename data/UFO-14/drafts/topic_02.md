## Speaker Group 1

122. Next up we have, next up we have Ms. Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. I wasn't going to start with you, Mr. Gevaerd, but I think I will.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. I think you're the first that I've heard in four days who said the presence of the others actually attacked people that caused the Operation Saucer project to come into existence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. Is that right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. That's right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. I don't think I've heard that before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. Certainly haven't heard it in America.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. Matter of fact, it probably happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. Doesn't mean it didn't happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. We just haven't heard it reported like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. What year did Operation Saucer start?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. I'm sorry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. What year?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. Oh, it started in September 1977.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. And how long did it end?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. And it ended on December 1977.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. It took four months only.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. And you also mentioned in this, from Congresswoman Woolsey, the U.S., did you say they took your information and you were waiting to hear back from them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. Or something you were saying about, I don't know, maybe you supplied the information from Brazil in this instance, and then they were to report back or something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. What was your relationship with the United States of America?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. And this is for all of you all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. The information on your presence, your UFOs, your whatever that's being called, what relationship, if any, did you have with the U.S. government?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. And did you forward or share any information from your country with the U.S. government?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. Me personally?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. No, Brazil.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. Oh, Brazil, of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. Brazil.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. All of it for your country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. I mean, for your country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. Yes, there is a common sense that the U.S. government is acting in many places of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. Is what?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. Is working, operating in many places of the world collecting information about this subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. It is reported that the U.S. military have been to several countries collecting information about UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. Now, we just saw when Commander Santa Maria presented his case, a document that shows that U.S. intelligence was getting formed of what happened in La Joya Air Force Base in Peru.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. The same thing happened in Brazil.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. In many years, we have had U.S. military coming down to Brazil and taking part of investigations of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. And it's not only in the past, like four, five decades ago, but also in recent cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. Okay, stop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. That's it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. So, can each of you respond to that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. We'll go right down the line.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. I just want to know what relationship, if any, does U.S. have with your experiences and your acts of what we're discussing this week?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. I mean, do you automatically give it to them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. Is it because we have military bases there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. Is it because we may get appropriations from us that you must share this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. What reason and what is that connection?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. In the case of the CFAA, in fact, General Bermudez told me that when they created the office back in the late '90s, they contacted the American government, I guess through the embassy because they wanted to have some kind of formal relationship, but there was no response.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. They did not respond.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. What year was that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. That would have been probably late '90s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. But they do have an agreement with not an official group, but it's called NARCAP.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. I think it stands for National Aviation Research Center for Anomalous Phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. Located where?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. Well, it's run by a former NASA scientist, a very serious man called Dr. Richard Haynes, and he is an expert on aviation cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. He's a long-time NASA scientist, very serious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. So he's lectured, he's gone to Chile.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. They have very close relationship because he's an expert on aviation cases and the CFAA is run by the Civil Aviation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. But NARCAP is not an official agency of the U.S. government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. That sounds like a non-profit of some sort, and we've had some testimony here to that effect on our U.S. side that would probably equal that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. So the other thing is what my colleague Javier was mentioning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. If you study the American declassified UFO files, which are extensive, you will see a tremendous amount of documents, especially back in the old days, but there's still some more recent collected by various agencies, usually through the Defense Attaché Office or sometimes by the CIA, and it's obviously that these people are monitoring the international aspect of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. And do you get, does Peru get information back from the U.S. regarding any of what you send them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. Well, I cannot speak for Peru.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. In the case of Chile, there might be some at the level of intelligence, they probably do, but then that is not revealed publicly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. You see, what General Bermúdez wanted was to have a formal, but because of the transparency law that would have had to be revealed publicly, so the U.S. just never responded.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. It's Brazil, Chile.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. Colonel Sanchez, could you respond?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. Do you share any of your information, as you testified to us this morning, with U.S. or any non-profit or other entity that may not be government?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. Do you share any of that with the U.S. government or a non-profit or an agency here in our country that would know what your gay has experienced?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. No, not with any civilian or military agency or U.S. government agency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. There is no sharing or exchange of information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. Doctor, I want to say Choi, is that right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. Well, the truth is, one of the conclusions you can draw after having heard the testimony of all the witnesses is that the UFO phenomenon is one of national security, and therefore the intelligence element is extremely important.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. As far as we understand, in Peru there is no open, formal public agreement, but there are indications that show that some of this information is shared with U.S. security agencies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. There's no open public document, but there are witnesses who have noted that in the '80s, apparently a UFO fell in the San Mateo de Huancho area, and they said that there were Americans who were in that area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. And I do want to remind you that in the Greer Disclosure Project, there were people who made statements, gave testimony, that stated that there was a U.S. Sergeant Jonathan Weygandt who said that a UFO had crashed in northern Peru, and that there was extraction, and this was according to testimony, that they took some of the remains of this falling UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. They were taken away by helicopters that were definitively not part of the Peruvian Armed Forces.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. Excuse me?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. They were not part of Peru, taken away in helicopters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. What country was that who took them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. Based on the testimony from the Steven Greer Project, apparently they were American helicopters, and that these materials were taken back to the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. I'm going to change for Colonel Santa Maria.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. You're a brave man to go up and down, back and forth, zip, zip, with something you don't know what it is, and you're trying to shoot it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. That's pretty brave.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. I'm going to commend you for all of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. You did get away clean and free and healthy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. That's a good thing, and thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. I'm not sure I want to ask you that same question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. I do want to go to Argentina and ask the same question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. Do you, Argentina, share either with government or non-government organizations any of your experience, any of the things that you've witnessed to us today with the United States of America, either through its government or other non-profits or unaffiliated?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. Pretty sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. I am sure there's some kind of no open communication, but it's possible, but officially I don't see any kind of document or interaction between Argentina government and US agencies, yeah, officially.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. But, regarding we were talking, also was very interesting case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. I researched in the decade of '70, '78, there was a UFO crash between Argentina and Bolivia, and supporting what Dr. Choi said was an object who produced a kind of destruction of a hill, was a kind of a cycle shape, a structure of no identified, and the Bolivian government in the study, the Argentinian was a limit, didn't investigate, but that object was retrieved by American's helicopters too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. Oh, stop, stop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. You have no relationship with them, but in that instance, and other instances around the table, we have been on the scene at some of your current experiences.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. Right, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. It goes back, I want to go back to Dr. Choi for just a moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. Your point was well made in terms of national security, so do you all in South America share your information and experiences and enhance or whatever your national security is, because of what you see and how closely you live together, and just one person, and you know, I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. There is an agreement at the level of military in our South America, they share information about a wide variety of subjects, of items, and the UFO is one of them, it has been confirmed by top ranking military in Brazil and in other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. It means, and the military level, which is, it's independent than the politics that is a strong.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. Did you say independent of politics?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. Of politics, because presidents can come and go, but the military stay, and as they stay, they have to have a channel of communication among themselves, so they can talk about interests of each other, that applies in this country too, we just don't acknowledge it as such, it does.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. Presidents change, but the military industrial complex is alive and well, and continues so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. Right, I'd like to add that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. Just a minute, one last question, I've got one minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. So therefore, South America, I believe this is an international issue, and that we ought to go back to our congresses and others, but I also think we ought to have UN presence, and there's been some.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. Will your countries help the citizens hearing on disclosure go to the UN to ask for their help in this subject, and will your countries help petition us with that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. Yes, of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. It's what we want.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. We would like.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. You didn't say it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. You didn't say it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. I want to hear it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. Okay, that's good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. No, no, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. I think that's good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

253. That's what we want to hear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. Because these official agencies, they want a place where their data can be shared officially with other countries, because the UFO phenomenon, by definition, is global.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. Like I said, they don't care about national boundaries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. That's our problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

258. They care about national security, though, and technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. So I mean, it's got to be a way to do it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. I think a new opinion may know better, and so certainly more people in this room know better than I.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. Well, that is the problem, because as you know, and in Congress, I'm sure you've dealt with many issues dealing with intelligence and national security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. There's all kinds of things going on under the rug, you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. I mean, informally, intelligence agencies, they have their own procedures, but those are not made public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. Okay, stop, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. The United States of America knows of your instances.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. You all said that, most of you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. They don't tell us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. They know yours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. And then they make mockery of us, and that doesn't exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. Well, because the U.S. government doesn't acknowledge.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. Okay, my time is out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. I yield.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. I yield.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. I yield back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. I know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. But we've got to get to what we've got to get to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. I want you all to know, and I commend you for all that you do and that you work together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. But if our military gets your information and does whatever it does with it, and I hope to make a better world and a better global presence so that we all might live the next 50 years, that we also work together to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. I'm not so sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. Some work with you and some don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. We've got to open it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. We've got to address it, or there will be no universe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. You all understand?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. Thank you, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. Representative Cook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
