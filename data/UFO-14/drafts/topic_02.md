125. I think you're the first that I've heard in four days who said the presence of the others actually attacked people that caused the Operation Saucer project to come into existence.
→ {"text": "我想您是這四天來我聽到的第一位說，那些存在的攻擊行為導致了飛碟行動計畫的誕生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. Is that right?

127. That's right.

128. I don't think I've heard that before.

129. Certainly haven't heard it in America.
→ {"text": "在美國肯定沒聽說過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. Matter of fact, it probably happened.
→ {"text": "事實上，這很可能發生過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. Doesn't mean it didn't happen.
→ {"text": "這不代表它沒發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. We just haven't heard it reported like that.
→ {"text": "我們只是沒聽過這樣的報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

141. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. And you also mentioned in this, from Congresswoman Woolsey, the U.S., did you say they took your information and you were waiting to hear back from them?
→ {"text": "您還提到了，從伍爾西議員那裡關於美國的部分，您是說他們拿走了您的資訊，而您正在等待他們回覆嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. Or something you were saying about, I don't know, maybe you supplied the information from Brazil in this instance, and then they were to report back or something.
→ {"text": "或者您在說些什麼，我不知道，也許您提供了來自巴西的資訊，然後他們應該回報之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. I don't know.
→ {"text": "我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. What was your relationship with the United States of America?
→ {"text": "您與美利堅合眾國的關係是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. And this is for all of you all.
→ {"text": "這是給你們所有人的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. The information on your presence, your UFOs, your whatever that's being called, what relationship, if any, did you have with the U.S. government?
→ {"text": "關於你們的存在、你們的不明飛行物，或隨便你們怎麼稱呼它，你們與美國政府有什麼關係，如果有的話？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. And did you forward or share any information from your country with the U.S. government?
→ {"text": "你們是否將貴國的任何資訊轉交或分享給美國政府？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. Me personally?
→ {"text": "我個人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. No, Brazil.
→ {"text": "不，是巴西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. Oh, Brazil, of course.
→ {"text": "哦，巴西，當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. Brazil.
→ {"text": "巴西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. All of it for your country.
→ {"text": "全部都是關於貴國的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. I mean, for your country.
→ {"text": "我是說，關於貴國的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. Yes, there is a common sense that the U.S. government is acting in many places of the world.
→ {"text": "是的，有一種普遍的認知是，美國政府在世界各地活動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

156. Is what?
→ {"text": "是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. Is working, operating in many places of the world collecting information about this subject.
→ {"text": "在世界各地運作，收集關於這個主題的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. It is reported that the U.S. military have been to several countries collecting information about UFOs.
→ {"text": "據報導，美國軍方曾前往多個國家收集關於不明飛行物的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. Now, we just saw when Commander Santa Maria presented his case, a document that shows that U.S. intelligence was getting formed of what happened in La Joya Air Force Base in Peru.
→ {"text": "我們剛才看到，當聖瑪利亞指揮官提出他的案子時，有一份文件顯示美國情報機構正在了解發生在秘魯拉霍亞空軍基地的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. The same thing happened in Brazil.
→ {"text": "同樣的事情也發生在巴西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. In many years, we have had U.S. military coming down to Brazil and taking part of investigations of UFOs.
→ {"text": "多年來，我們一直有美國軍方來到巴西參與不明飛行物的調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. And it's not only in the past, like four, five decades ago, but also in recent cases.
→ {"text": "而且不僅是在過去，比如四五十年前，最近的案例也是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. Okay, stop.
→ {"text": "好的，停。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. That's it.
→ {"text": "就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. So, can each of you respond to that?
→ {"text": "那麼，你們每個人都能回應這個問題嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. We'll go right down the line.
→ {"text": "我們會逐個詢問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. I just want to know what relationship, if any, does U.S. have with your experiences and your acts of what we're discussing this week?
→ {"text": "我只想知道，你們的經歷和本週討論的行動與美國有什麼關係，如果有的話？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. I mean, do you automatically give it to them?
→ {"text": "我是說，你們會自動交給他們嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. Is it because we have military bases there?
→ {"text": "是因為我們在那裡有軍事基地嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. Is it because we may get appropriations from us that you must share this?
→ {"text": "是因為你們可能從我們這裡獲得撥款，所以必須分享這些資訊嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. What reason and what is that connection?
→ {"text": "什麼原因，那種連結是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. In the case of the CFAA, in fact, General Bermudez told me that when they created the office back in the late '90s, they contacted the American government, I guess through the embassy because they wanted to have some kind of formal relationship, but there was no response.
→ {"text": "就CEFAA而言，事實上，貝爾穆德斯將軍告訴我，當他們在90年代末成立辦公室時，他們聯繫了美國政府，我想是透過大使館，因為他們希望建立某種正式關係，但沒有得到回應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. They did not respond.
→ {"text": "他們沒有回應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. What year was that?
→ {"text": "那是哪一年？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. No.
→ {"text": "沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. That would have been probably late '90s.
→ {"text": "那應該是90年代末。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

178. But they do have an agreement with not an official group, but it's called NARCAP.
→ {"text": "但他們確實與一個非官方組織有協議，叫做NARCAP。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. I think it stands for National Aviation Research Center for Anomalous Phenomena.
→ {"text": "我想它代表國家航空異常現象研究中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. Located where?
→ {"text": "位於哪裡？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

181. Well, it's run by a former NASA scientist, a very serious man called Dr. Richard Haynes, and he is an expert on aviation cases.
→ {"text": "嗯，它是由一位前NASA科學家經營的，一位非常嚴謹的人，叫做理查德·海恩斯博士，他是航空案例的專家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. He's a long-time NASA scientist, very serious.
→ {"text": "他是一位長期的NASA科學家，非常嚴謹。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. So he's lectured, he's gone to Chile.
→ {"text": "所以他曾經演講，也去過智利。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. They have very close relationship because he's an expert on aviation cases and the CFAA is run by the Civil Aviation.
→ {"text": "他們關係非常密切，因為他是航空案例的專家，而CEFAA是由民航局管理的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. But NARCAP is not an official agency of the U.S. government.
→ {"text": "但NARCAP不是美國政府的官方機構。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. That sounds like a non-profit of some sort, and we've had some testimony here to that effect on our U.S. side that would probably equal that.
→ {"text": "那聽起來像某種非營利組織，我們這裡也有過一些證詞，從我們美國方面的證人那裡，可能與此類似。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. Correct.
→ {"text": "正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

188. So the other thing is what my colleague Javier was mentioning.
→ {"text": "所以另一件事是我的同事哈維爾提到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. If you study the American declassified UFO files, which are extensive, you will see a tremendous amount of documents, especially back in the old days, but there's still some more recent collected by various agencies, usually through the Defense Attaché Office or sometimes by the CIA, and it's obviously that these people are monitoring the international aspect of UFOs.
→ {"text": "如果你研究美國解密的不明飛行物檔案，數量非常龐大，你會看到大量的文件，尤其是早期的，但各機構仍然收集了一些較新的文件，通常是透過國防武官辦公室，有時是透過中情局，顯然這些人在監控不明飛行物的國際層面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. And do you get, does Peru get information back from the U.S. regarding any of what you send them?
→ {"text": "那麼，你們會得到，秘魯會從美國那裡得到任何關於你們發送給他們的資訊的回覆嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. Well, I cannot speak for Peru.
→ {"text": "嗯，我不能代表秘魯發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. In the case of Chile, there might be some at the level of intelligence, they probably do, but then that is not revealed publicly.
→ {"text": "就智利而言，情報層級可能有一些交流，他們可能有，但這不會公開透露。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. You see, what General Bermúdez wanted was to have a formal, but because of the transparency law that would have had to be revealed publicly, so the U.S. just never responded.
→ {"text": "你看，貝爾穆德斯將軍想要的是建立正式關係，但由於透明度法律要求必須公開披露，所以美國就從未回應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. It's Brazil, Chile.
→ {"text": "是巴西、智利。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. Colonel Sanchez, could you respond?
→ {"text": "桑切斯上校，您能回應嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

196. Do you share any of your information, as you testified to us this morning, with U.S. or any non-profit or other entity that may not be government?
→ {"text": "您是否與美國或任何非營利組織或其他非政府實體分享您今天早上向我們作證的任何資訊？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. Do you share any of that with the U.S. government or a non-profit or an agency here in our country that would know what your gay has experienced?
→ {"text": "您是否與美國政府或非營利組織或我國的某個機構分享任何這些資訊，讓他們了解你們的經歷？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文your gay應為your guy之誤"}

198. No, not with any civilian or military agency or U.S. government agency.
→ {"text": "不，沒有與任何民事或軍事機構或美國政府機構分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. There is no sharing or exchange of information.
→ {"text": "沒有資訊的分享或交流。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. Doctor, I want to say Choi, is that right?
→ {"text": "博士，我想說是蔡博士，對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. No.
→ {"text": "不對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. Well, the truth is, one of the conclusions you can draw after having heard the testimony of all the witnesses is that the UFO phenomenon is one of national security, and therefore the intelligence element is extremely important.
→ {"text": "嗯，事實是，在聽完所有證人的證詞後，你可以得出的一個結論是，不明飛行物現象是國家安全問題，因此情報要素極其重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. As far as we understand, in Peru there is no open, formal public agreement, but there are indications that show that some of this information is shared with U.S. security agencies.
→ {"text": "據我們了解，在秘魯沒有公開的、正式的公開協議，但有跡象表明，其中一些資訊會與美國安全機構分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. There's no open public document, but there are witnesses who have noted that in the '80s, apparently a UFO fell in the San Mateo de Huancho area, and they said that there were Americans who were in that area.
→ {"text": "沒有公開的公開文件，但有證人指出，在80年代，顯然有一架不明飛行物墜落在聖馬特奧德萬喬地區，他們說有美國人在那個地區。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. And I do want to remind you that in the Greer Disclosure Project, there were people who made statements, gave testimony, that stated that there was a U.S. Sergeant Jonathan Weygandt who said that a UFO had crashed in northern Peru, and that there was extraction, and this was according to testimony, that they took some of the remains of this falling UFO.
→ {"text": "我確實想提醒你們，在格里爾揭露計畫中，有人發表聲明，提供證詞，說有一位美國中士喬納森·韋甘德說一架不明飛行物在秘魯北部墜毀，並且進行了打撈，根據證詞，他們拿走了這架墜落不明飛行物的一些殘骸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. They were taken away by helicopters that were definitively not part of the Peruvian Armed Forces.
→ {"text": "它們被直升機運走，這些直升機絕對不屬於秘魯武裝部隊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. Excuse me?
→ {"text": "不好意思？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. They were not part of Peru, taken away in helicopters.
→ {"text": "它們不屬於秘魯，是用直升機運走的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. What country was that who took them?
→ {"text": "是哪個國家運走了它們？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. Based on the testimony from the Steven Greer Project, apparently they were American helicopters, and that these materials were taken back to the United States.
→ {"text": "根據史蒂文·格里爾計畫的證詞，顯然那些是美國直升機，這些材料被運回了美國。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. I'm going to change for Colonel Santa Maria.
→ {"text": "我要換個話題問聖瑪利亞上校。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. You're a brave man to go up and down, back and forth, zip, zip, with something you don't know what it is, and you're trying to shoot it?
→ {"text": "您真是個勇敢的人，對著一個您不知道是什麼的東西上下翻飛、來回穿梭，還試圖射擊它？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. That's pretty brave.
→ {"text": "這非常勇敢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. I'm going to commend you for all of that.
→ {"text": "我要為這一切讚揚您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. You did get away clean and free and healthy.
→ {"text": "您確實安全、自由地脫身了，而且身體健康。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. That's a good thing, and thank you very much.
→ {"text": "這是好事，非常感謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. I'm not sure I want to ask you that same question.
→ {"text": "我不確定我想問您那個相同的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. I do want to go to Argentina and ask the same question.
→ {"text": "我確實想問阿根廷代表同樣的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. Do you, Argentina, share either with government or non-government organizations any of your experience, any of the things that you've witnessed to us today with the United States of America, either through its government or other non-profits or unaffiliated?
→ {"text": "阿根廷，您是否與政府或非政府組織分享您的任何經驗，任何您今天向我們作證的事情，與美利堅合眾國分享，無論是透過其政府還是其他非營利組織或無關聯機構？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. Pretty sure.
→ {"text": "非常確定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. I am sure there's some kind of no open communication, but it's possible, but officially I don't see any kind of document or interaction between Argentina government and US agencies, yeah, officially.
→ {"text": "我確信沒有某種公開的交流，但這是可能的，但正式來說，我沒有看到阿根廷政府與美國機構之間有任何文件或互動，是的，正式來說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. But, regarding we were talking, also was very interesting case.
→ {"text": "但是，關於我們正在談論的，也有一個非常有趣的案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. I researched in the decade of '70, '78, there was a UFO crash between Argentina and Bolivia, and supporting what Dr. Choi said was an object who produced a kind of destruction of a hill, was a kind of a cycle shape, a structure of no identified, and the Bolivian government in the study, the Argentinian was a limit, didn't investigate, but that object was retrieved by American's helicopters too.
→ {"text": "我研究了70年代，78年，阿根廷和玻利維亞之間發生了一起不明飛行物墜毀事件，支持蔡博士所說的是一個造成某種山體破壞的物體，是一種圓形形狀，一種未被識別的結構，玻利維亞政府進行了研究，阿根廷有限度參與，沒有深入調查，但那個物體也被美國直升機取走了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. Oh, stop, stop.
→ {"text": "哦，停，停。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. You have no relationship with them, but in that instance, and other instances around the table, we have been on the scene at some of your current experiences.
→ {"text": "你們與他們沒有關係，但在那個案例，以及圍繞這個會議桌的其他案例中，我們曾出現在你們一些當前經歷的現場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. Right, yeah.
→ {"text": "是的，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. It goes back, I want to go back to Dr. Choi for just a moment.
→ {"text": "回到這個話題，我想再問蔡博士一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. Your point was well made in terms of national security, so do you all in South America share your information and experiences and enhance or whatever your national security is, because of what you see and how closely you live together, and just one person, and you know, I don't know.
→ {"text": "您在國家安全方面的觀點說得很好，那麼你們南美國家是否會分享你們的資訊和經驗，並增強你們的國家安全，因為你們所看到的，以及你們彼此生活得如此接近，我只是一個人，你知道，我不知道。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

234. There is an agreement at the level of military in our South America, they share information about a wide variety of subjects, of items, and the UFO is one of them, it has been confirmed by top ranking military in Brazil and in other countries.
→ {"text": "在我們南美洲，軍事層級之間有一項協議，他們分享各種主題和項目的資訊，不明飛行物就是其中之一，這已經得到巴西和其他國家高級軍官的確認。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. It means, and the military level, which is, it's independent than the politics that is a strong.
→ {"text": "這意味著，在軍事層級，這是獨立於政治的，而政治是強大的。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

236. Did you say independent of politics?
→ {"text": "您是說獨立於政治嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. Of politics, because presidents can come and go, but the military stay, and as they stay, they have to have a channel of communication among themselves, so they can talk about interests of each other, that applies in this country too, we just don't acknowledge it as such, it does.
→ {"text": "獨立於政治，因為總統可以來來去去，但軍隊會留下，當他們留下時，他們必須有自己的溝通渠道，這樣他們才能談論彼此的利益，這也適用於這個國家，我們只是不承認這一點，但確實如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. Presidents change, but the military industrial complex is alive and well, and continues so.
→ {"text": "總統會更換，但軍工複合體依然活躍且運作良好，並將持續如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. Right, I'd like to add that.
→ {"text": "是的，我想補充這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. Just a minute, one last question, I've got one minute.
→ {"text": "等一下，最後一個問題，我還有一分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. So therefore, South America, I believe this is an international issue, and that we ought to go back to our congresses and others, but I also think we ought to have UN presence, and there's been some.
→ {"text": "因此，南美，我相信這是一個國際問題，我們應該回到我們的國會和其他機構，但我也認為我們應該有聯合國的參與，而且已經有一些了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. Will your countries help the citizens hearing on disclosure go to the UN to ask for their help in this subject, and will your countries help petition us with that?
→ {"text": "你們的國家會幫助公民聽證會關於真相揭露，前往聯合國尋求他們在這個主題上的幫助嗎？你們的國家會幫助我們就此提出請願嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. Yes, of course.
→ {"text": "是的，當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. It's what we want.
→ {"text": "這就是我們想要的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. We would like.
→ {"text": "我們願意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. You didn't say it.
→ {"text": "您沒有說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. You didn't say it.
→ {"text": "您沒有說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. I want to hear it.
→ {"text": "我想聽到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. Okay, that's good.
→ {"text": "好的，這很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. No, no, no.
→ {"text": "不，不，不。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. I think that's good.
→ {"text": "我認為這很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. That's what we want to hear.
→ {"text": "這就是我們想聽到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. Because these official agencies, they want a place where their data can be shared officially with other countries, because the UFO phenomenon, by definition, is global.
→ {"text": "因為這些官方機構，他們希望有一個可以與其他國家正式分享數據的地方，因為不明飛行物現象，就其定義而言，是全球性的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. Like I said, they don't care about national boundaries.
→ {"text": "就像我說的，它們不在乎國界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. That's our problem.
→ {"text": "這是我們的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. They care about national security, though, and technology.
→ {"text": "不過，它們關心國家安全和技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. So I mean, it's got to be a way to do it.
→ {"text": "所以我的意思是，必須有辦法做到這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. I think a new opinion may know better, and so certainly more people in this room know better than I.
→ {"text": "我認為新的意見可能更清楚，所以當然這個房間裡的更多人比我更了解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. Well, that is the problem, because as you know, and in Congress, I'm sure you've dealt with many issues dealing with intelligence and national security.
→ {"text": "嗯，這就是問題所在，因為如您所知，在國會，我相信您處理過許多與情報和國家安全相關的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. There's all kinds of things going on under the rug, you know?
→ {"text": "地毯下正在發生各種事情，你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. I mean, informally, intelligence agencies, they have their own procedures, but those are not made public.
