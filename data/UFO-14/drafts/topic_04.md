## Speaker Group 1

359. I'd like to start with our colleague from Brazil. Yes, sir. You mentioned that the government responded from an investigatory point of view to the apparent violent attacks that took place in the Amazon area, killing people. Now, that's the first, at least that I am aware of anywhere in the world, where an aggressive attack resulting in loss of life that was the product of a flying saucer, extraterrestrial effort. Could you elaborate a little bit more specifically on the investigation that was made over the death of these people? Yes.

360. We don't know for what reason that took place, but that happened. During two or three years, like 1976, '77, '78, we had casualties, at least four casualties, and we have a record of 400 people attacked. Not only people, but also animals were attacked by these beams of light that would come from these balls, these spaceships. Sometimes they were referred to like a can with a windshield and two persons, two human-like creatures inside of it operating that spaceship. This has been described in detail by lots of people who live in the area of Salgado, especially in the island of Colares, which is 60 or 70 miles from the city of Belém.

361. This has also been reported by the military. Now, the very interesting thing about it is that when the military decided to camp there and to conduct their investigations, the attacks stopped. Very rare attacks took place in other areas, but not where the military were. Also, when the military decided to change their camping from one point of the island to another point of the island, the objects that would be hovering, that previous point where the operations were taking place, would move to the other area, like in the own words of the commander of the Operation Saucer, Uyrangê Hollanda, like if these intelligences knew what the military were doing in that area. That's very amazing. These are only 440 pages of a total of 2,000 pages that were produced as a result of the Operation Saucer. I would like to address this to you. I would like that you have time to examine this because this contained very

362. hard information collected in a military fashion by military men on duty investigating UFOs in a confidential, not top secret, but confidential, sometimes reserved operation by the Brazilian Air Force and the Amazon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. Has the military who have been in charge of this investigation, have they been transparent with the public in Brazil?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. As I told before, on that day, we are under military dictatorship, so there wasn't much transparency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. Presently, after the dictatorship left?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. Yes. The gentleman that conducted the Operation Saucer, the commander of it, was a captain at that time, and he retired as a coronel. And 20 years after the Operation Saucer was shut down, this man called me and invited me to his place, to his house in Rio de Janeiro where he was living. And I spent two days with him, interviewing him extensively where he gave me full details of everything that happened during those four months. And he also described me how he and his men had a close encounter with the creatures that came in those objects. And that actually, this main encounter with an alien creature that took place in mid-December, 1977, was what caused the Operation Saucer to be shut down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. And in my reading of it is because the Brazilian military wouldn't know what to do if this context, open context among military and extraterrestrial start being regular in the Amazon, what we can do now. So then the Operation Saucer was shut down. But just to add a few more pieces of information that it was only asked to say shut down to make pretend, because the Operation Saucer then became, in a second level, much more secret and was conducted for several more months under military, US military command in Brazilian territory.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. Well, I think you partially answered the next question was that was there a US presence interfacing with your military in the investigation of these UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. You have documentary evidence of that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. I have the reports given to me by the commander of the Operation Saucer that he interacted many, many times with Brazilian intelligence agents members and US intelligence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. Which would be the CIA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. That will be the CIA and also military. They will be all over the Amazon looking for the same kind of information that we are looking for, about who are those intelligences that pilot those machines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. Do you not find that somewhat bizarre that our government now officially says that there's no investigation that we were involved with, no documentation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. I would say that is more than bizarre.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. Okay. Let me move on to my question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. Even our government is admitting in the farthest end that there has been official investigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. Now we started in Brazil in 2004 a movement, a campaign called UFOs Freedom of Information Now to request to the government to open its files and we have succeeded.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. It's the only model like this in this planet where the society have asked its government to come clear about it and it came. At least partially because we have got from 2008 to 2010 not only 4,500 pages of UFO document but also like 300 to 400 pictures of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. This is all given to the society. This has all been put in the National Archives. Anybody can go to the National Archives in Brasilia or in Rio and see this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. Was there panic in the streets when this was revealed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Not at all. Not for a single minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. So the people were mature enough to accept this knowledge?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. Let me go to my friend from Chile. Do you have any knowledge of American military presence or intelligence presence interfacing with the officials in Chile gathering information on UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. Not really except if you look historically some of the FOIA documents released by the CIA. Usually it was the Defense Attaché Office that if it was a very important case they would send those guys to collect the information. Historically in some of the release files there are occasionally some documents about Chile but not recently. I have not seen it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. Like I said General Bermudez the head of the committee actually wanted to have a relationship but he wanted to be open and official.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. We didn't want that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. That says a lot. With respect and you've drafted or you've worked with Danny Sheehan in drafting a resolution that can come from this body trying to refer this matter to the General Assembly of the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. Yeah because it has to be a mechanism like I said on the first day in this hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. Could you circulate that document as soon as possible to the members so we can begin to digest it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. Okay although we have really not this is a kind of thing that we need to discuss.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. I realize it's a draft. We're all very sophisticated in dealing with drafts and first writings but we can massage something as long as we have something in our hands.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. Now to my colleague from Uruguay. Did I understand you correctly that your system of investigation has been transparent and open to the public from the very beginning? Did I understand that properly?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. Yes, that's correct. In fact Uruguay has published through this commission a book that I brought here to show you with more than 20 cases of Uruguay, official cases written by the first president of this group, Colonel Eduardo Aguirre, who wrote this book 11 years ago. It was published publicly so that the public could follow all of the ufological activity in Uruguay. There are also press conferences and the information is even taken to the schools to talk to them about this and even educate them on this issue. This commission is made up by both civil and military members. It has a work methodology that was adopted in 1979 and this methodology was also shared with China.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. You just said that this was brought to the schools so it could be educated to the young people of your country. Is that correct?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. Yes, that's correct. The UFO issue is something that everybody likes to hear about, especially young people, at least in Uruguay. And they request that the Air Force go and give talks to the kids, and they go to many different places.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. When the U.S. helicopter retrieves the materials from the downed UFO aircraft, was there no reaction to a violation of your sovereignty by the United States of America or do you just accept these kind of violations as a matter of course?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. Actually, this information, well we just recently learned about this based on the disclosure project that Stephen Greer carried out based on the testimony that a military official, Jonathan Weygandt, provided. This was circulated in the UFO groups in Peru. It never made it to the press in Peru. And the press is the same here as it is in Peru. They don't really talk about it. And so the media generally try to cover up any type of thing like this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. So the government doesn't really give importance to this, and they say, well we're just going to keep it in the corner here, and they're just going to say that there wasn't a real invasion of sovereignty.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. You should take a page from the Uruguayan approach to the issue. Colonel Santa Maria, who gave the order to shoot? Was that your own initiative or did it come from higher headquarters as you were selected and taking off?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. The order was to intercept and destroy. Because this is something that could invade our airspace.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. That's right. That answers my question. Thank you. I think my time is expired, so I can't get to Argentina. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
