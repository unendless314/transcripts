## Speaker Group 1

359. I'd like to start with our colleague from Brazil. Yes, sir. You mentioned that the government responded from an investigatory point of view to the apparent violent attacks that took place in the Amazon area, killing people. Now, that's the first, at least that I am aware of anywhere in the world, where an aggressive attack resulting in loss of life that was the product of a flying saucer, extraterrestrial effort. Could you elaborate a little bit more specifically on the investigation that was made over the death of these people? Yes.
→ {"text": "我想先請教來自巴西的證人。是的，先生。您提到政府從調查的角度回應了亞馬遜地區發生的明顯暴力攻擊事件，這些事件造成了人員死亡。據我所知，這是全世界首次發生由飛碟、外星活動所導致的攻擊性襲擊並造成人員傷亡的案例。您能否更具體地說明一下針對這些死亡事件所進行的調查？好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. We don't know for what reason that took place, but that happened. During two or three years, like 1976, '77, '78, we had casualties, at least four casualties, and we have a record of 400 people attacked. Not only people, but also animals were attacked by these beams of light that would come from these balls, these spaceships. Sometimes they were referred to like a can with a windshield and two persons, two human-like creatures inside of it operating that spaceship. This has been described in detail by lots of people who live in the area of Salgado, especially in the island of Colares, which is 60 or 70 miles from the city of Belém.
→ {"text": "我們不知道這是出於什麼原因發生的，但確實發生了。在1976、77、78年這兩到三年間，我們有人員傷亡，至少有四人死亡，而且我們有記錄顯示400人遭到攻擊。不僅是人類，動物也遭到攻擊，攻擊來自這些球狀物體、這些太空船所發出的光束。有時它們被描述成像一個帶有擋風玻璃的罐子，裡面有兩個人、兩個類人生物在操作那艘太空船。薩爾加多地區的許多居民，特別是科拉雷斯島的居民，都詳細描述了這一情況，該島距離貝倫市約60到70英里。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. This has also been reported by the military. Now, the very interesting thing about it is that when the military decided to camp there and to conduct their investigations, the attacks stopped. Very rare attacks took place in other areas, but not where the military were. Also, when the military decided to change their camping from one point of the island to another point of the island, the objects that would be hovering, that previous point where the operations were taking place, would move to the other area, like in the own words of the commander of the Operation Saucer, Uyrangê Hollanda, like if these intelligences knew what the military were doing in that area. That's very amazing. These are only 440 pages of a total of 2,000 pages that were produced as a result of the Operation Saucer. I would like to address this to you. I would like that you have time to examine this because this contained very
→ {"text": "軍方也報告了這些情況。現在，非常有趣的一點是，當軍方決定在那裡紮營並進行調查時，攻擊就停止了。其他地區很少發生攻擊事件，但軍方駐紮的地方則沒有。此外，當軍方決定將營地從島上的一個地點轉移到另一個地點時，那些盤旋的物體，也就是之前行動進行的地點，會移動到另一個區域。用飛碟行動指揮官烏伊蘭吉·奧蘭達的話來說，就好像這些智慧生物知道軍方在那個地區做什麼一樣。這非常驚人。這只是飛碟行動所產生的2000頁文件中的440頁。我想將這些文件呈交給各位，希望各位有時間審閱，因為這裡面包含了非常", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Uyrangê Hollanda 為巴西飛碟行動指揮官，保留原名"}

362. hard information collected in a military fashion by military men on duty investigating UFOs in a confidential, not top secret, but confidential, sometimes reserved operation by the Brazilian Air Force and the Amazon.
→ {"text": "以軍事方式收集的確切資訊，由執勤的軍事人員調查不明飛行物，這是巴西空軍在亞馬遜地區進行的機密行動，不是最高機密，而是機密，有時是內部保密性質的行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. Has the military who have been in charge of this investigation, have they been transparent with the public in Brazil?
→ {"text": "負責這項調查的軍方，他們對巴西公眾是否透明？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. As I told before, on that day, we are under military dictatorship, so there wasn't much transparency.
→ {"text": "正如我之前所說，在那個時期，我們處於軍事獨裁政權之下，所以沒有太多透明度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. Presently, after the dictatorship left?
→ {"text": "那麼現在呢，在獨裁政權結束之後？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. Yes. The gentleman that conducted the Operation Saucer, the commander of it, was a captain at that time, and he retired as a coronel. And 20 years after the Operation Saucer was shut down, this man called me and invited me to his place, to his house in Rio de Janeiro where he was living. And I spent two days with him, interviewing him extensively where he gave me full details of everything that happened during those four months. And he also described me how he and his men had a close encounter with the creatures that came in those objects. And that actually, this main encounter with an alien creature that took place in mid-December, 1977, was what caused the Operation Saucer to be shut down.
→ {"text": "是的。執行飛碟行動的那位先生，也就是行動指揮官，當時是一名上尉，他以中校軍銜退役。在飛碟行動結束20年後，這位先生打電話給我，邀請我到他位於里約熱內盧的住所。我和他相處了兩天，進行了詳細的訪談，他向我提供了那四個月期間發生的一切的完整細節。他還向我描述了他和他的部下如何與那些物體中的生物進行了近距離接觸。實際上，1977年12月中旬與外星生物的這次主要接觸，正是導致飛碟行動被關閉的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. And in my reading of it is because the Brazilian military wouldn't know what to do if this context, open context among military and extraterrestrial start being regular in the Amazon, what we can do now. So then the Operation Saucer was shut down. But just to add a few more pieces of information that it was only asked to say shut down to make pretend, because the Operation Saucer then became, in a second level, much more secret and was conducted for several more months under military, US military command in Brazilian territory.
→ {"text": "依我的理解，這是因為如果軍方與外星生物在亞馬遜地區開始經常性公開接觸，巴西軍方將不知道該如何應對，我們現在能做什麼。於是飛碟行動被關閉了。但我要補充一些資訊，表面上說是關閉，但實際上是為了掩人耳目，因為飛碟行動隨後進入了第二階段，變得更加機密，並在巴西領土上由美國軍方指揮繼續進行了數個月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. Well, I think you partially answered the next question was that was there a US presence interfacing with your military in the investigation of these UFOs?
→ {"text": "我想您已經部分回答了下一個問題，那就是在調查這些不明飛行物時，是否有美國人員與貴國軍方進行接觸？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. You have documentary evidence of that?
→ {"text": "您有這方面的文件證據嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. I have the reports given to me by the commander of the Operation Saucer that he interacted many, many times with Brazilian intelligence agents members and US intelligence.
→ {"text": "我擁有飛碟行動指揮官交給我的報告，其中記錄了他多次與巴西情報人員和美國情報機構進行互動的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. Which would be the CIA.
→ {"text": "也就是CIA（中央情報局）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. That will be the CIA and also military. They will be all over the Amazon looking for the same kind of information that we are looking for, about who are those intelligences that pilot those machines.
→ {"text": "包括CIA和軍方人員。他們遍布整個亞馬遜地區，尋找與我們相同類型的資訊，關於是什麼樣的智慧生物在駕駛那些機器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

374. Do you not find that somewhat bizarre that our government now officially says that there's no investigation that we were involved with, no documentation?
→ {"text": "您不覺得這有些奇怪嗎，我們的政府現在正式表示沒有任何我們參與的調查，沒有任何文件記錄？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. I would say that is more than bizarre.
→ {"text": "我會說這不僅僅是奇怪而已。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. Okay. Let me move on to my question.
→ {"text": "好的。讓我繼續我的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. Even our government is admitting in the farthest end that there has been official investigation.
→ {"text": "即使我們的政府在某種程度上也承認曾經有過官方調查。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

378. Now we started in Brazil in 2004 a movement, a campaign called UFOs Freedom of Information Now to request to the government to open its files and we have succeeded.
→ {"text": "我們於2004年在巴西發起了一項運動，一個名為「UFO：即刻資訊自由」的運動，要求政府公開其檔案，而我們已經成功了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. It's the only model like this in this planet where the society have asked its government to come clear about it and it came. At least partially because we have got from 2008 to 2010 not only 4,500 pages of UFO document but also like 300 to 400 pictures of UFOs.
→ {"text": "這是地球上唯一一個社會要求政府對此事公開透明，而政府也照做了的模式。至少部分如此，因為從2008年到2010年，我們不僅獲得了4500頁的不明飛行物文件，還有300到400張不明飛行物的照片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. This is all given to the society. This has all been put in the National Archives. Anybody can go to the National Archives in Brasilia or in Rio and see this.
→ {"text": "這些都提供給了社會大眾。所有資料都已存入巴西國家檔案館。任何人都可以去巴西利亞或里約的國家檔案館查閱這些資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. Was there panic in the streets when this was revealed?
→ {"text": "當這些資訊被公開時，街頭是否有恐慌情緒？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. Not at all. Not for a single minute.
→ {"text": "完全沒有。一刻也沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. So the people were mature enough to accept this knowledge?
→ {"text": "所以人民已經足夠成熟，可以接受這些資訊了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

384. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "絕對如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. Let me go to my friend from Chile. Do you have any knowledge of American military presence or intelligence presence interfacing with the officials in Chile gathering information on UFOs?
→ {"text": "讓我請教來自智利的證人。您是否知道有美國軍事人員或情報人員與智利官員接觸，收集有關不明飛行物的資訊？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. Not really except if you look historically some of the FOIA documents released by the CIA. Usually it was the Defense Attaché Office that if it was a very important case they would send those guys to collect the information. Historically in some of the release files there are occasionally some documents about Chile but not recently. I have not seen it.
→ {"text": "並沒有，除非從歷史角度來看CIA根據資訊自由法公開的一些文件。通常是由國防武官辦公室負責，如果是非常重要的案件，他們會派員去收集資訊。從歷史上看，一些公開文件中偶爾會有關於智利的文件，但最近沒有。我沒有看到過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. Like I said General Bermudez the head of the committee actually wanted to have a relationship but he wanted to be open and official.
→ {"text": "正如我所說，委員會負責人貝爾穆德斯將軍確實希望建立合作關係，但他希望是公開且正式的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. We didn't want that.
→ {"text": "但我們不希望那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. That says a lot. With respect and you've drafted or you've worked with Danny Sheehan in drafting a resolution that can come from this body trying to refer this matter to the General Assembly of the United States.
→ {"text": "這說明了很多問題。順帶一提，您曾與丹尼·希恩合作起草一份決議案，希望由本機構將此事提交給聯合國大會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. Yeah because it has to be a mechanism like I said on the first day in this hearing.
→ {"text": "是的，因為必須有一個機制，就像我在聽證會第一天所說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. Could you circulate that document as soon as possible to the members so we can begin to digest it?
→ {"text": "您能否盡快將該文件分發給各位成員，以便我們開始研讀？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. Okay although we have really not this is a kind of thing that we need to discuss.
→ {"text": "好的，雖然我們還沒有，這是我們需要討論的事情。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

393. I realize it's a draft. We're all very sophisticated in dealing with drafts and first writings but we can massage something as long as we have something in our hands.
→ {"text": "我明白這是草稿。我們都非常善於處理草稿和初稿，只要我們手上有東西，我們就可以進行修改潤飾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. Now to my colleague from Uruguay. Did I understand you correctly that your system of investigation has been transparent and open to the public from the very beginning? Did I understand that properly?
→ {"text": "現在請教來自烏拉圭的證人。我是否正確理解，貴國的調查系統從一開始就是透明且對公眾開放的？我的理解正確嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. Yes, that's correct. In fact Uruguay has published through this commission a book that I brought here to show you with more than 20 cases of Uruguay, official cases written by the first president of this group, Colonel Eduardo Aguirre, who wrote this book 11 years ago. It was published publicly so that the public could follow all of the ufological activity in Uruguay. There are also press conferences and the information is even taken to the schools to talk to them about this and even educate them on this issue. This commission is made up by both civil and military members. It has a work methodology that was adopted in 1979 and this methodology was also shared with China.
→ {"text": "是的，沒錯。事實上，烏拉圭透過這個委員會出版了一本書，我帶來這裡給各位看，書中記載了超過20個烏拉圭的案例，都是由這個小組的第一任主席愛德華多·阿吉雷上校撰寫的官方案例，他在11年前寫了這本書。這本書公開出版，以便公眾能夠了解烏拉圭所有的不明飛行物活動。此外還有新聞發布會，相關資訊甚至會帶到學校，向學生講解這個議題，甚至對他們進行教育。這個委員會由民間和軍方成員共同組成。它採用了一套於1979年制定的工作方法論，這套方法論也曾與中國分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. You just said that this was brought to the schools so it could be educated to the young people of your country. Is that correct?
→ {"text": "您剛才說這些資訊被帶到學校，以便對貴國的年輕人進行教育。是這樣嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. Yes, that's correct. The UFO issue is something that everybody likes to hear about, especially young people, at least in Uruguay. And they request that the Air Force go and give talks to the kids, and they go to many different places.
→ {"text": "是的，沒錯。不明飛行物議題是每個人都喜歡聽的，尤其是年輕人，至少在烏拉圭是這樣。他們會要求空軍去給孩子們做演講，而他們也會去很多不同的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. When the U.S. helicopter retrieves the materials from the downed UFO aircraft, was there no reaction to a violation of your sovereignty by the United States of America or do you just accept these kind of violations as a matter of course?
→ {"text": "當美國直升機從墜毀的不明飛行物上取走材料時，對於美國侵犯貴國主權的行為，難道沒有任何反應嗎？還是您們只是將這類侵犯視為理所當然而接受？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. Actually, this information, well we just recently learned about this based on the disclosure project that Stephen Greer carried out based on the testimony that a military official, Jonathan Weygandt, provided. This was circulated in the UFO groups in Peru. It never made it to the press in Peru. And the press is the same here as it is in Peru. They don't really talk about it. And so the media generally try to cover up any type of thing like this.
→ {"text": "事實上，這個資訊，我們是最近才得知的，是基於史蒂芬·格里爾進行的揭露計畫，以及軍方官員喬納森·韋甘德所提供的證詞。這在祕魯的不明飛行物團體中流傳，但從未出現在祕魯的媒體上。這裡的媒體和祕魯一樣，他們並不真正報導這類事情。因此，媒體通常會試圖掩蓋任何這類事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. So the government doesn't really give importance to this, and they say, well we're just going to keep it in the corner here, and they're just going to say that there wasn't a real invasion of sovereignty.
→ {"text": "所以政府並沒有真正重視這件事，他們說，我們就先把這件事擺在一邊，然後他們會說這並沒有真正的侵犯主權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. You should take a page from the Uruguayan approach to the issue. Colonel Santa Maria, who gave the order to shoot? Was that your own initiative or did it come from higher headquarters as you were selected and taking off?
→ {"text": "您們應該借鏡烏拉圭處理這個問題的方式。聖瑪利亞上校，是誰下達開火命令的？那是您自己的決定，還是來自上級指揮部，當您被選中並起飛時就已經下達的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. The order was to intercept and destroy. Because this is something that could invade our airspace.
→ {"text": "命令是攔截並摧毀。因為這是可能侵犯我國領空的物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. That's right. That answers my question. Thank you. I think my time is expired, so I can't get to Argentina. Thank you.
→ {"text": "沒錯。這回答了我的問題。謝謝。我想我的時間已經到了，所以無法繼續詢問阿根廷的證人了。謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
