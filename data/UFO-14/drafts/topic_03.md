## Speaker Group 1

291. Chair, I'd like to turn to Colonel Santa Maria for a moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. This Department of Defense memo that's stamped in June of 1980 that was, I guess you actually showed this up on the screen, also is a test to your testimony, or your story, I should say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. Then, of course, you testified about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. Is this memo referring directly to your experience that was, indeed, as someone's already said, very dramatic and had what we call here, and I think everywhere, the wow factor to it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. Is this a memo that relates to, and are you prohibited from telling us, or something?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. It sounds like this happened in April.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. This is something with the June stamp on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. It looks like our Joint Chiefs of Staff ... Confirm, if you can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. The Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States of America have made these comments, or at least received these comments, from Peru.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. We have this in writing as a document that talks about these very experiences of shooting at UFOs with the statement, I have to say here, that the source has been known as credible before in all respects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. In other words, what you experienced was not even questioned by people, and copies of this, CIA, the National Security Agency, I could go on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. Is this a smoking gun, or what, for trying to open up some files here in the United States?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. I mean ... But now I want to hear your answer, because it sounds, whether it was you or not, something very similar to what you said happened, it looks like in April or May, so I'm thinking it might be you they're talking about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. Go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. In 2007, in this same building, I was invited to take part in a conference on the declassification of documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. There was a journalist, Edwin Cain, and there was a filmmaker, James Fox, who was making a documentary, and they turned over a copy of this document to me, and they said, "We would like to invite you to our country, because our country has accredited this encounter," and so when I reviewed the data in 1980, the only encounter with a UFO was my encounter, and so the date of this memorandum was about 28 days later, so there were no other occurrences at the same base, so I believe in the sharing of information, you can see that this was the event being referred to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. Well, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. And I just want everybody in this room to hear that even though, again, we have a humble observer that doesn't like to in any way overstate anything, that was a really strong yes to my question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. It was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. There's no other way to interpret that, and I appreciate that, and I have to say, since the way you described this, and the fact that you actually shot, I'm going to use the word bullets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. I know that that's not the right word.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. I'm not much in knowledge of Air Force weaponry and so on, but you shot at this, and are you a good marksman?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. I don't know the right word to use.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. Obviously, you shot at this, and would you repeat again what happened?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. Well, these were 22 minutes of this relationship where we went up and down and went around.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. It was trying to avoid me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. I was pursuing it, and I was trying to fire.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. When I first fired, these were bursts of 30-millimeter shells, so they're about three centimeters wide, 25 centimeters long, and they can destroy a truck, a single one, and there were 64, so it was just a barrage of fire, and nothing happened at all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. That's what was so surprising.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. The possibility of not hitting my target, it was practically impossible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. I've won awards for marksmanship, so I have won some shooting contests, and so they were like, "Hey, you're the one who needs to go up there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. You're the one who needs to chase this thing."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. I just don't want you to be quite so humble in the way you're explaining this, please, because it took a little too long to say, "Hey, he wouldn't really have missed this."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. Now, he didn't say it that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. He said it more carefully, but there's no question you wouldn't have missed it based on everything you said, and based on how those 30 caliber shells, as you've described, would have taken out a truck.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. I mean, you didn't even have to be a great shot, but they picked you because of your ability to shoot at something they were worried about, coming in on the air base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. Am I correct?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. And I want you to continue with your answer, as far as what happened after you shot the way you did at it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. Well, so I shot these birds, in our training, we are always firing on a three meter by three meter target, and in this case, this was a 10 meter by 10 meter objective target, so the possibility of missing was zero.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. These hit the object, and when it started to move away, I put on my post combustion so that I could chase it to maneuver, to try to get in position, but it's this mental exercise of how am I going to do this, and when it was moving away, I thought, how is it doing this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. How can I better attack it, so I tried different positions until it came to the point when it had supersonic speed, when it would go up, I tried to get in my sights vertically, but when I moved to the side of the UFO at 1.3 mach, the UFO which was stopped, it achieved 1.2 mach in a question of seconds without any engines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. This is something that no craft can do, to just go from 0 to 1.2 mach vertically to reach my same position, this is a UFO that knew the way our aircraft worked, because it was able to anticipate my moves and then follow me, and then once I landed, I met with intelligence officers, and we looked at all catalogs to see what possible spy objects this might have been, but they all had some type of engine, there was nothing similar to what I had observed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. So this was an unidentified object, and we were unaware of any type of technology on earth that existed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. Will you allow me to make a comment?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. Please Dr. Choy, I'd like to hear Dr. Choy's, since you're from Peru of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. Thank you very much, perhaps because the commander is so humble, he has not expressed certain details, but I wanted to share something that I believe that you should know and I should underscore.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. I would ask the, if I could interrupt you for one moment, I would ask the colonel to nod his head yes on any detail where I'm, either yes or no, just to be sure that he's, because I agree, one of the problems is you have a, not a problem in my opinion, but you have somebody that does not like to in any way bring attention to himself or overstate his own abilities or what he did when he, just description, denied by our Joint Chiefs of Staff was amazing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. I just want him to confirm what you say because I do want to believe that it would be useful this panel to have him acknowledge anything you say that wouldn't add to that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. One of the things that we have heard in previous days is the possibility that many of these UFO events are due to earthly craft, but in the case of Colonel Santa Maria, we can prove that this was not anything, any technology we see here on earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. In the military terminology, there was a wall of fire basically that he came up, that this object came up against.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. There's nothing on earth that could defend itself against that specifically in that time, not even up to today, not because it was able to only defend itself, but as the colonel stated, well you asked him what was the impact that it had on that, it actually, there was no impact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. It absorbed all of these rounds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. It actually absorbed it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. That is absolutely impossible for any earth or any technology that we have here on earth to be able to absorb that type of barrage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. If I could interrupt you for just a moment and say, do you agree with the two or three important points there that Dr. Troy just made?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. Yes, I do agree because over time we have talked about the possible situations and the different perspectives that exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. Obviously I fired, and there should have been some sort of impact, but there was nothing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. There was no, the bullets didn't even explode.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. There was no explosion of the barrage of what I was firing, so it just absorbed it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. Okay, thank you very much, and I'd love to continue with this, but I do need to ask another question here with just a minute on my time left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. We have one minute left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. That's right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. That's what I said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. I'd like to go over here to Mr., excuse me, Colonel Sanchez.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. Your system in Uruguay that apparently has been in existence for 33 years, you say, that it's a track, and keep track of anything that's cited, it's called, I can't remember the operation name of it, or the, excuse me, let me grab my notes, I'm so mesmerized by the previous testimony, but the system you have where you outline the five or six steps to even get qualified to be seriously looked at, and then tracked as far as any UFO sightings that your organization in Uruguay keeps track of, do you have records of things similar to what we've just been talking about with Colonel Santa Maria, and I'm not sure if Peru and Europe, they do have the same language, don't they, or you obviously heard everything anyway, but through these translations, so I'd like to know anything that might be in that, that kind of talks about this sort of thing, and since I'll be out of time, if you keep your
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. answer somewhat short, but. Yes, we for the last 33 years have had an Air Force commission that also is accountable to the public on all issues dealing with UFOs. This commission also has military and civilian members, and also does have archives of 1300 cases that had been investigated, 3% of which, there are 39 or 40 cases now that have not been solved because of the level of bizarreness that they presented, and Uruguay has scientifically addressed the UFO issue and does not rule out the extraterrestrial element, but for this we do need scientific evidence. We do have cases, such as that which Colonel Santa Maria mentioned, and how fighter jets were scrambled to chase these objects, and how there was a chase, an in-air chase, and following glowing objects, and sometimes they would get close to, and how these objects would get close to air bases throughout Latin America.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. Thank you. A wise course, by the way. Thank you. Trust but verify. Senator. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
