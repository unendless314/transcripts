## Speaker Group 1

291. Chair, I'd like to turn to Colonel Santa Maria for a moment.
→ {"text": "主席，我想請聖瑪利亞上校發言一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. This Department of Defense memo that's stamped in June of 1980 that was, I guess you actually showed this up on the screen, also is a test to your testimony, or your story, I should say.
→ {"text": "這份1980年6月蓋章的國防部備忘錄，我想您實際上已經在螢幕上展示了，這也是對您證詞的佐證，或者說您的經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. Then, of course, you testified about this.
→ {"text": "當然，您也為此作證了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. Is this memo referring directly to your experience that was, indeed, as someone's already said, very dramatic and had what we call here, and I think everywhere, the wow factor to it?
→ {"text": "這份備忘錄是否直接指涉您的經歷？正如有人已經說過的，這確實非常戲劇性，具有我們在這裡稱之為『驚嘆因素』的特質，我想在任何地方都一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. Is this a memo that relates to, and are you prohibited from telling us, or something?
→ {"text": "這份備忘錄是否與之相關？您是否被禁止告訴我們，還是怎麼回事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. It sounds like this happened in April.
→ {"text": "聽起來這件事發生在四月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. This is something with the June stamp on it.
→ {"text": "這份文件蓋的是六月的章。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. It looks like our Joint Chiefs of Staff ... Confirm, if you can.
→ {"text": "看起來我們的參謀長聯席會議……如果可以的話，請您確認。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. The Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States of America have made these comments, or at least received these comments, from Peru.
→ {"text": "美利堅合眾國參謀長聯席會議發表了這些評論，或至少收到了來自祕魯的這些評論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. We have this in writing as a document that talks about these very experiences of shooting at UFOs with the statement, I have to say here, that the source has been known as credible before in all respects.
→ {"text": "我們有書面文件記載了這些向不明飛行物開火的經歷，我必須在此說明，消息來源在各方面都被認為是可信的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. In other words, what you experienced was not even questioned by people, and copies of this, CIA, the National Security Agency, I could go on.
→ {"text": "換句話說，您的經歷甚至沒有受到質疑，這份文件的副本分發給了CIA、國家安全局等機構，我還可以繼續列舉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. Is this a smoking gun, or what, for trying to open up some files here in the United States?
→ {"text": "這是否就是所謂的『確鑿證據』，有助於在美國這裡公開一些文件？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. I mean ... But now I want to hear your answer, because it sounds, whether it was you or not, something very similar to what you said happened, it looks like in April or May, so I'm thinking it might be you they're talking about.
→ {"text": "我的意思是……但現在我想聽聽您的回答，因為聽起來，無論是不是您，發生的事情與您描述的非常相似，看起來是在四月或五月，所以我想他們說的可能就是您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. Go ahead.
→ {"text": "請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. In 2007, in this same building, I was invited to take part in a conference on the declassification of documents.
→ {"text": "2007年，就在這棟建築裡，我受邀參加一個關於文件解密的會議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. There was a journalist, Edwin Cain, and there was a filmmaker, James Fox, who was making a documentary, and they turned over a copy of this document to me, and they said, "We would like to invite you to our country, because our country has accredited this encounter," and so when I reviewed the data in 1980, the only encounter with a UFO was my encounter, and so the date of this memorandum was about 28 days later, so there were no other occurrences at the same base, so I believe in the sharing of information, you can see that this was the event being referred to.
→ {"text": "當時有一位記者Edwin Cain，還有一位正在拍攝紀錄片的電影製片人James Fox，他們把這份文件的副本交給我，並說：『我們想邀請您到我們國家，因為我們的國家已經認可了這次遭遇。』所以當我回顧1980年的資料時，唯一一次與不明飛行物的遭遇就是我的那次遭遇，而這份備忘錄的日期大約是在28天後，同一基地沒有發生其他事件，所以我相信透過資訊共享，您可以看出這指的就是那次事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. Well, thank you.
→ {"text": "好的，謝謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. And I just want everybody in this room to hear that even though, again, we have a humble observer that doesn't like to in any way overstate anything, that was a really strong yes to my question.
→ {"text": "我只想讓這個房間裡的每個人都聽到，儘管再次強調，我們有一位謙遜的證人，他不喜歡以任何方式誇大任何事情，但這對我的問題是一個非常明確的肯定回答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. It was.
→ {"text": "確實如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. There's no other way to interpret that, and I appreciate that, and I have to say, since the way you described this, and the fact that you actually shot, I'm going to use the word bullets.
→ {"text": "這沒有其他解讀方式，我很感激這一點，而且我必須說，鑑於您描述的方式，以及您實際上開火了的事實，我要用『子彈』這個詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. I know that that's not the right word.
→ {"text": "我知道這不是正確的用詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. I'm not much in knowledge of Air Force weaponry and so on, but you shot at this, and are you a good marksman?
→ {"text": "我對空軍武器等方面不是很了解，但您向它開火了，而且您的射擊技術好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. I don't know the right word to use.
→ {"text": "我不知道該用什麼正確的詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. Obviously, you shot at this, and would you repeat again what happened?
→ {"text": "顯然，您向它開火了，能否請您再重複一次發生了什麼事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. Well, these were 22 minutes of this relationship where we went up and down and went around.
→ {"text": "嗯，這是一段22分鐘的交鋒過程，我們上下盤旋、來回追逐。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. It was trying to avoid me.
→ {"text": "它試圖躲避我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. I was pursuing it, and I was trying to fire.
→ {"text": "我在追逐它，並試圖開火。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. When I first fired, these were bursts of 30-millimeter shells, so they're about three centimeters wide, 25 centimeters long, and they can destroy a truck, a single one, and there were 64, so it was just a barrage of fire, and nothing happened at all.
→ {"text": "當我第一次開火時，發射的是30毫米炮彈的連發，每發大約3公分寬、25公分長，單單一發就能摧毀一輛卡車，而我發射了64發，簡直是彈如雨下，但完全沒有任何效果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

319. That's what was so surprising.
→ {"text": "這正是令人驚訝之處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. No.
→ {"text": "沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. The possibility of not hitting my target, it was practically impossible.
→ {"text": "沒有擊中目標的可能性，這幾乎是不可能的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. I've won awards for marksmanship, so I have won some shooting contests, and so they were like, "Hey, you're the one who needs to go up there.
→ {"text": "我曾因射擊技術獲獎，所以我贏過一些射擊比賽，因此他們說：『嘿，你就是需要升空的那個人。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. You're the one who needs to chase this thing."
→ {"text": "你就是需要去追那東西的人。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. I just don't want you to be quite so humble in the way you're explaining this, please, because it took a little too long to say, "Hey, he wouldn't really have missed this."
→ {"text": "我只是希望您在解釋這件事時不要太過謙遜，因為花了太多時間才說出『嘿，他其實不可能會射偏的。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. Now, he didn't say it that way.
→ {"text": "當然，他沒有那樣說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. He said it more carefully, but there's no question you wouldn't have missed it based on everything you said, and based on how those 30 caliber shells, as you've described, would have taken out a truck.
→ {"text": "他說得更謹慎一些，但根據您所說的一切，毫無疑問您不可能射偏，而且根據您描述的30毫米炮彈的威力，足以摧毀一輛卡車。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. I mean, you didn't even have to be a great shot, but they picked you because of your ability to shoot at something they were worried about, coming in on the air base.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，您甚至不需要是神射手，但他們選中您是看重您的射擊能力，因為他們擔心有東西正在接近空軍基地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. Am I correct?
→ {"text": "我說得對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. And I want you to continue with your answer, as far as what happened after you shot the way you did at it.
→ {"text": "而且我希望您繼續回答，說明您以那種方式開火之後發生了什麼事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. Well, so I shot these birds, in our training, we are always firing on a three meter by three meter target, and in this case, this was a 10 meter by 10 meter objective target, so the possibility of missing was zero.
→ {"text": "嗯，在我的訓練中，我們總是瞄準3公尺乘3公尺的靶子射擊，而在這次事件中，目標是10公尺乘10公尺大小，所以射偏的可能性是零。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. These hit the object, and when it started to move away, I put on my post combustion so that I could chase it to maneuver, to try to get in position, but it's this mental exercise of how am I going to do this, and when it was moving away, I thought, how is it doing this?
→ {"text": "這些炮彈擊中了目標，當它開始移動時，我啟動了後燃器以便追擊並進行機動，試圖取得有利位置，但這是一個思考過程：我該怎麼做？當它移動時，我心想：它是怎麼做到的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. How can I better attack it, so I tried different positions until it came to the point when it had supersonic speed, when it would go up, I tried to get in my sights vertically, but when I moved to the side of the UFO at 1.3 mach, the UFO which was stopped, it achieved 1.2 mach in a question of seconds without any engines.
→ {"text": "我該如何更好地攻擊它？所以我嘗試了不同的位置，直到它達到超音速，當它上升時，我試圖垂直瞄準，但當我以1.3馬赫的速度移動到不明飛行物側面時，那個原本靜止的不明飛行物在幾秒鐘內就達到了1.2馬赫，而且沒有任何引擎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. This is something that no craft can do, to just go from 0 to 1.2 mach vertically to reach my same position, this is a UFO that knew the way our aircraft worked, because it was able to anticipate my moves and then follow me, and then once I landed, I met with intelligence officers, and we looked at all catalogs to see what possible spy objects this might have been, but they all had some type of engine, there was nothing similar to what I had observed.
→ {"text": "這是任何飛行器都做不到的，從靜止垂直加速到1.2馬赫到達我的位置，這個不明飛行物知道我們飛機的運作方式，因為它能預測我的動作並跟隨我。降落後，我與情報官員會面，我們查閱了所有目錄，看看這可能是什麼間諜飛行器，但它們都有某種引擎，沒有任何東西與我所觀察到的相似。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. So this was an unidentified object, and we were unaware of any type of technology on earth that existed.
→ {"text": "所以這是一個不明物體，我們不知道地球上有任何現存技術能做到這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. Will you allow me to make a comment?
→ {"text": "請允許我發表一些意見好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. Please Dr. Choy, I'd like to hear Dr. Choy's, since you're from Peru of course.
→ {"text": "請說，Choy博士，我想聽聽Choy博士的意見，因為您當然是來自祕魯的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文Troy為轉錄錯誤，應為Choy"}

337. Thank you very much, perhaps because the commander is so humble, he has not expressed certain details, but I wanted to share something that I believe that you should know and I should underscore.
→ {"text": "非常感謝，也許因為指揮官非常謙遜，他沒有表達某些細節，但我想分享一些我認為您應該知道、而且我應該強調的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. I would ask the, if I could interrupt you for one moment, I would ask the colonel to nod his head yes on any detail where I'm, either yes or no, just to be sure that he's, because I agree, one of the problems is you have a, not a problem in my opinion, but you have somebody that does not like to in any way bring attention to himself or overstate his own abilities or what he did when he, just description, denied by our Joint Chiefs of Staff was amazing.
→ {"text": "如果可以打斷您一下，我想請上校在我說的任何細節上點頭表示是或否，只是為了確認，因為我同意，問題之一是——在我看來這不是問題——您面對的是一位不喜歡以任何方式引起注意或誇大自己能力的人，而他被參謀長聯席會議否認的描述實在令人驚嘆。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "此句結構較複雜，需確認語意準確性"}

339. I just want him to confirm what you say because I do want to believe that it would be useful this panel to have him acknowledge anything you say that wouldn't add to that.
→ {"text": "我只是希望他能確認您所說的內容，因為我確實相信，讓他認同您所說的任何補充內容，對這個委員會會很有幫助。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

340. One of the things that we have heard in previous days is the possibility that many of these UFO events are due to earthly craft, but in the case of Colonel Santa Maria, we can prove that this was not anything, any technology we see here on earth.
→ {"text": "前幾天我們聽到的一個說法是，許多不明飛行物事件可能是由地球飛行器造成的，但在聖瑪利亞上校的案例中，我們可以證明這不是地球上任何現有技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. In the military terminology, there was a wall of fire basically that he came up, that this object came up against.
→ {"text": "用軍事術語來說，這個物體遭遇的基本上是一面火牆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. There's nothing on earth that could defend itself against that specifically in that time, not even up to today, not because it was able to only defend itself, but as the colonel stated, well you asked him what was the impact that it had on that, it actually, there was no impact.
→ {"text": "當時地球上沒有任何東西能夠抵擋那樣的攻擊，即使到現在也沒有。不是因為它只能自保，而是正如上校所說的，您問他造成了什麼影響，實際上，根本沒有影響。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. It absorbed all of these rounds.
→ {"text": "它吸收了所有這些炮彈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. It actually absorbed it.
→ {"text": "它確實吸收了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. That is absolutely impossible for any earth or any technology that we have here on earth to be able to absorb that type of barrage.
→ {"text": "對於地球上任何技術來說，能夠吸收那種程度的彈幕攻擊是絕對不可能的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. If I could interrupt you for just a moment and say, do you agree with the two or three important points there that Dr. Troy just made?
→ {"text": "如果可以打斷您一下，請問您是否同意Choy博士剛才提出的兩三個重要觀點？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文Troy為轉錄錯誤，應為Choy"}

347. Yes, I do agree because over time we have talked about the possible situations and the different perspectives that exist.
→ {"text": "是的，我同意，因為隨著時間推移，我們討論過可能存在的情況和不同的觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. Obviously I fired, and there should have been some sort of impact, but there was nothing.
→ {"text": "顯然我開火了，本應該有某種撞擊效果，但什麼都沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. There was no, the bullets didn't even explode.
→ {"text": "沒有，炮彈甚至沒有爆炸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. There was no explosion of the barrage of what I was firing, so it just absorbed it.
→ {"text": "我發射的彈幕沒有發生爆炸，所以它只是吸收了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. Okay, thank you very much, and I'd love to continue with this, but I do need to ask another question here with just a minute on my time left.
→ {"text": "好的，非常感謝，我很想繼續討論這個話題，但我只剩一分鐘了，需要問另一個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

352. We have one minute left.
→ {"text": "我們還剩一分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. That's right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. That's what I said.
→ {"text": "我就是這麼說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. I'd like to go over here to Mr., excuse me, Colonel Sanchez.
→ {"text": "我想請這邊的……抱歉，Sanchez上校。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. Your system in Uruguay that apparently has been in existence for 33 years, you say, that it's a track, and keep track of anything that's cited, it's called, I can't remember the operation name of it, or the, excuse me, let me grab my notes, I'm so mesmerized by the previous testimony, but the system you have where you outline the five or six steps to even get qualified to be seriously looked at, and then tracked as far as any UFO sightings that your organization in Uruguay keeps track of, do you have records of things similar to what we've just been talking about with Colonel Santa Maria, and I'm not sure if Peru and Europe, they do have the same language, don't they, or you obviously heard everything anyway, but through these translations, so I'd like to know anything that might be in that, that kind of talks about this sort of thing, and since I'll be out of time, if you keep your
→ {"text": "您說烏拉圭的系統已經存在33年了，用來追蹤任何被通報的事件，我記不得它的名稱了……抱歉，讓我看看筆記，剛才的證詞太令人著迷了。您建立的系統設定了五六個步驟，才能被認真看待和追蹤，您們在烏拉圭的組織記錄的任何不明飛行物目擊事件中，是否有類似我們剛才談到的聖瑪利亞上校那樣的記錄？我不確定祕魯和歐洲是否使用同一種語言，但顯然您們透過翻譯都聽到了一切。所以我想知道您的記錄中是否有談論這類事情的內容，由於我快沒時間了，如果您能保持……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. answer somewhat short, but. Yes, we for the last 33 years have had an Air Force commission that also is accountable to the public on all issues dealing with UFOs. This commission also has military and civilian members, and also does have archives of 1300 cases that had been investigated, 3% of which, there are 39 or 40 cases now that have not been solved because of the level of bizarreness that they presented, and Uruguay has scientifically addressed the UFO issue and does not rule out the extraterrestrial element, but for this we do need scientific evidence. We do have cases, such as that which Colonel Santa Maria mentioned, and how fighter jets were scrambled to chase these objects, and how there was a chase, an in-air chase, and following glowing objects, and sometimes they would get close to, and how these objects would get close to air bases throughout Latin America.
→ {"text": "回答簡短一些。是的，在過去33年裡，我們一直有一個空軍委員會，負責向公眾說明所有與不明飛行物相關的問題。這個委員會也有軍方和民間成員，並保存了1300個調查案例的檔案，其中3%——也就是39或40個案例——由於其呈現的奇異程度至今未能解決。烏拉圭以科學方式處理不明飛行物問題，不排除外星因素，但這需要科學證據。我們確實有類似聖瑪利亞上校提到的案例，戰鬥機緊急升空追逐這些物體，進行空中追逐，追蹤發光物體，有時它們會靠近，以及這些物體如何靠近拉丁美洲各地的空軍基地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. Thank you. A wise course, by the way. Thank you. Trust but verify. Senator. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。順便說一句，這是明智的做法。謝謝。信任但要驗證。參議員。謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
