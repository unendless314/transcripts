## Speaker Group 1

432. Thank you. I would like to hear from each one of you.

433. What's the attitude here? It is, well, if you believe in unidentified fine objects or you believe that there's spacecraft that comes in, there's been such a damper by both the press and our government about believing this. I mean, you're sort of made fun of if you look at this and say, "Yes, this is real." What's the attitude of both the people and your press? We'll start with Mr. Gevaerd. Thank you. This is definitely not a matter of belief. There is a lot of data that has been produced by civilian UFO researchers, military UFO researchers, very few but very dedicated scientists for the last 60 years to confirm without any question at all that we are being visited by several species of more advanced, at least technologically, more advanced civilization that come here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. And there's objects that they design, they construct like a Boeing does. It's Boeing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. It's airplanes here. They must have something like that in their planets. And they visit other planets in the universe. It is as simple as thinking what we are doing presently. We are at this very moment on Mars, on moon, taking photo of satellites, of Uranus, of the rings of Jupiter, of whatever. We are exploring our backyard. The difference is that our technology presently only allows us to explore this backyard. But if we're doing this now in 2013, in 20 years, in 30 years, in 50 years perhaps, we will be able to do interplanetary trips with crews inside our spaceships safely, effectively, go and come back. So if we can do this in the near future, and we're working on that definitely, this advanced civilization that started the evolutionary process much before us, they are doing the same. And they may have been doing the same for quite some time, perhaps
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. hundreds of years, thousands of years. We don't know. The universe is so full of life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. And the variety of this life in the formats and the levels of evolutionary process, it's just unthinkable for us at this point. But we are grasping the surface of this. We are doing history here. We are doing what we are supposed to do, to question and to whatever we find out, take to the society, make the society know that we are being visited. Because we may very well, at any point, receive their visitation in an open and frank way. And the world has to be prepared for that. It's not out of question that one day we will change, exchange with them, we'll engage, we'll live with other societies from other planets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. It's just a matter of time. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. Antonio? Yes. You're asking about the social attitude of the public and the press in Latin America. I would say, in general, it is much more open than in the United States. Whenever there is an important UFO case, it gets covered in mainstream newspapers. So it would be like here being covered by the Washington Post, by the New York Times, but seriously, or at least semi-seriously. There is some ridicule, of course, but not as bad as the US. The scientific community, on the other hand, has been very conservative, generally speaking, in Latin America. I would say that there might be more scientists quietly doing research in the US than in Latin America. Although that is changing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. Now that they see these official commissions, then that gives them some cover. If some general that is attached to the Civil Aviation Agency asks professors from the universities, then that gives them cover. But in the past, it was curious to see that the press and the general public and the governments were more open, but the scientific community was more closed. Interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. They were just afraid, maybe, because the peer pressure is always bad. In one thing that General Ben Mudez told me, which I found it very interesting, is that he said the pilots, the airline pilots, were very cautious. Normally, because in the past, airline pilots, they never wanted to report UFOs publicly, because it may affect their career. They don't want to be known as the UFO nut. So he said they're trying to condition them that it's okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. After all, this committee is from the Civil Aviation, and these are official forms. But he said it's easier for them from the military pilots, because if their commander tells a military pilot, "Here's a report, you fill the form," then officers follow orders, right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. But the airline pilots is still volunteer. But the fact that this agency is with the Civil Aviation, that is also changing. And of course, because they are with the Civil Aviation, that's their primary source of information. It usually comes from pilots who are, in the course of their flying, they're seeing something. They don't know if that is another air traffic or something else. So they will call the control tower, says, "Well, I see an object in that corner. Do you have any air traffic?" And then usually the control tower, well, in some cases they probably do, and then that's filed away, and it's not a UFO case. But in other cases, they don't. So then the control tower says, "No, we have no scheduled traffic there."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. And these communications are recorded and preserved. In the old days, probably they were erased after a while, but now they're preserved. And then there's official reporting forms that the committee gives them. But it is still up to airline pilots, that part is still volunteer, whether they want to fill the report or not. So they have to be conditioned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. Right. But they're being conditioned by the government. So hopefully that will change.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. Colonel Sanchez? Well, I wanted to tell you that the Uruguayan Air Force does not rule out the hypothesis that these are extraterrestrials. This phenomenon is one that we've seen occur in Uruguayan airspace. It could be different probes, something else, but we need scientific evidence to prove it. That's why our commission works using scientific methodologies, but we do so through the Air Force. I believe that people's attitude and the media's attitude in Uruguay are very respectful, given the fact that for 33 years, the Air Force has been spearheading UFO investigations in Uruguay. And so I believe that the Uruguayan people have reliable and transparent official information and understand that. The situation in each country is different. In the case of Brazil, United States, these are massive countries with large tracts of land and very sophisticated defense systems. It's not the
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. same in Uruguay. Uruguay doesn't develop weapons. We don't have special aeronautic or space research. So I think that's why there's greater acceptance. However, in the case of the United States, it's something that we all know. Defense is very important, and so they have to keep some secrets when it comes to sharing information. I've heard people mention over these days that these UFOs could be a new prototype of an unmanned aircraft, and that might make things difficult for the Department of Defense or especially for companies that build these, you know, Lockheed or Boeing. And that's why I believe that there are greater reservations, and I think that that's natural in terms of sharing information in terms of what's been flying around out there. That's at least my personal opinion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. Thank you very much. Yes. Yes, you were talking about believing or not in UFOs. I support what our colleague from Brazil said. It's not a matter of belief. It's a matter of information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. The information is out there, and over these five days we've been talking about it very openly. However, and I'm struck by how this is addressed in the United States. They underscore the fact that these civilizations are potentially aggressive, you know, the nuclear aspects of this. That's very interesting, because we don't look at it that way. It seems like there might be politically correct extraterrestrials, you know, because they might be offensive in some way. But in Peru, when we hear about cases of encounters, we have very credible testimony of people who've had contact in many different cases. But it's always been with civilizations where there have been attempts made at engaging and having communication.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. If you look at the case of Santa Maria, where there was this "clash" and where all of the ammo was fired, you would expect a response from the others. But there was none. It seemed like it was like a cat and mouse game. And if they wanted to destroy it, they would, clearly with their technology, they would have been able to do that, and they haven't done it. So I think our approach is very different. It's not, we look at superior technology, not in military framework, but there are many visits that we are receiving. We have to look at it. Unfortunately, this is, we haven't been able to explain it scientifically yet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. Thank you very much for your comments. Colonel?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. Yes. Just with respect for how the media treats us when there's a UFO case, I've worked with many airlines and crews. And I would say that starting in the 90s, pilots talk very openly about experiences that they've had, what they've seen, what they've heard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. Because again, nobody makes fun of you or laughs at you. It's very normal now to talk about sightings, and that doesn't have any impact whatsoever on someone's career. And I'm very pleased that that's the case. In my experience with Argentina, I have three decades as a journalist, international, and I saw evolution. When I started, the media was more kind of, kind of, aseptic. It was hard to be interviewed. It was hard to kind of open this Pandora box of the subject. But I saw, all over the world, I've seen this changing. For example, with series of history channel, ancient aliens, or UFO hunters, the people is kind of totally more open. Today, for example, we are discovering planets similar to the Earth every day in the news. It's incredible how the astronomy and the exobiology is every day in your breakfast table in the newspaper. And that attitude also helped with the UFOs
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. too. And for example, regarding with the pilots, it's interesting how the Latin American pilots are so open. Every time I travel, I go to the cockpit to talk with the pilots, and the pilots have experiences different to the United States, who the pilots are more shy. And I say, "What happened? We have only activities out of the border and not here?" It's interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. See, and sometimes I feel ridiculous asking, but I always go also to the airline I travel in, United American Airlines. I say, "No, they don't talk too much." But I think it's a totally paradigm shift. It's a shift now in all levels of consciousness. And I think it's positive for the new generations. When I was growing up as a ufologist, yeah, my own family was kind of, "Oh, he liked these subjects." And they were not kind of accepting that, also the media. But I think it's totally a new hope for all of us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. Thank you very much. I think we have time for one question from each panel member, if you have one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. I have a question, and Dr. Choi was absolutely my straight man on this one. My question is to you, Colonel Santa Maria. There was a phenomena in the surprise that the object, the UFO did not, was not attacking back. And would you respond to that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. Yes, it was a peaceful attitude. When I began to attack it, it evaded the fire. But never did I feel a threat that it was going to respond by attacking me. It's simply when my fuel, it was out, I just approached it and saw that it was an object that was unknown to me. I just wanted to see what it was. And I had to turn my back to return to the base. I thought, I don't know, maybe it's going to start chasing me now. But nothing of the sort happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. Thank you. Representative Kilpatrick. Thank you, Madam Chair. To Colonel Sanchez and Dr.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. Choi, what kind of scientific information do you seek that would verify the phenomena?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. Well, we, in theory, have no idea what it is we're actually investigating. So we use scientific methods to conduct our investigations. I can say that in 1993 we saw two luminous spheres hovering over a field in the interior part of Uruguay, these luminous spheres that measured about 30 or 40 centimeters, no more than that. They left prints where scientifically through laboratory studies we saw a diminishment of phosphorus and zinc and magnesium. So samples were taken from where it had touched the soil. We saw there were eight different tracks there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. And again, there was a reduction in phosphorus, zinc, and magnesium. We continue to use scientific methods to investigate in an attempt to see if this was reminiscent of any type of other interaction we've seen because of the color, the energy. But we don't know because we don't have anything else to analyze. However, we continue to work on projects that have been underway for several years. We're working with Norway in an analysis of lights that have been seen hovering over Uruguay, over dams, in mountainous areas of rivers where there have been witnesses. We have photographs. We're trying to conduct a film and photographic analysis. And again, we're also working with Chile on this. We have a written agreement between the Uruguayan and the Chilean Air Force in the sharing of information and data.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. And Uruguay and Chile have a joint investigation on UFOs on Easter Island.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. In my particular case, when I was working with the Peruvian Air Force, I was cooperating with them in their UFO office. The focus was on serious formal scientific investigations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. We were given questionnaires that showed us how we were supposed to interview people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. Then we had to cross this information with weather, data, et cetera. But this morning I was talking about the Chulucan incident. We saw these spheres of light that moved intelligently because they interacted with the people. When people tried to approach, they saw the spheres approaching then going back to where they were. And so it defied conventional science.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. And we sought explanations. We investigated for three years. And so the only way of understanding this phenomenon, again, is escaped traditional scientific cannons, that it was possible that we had to look for new possibilities. And in a conference, I was saying that if it's 73 million light years away, how do you continue to analyze it? And in 2010, there was a home in Lima, the capital of Peru, where there was a phenomenon where things started flying, floating around, things exploded. And there was a cell phone from the house owner. It was found in another house. And 25 people saw how that particular cell phone disappeared from one house and appeared in another house. And it wasn't that it flew from one place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. It disappeared from point A and reappeared in point B. This is something like teleporting from science fiction. But it had witnesses. People call this paranormal phenomenon, which is almost like a cuss word in sciences. But we have to look at ways to try to understand these phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. Thank you. Representative Cook? Yes. Colonel Santamaria, I'd like to ask you, so that we can do due diligence on any possible other explanation or hologram explanation, for example, could you tell us what your Air Squad commander ordered you to do that day? How many people on the ground witnessed the globe, as you described it initially, as about 600 meters above the earth, at about five kilometers away from the base, and particularly interested in how long at speeds that you described as 1.6, up to 1.6 Mach speed, you did this, you kept this globe in your sights.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. When this balloon observed, there were 1,800 people who were in our morning formations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. And so they visually saw this globe. Radar had not detected it. And I was ready to fly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. And so I got the order that there's an object that's not responding to radio communications.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. It's not on the radar. We thought it might be spy equipment, and it was in restricted airspace for civilian flights. So I was given the order. This could be a spy object. And so I was given the order to pursue it. And so if it did not move away, I was supposed to engage it with fire. So 1,800 people witnessed it. But 400 people were in combat positions that if it started to attack, that they would intervene. So as I fired and it moved away from the base, the other 400 kept their position. They remained on standby. And they saw that it moved up in the air, and the object moved away. So I chased it. I think it was 1,800 people who saw this very clearly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. Senator.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. I have no further questions. I just want to congratulate the panel coming forward, because you've added a very unusual dimension to what we've been trying to prove. And that is that our government has not been straightforward with the American people. So thank you for helping us prove that case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. Representative Bartlett.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. Our chair has asked two-thirds of the question that I was anxious to ask. And the question I was going to ask was, would you tell us, just go down the line and tell us, the attitudes of your people, your press, and your military and government? And you've asked the question about the people and the press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. So let me just ask the question. I want just a one-word answer from you. Where your military and your government is on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is open and accepting and investigative, and 10 is denial and ridicule. Our country is pretty close to 10. Tell us on that scale where your countries are. Just a number.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. Just a number. Being 0 total openness and 10 total ridicule.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. Yeah, 1 or 0 total openness, right. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. I would say we are 3. 3? Pretty good. 2, 3.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

484. After this, the Iguachu forged the Iguachu letter and the recent meeting at the Ministry of Defense in Brazil two weeks ago, only two weeks ago, maybe we can go an update, an upgrade to 1.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. That's fantastic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. Well, I think that we have to distinguish between the recognition that the UFO phenomenon is real and the extraterrestrial hypothesis, because that's another step. So in the terms of the acceptance of UFOs as a real phenomenon, I mean, we have this statement from General Bermudez. Another important ufologist in Chile from the Army is Major Bravo, who was with the aviation branch of the Army. That would be a 0, a 1. They totally recognize that the UFO phenomenon is real. But the extraterrestrial hypothesis, that's another question, because then you would have to have a body or a piece of metal or something that really could be proven. So there, I don't know, they admit the possibility, but there I would say maybe a 6 or 7 as far as the ET part. But the UFO, total acceptance that it's a real phenomenon and that it may pose possibly a threat to aviation. And that is something that governments
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. should take seriously. Absolutely. In South America, that is accepted today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. The vision of Uruguay from the point of view of the Uruguayan Air Force is people, I would say, 0. Because Uruguay, through its Air Force and UFO Investigation Commission, even welcomed the idea of extraterrestrials as a possibility. However, there are 40 cases, again, that we've been unable to resolve because of how odd they are. And you have civilian pilots, military pilots that have chased these UFOs and have taken photographs. So I would say the openness in Uruguay means that people have a good image of what the information we're providing is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. They believe it's reliable. And again, we use scientific methods because there's no other way to do it from our point of view. And the groups that address UFOs, like spiritual groups, that are also working in investigating this accept what we are proposing. And we've even held a conference in 2012 where we invited all of the groups in Uruguay that do these investigations. I think people were very happy, and I think there was acceptance. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. Thank you, Congressman. Before giving my response, I would like to clearly state that I profoundly love my country, Peru, and I profoundly respect the armed forces of my country. In fact, they gave me the opportunity to work with them, and I profoundly admire the American people here as well. I want that to be very clear before I respond. What you're asking me is very complex, because at the moment when the Peruvian government decided to open this investigation office, they were admitting that there was a reality to this. They're not going to open an office on unicorns and ghosts. No, that's not what we're doing here. But on the other hand, this has been going on for 13 years, and we have seen minimal results. And when I talk to the military personnel, they say that they have seen UFOs, but they can't come out publicly and say because there is a policy that has not yet opened up. And so I would
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

492. say that that's why I couldn't give it a 10. But that would just be my response.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. The Argentina government doesn't pronounce the extraterrestrial hypothesis open, but in the history of our traditions, for example, in 1968, the president of Argentina, General Onganía, said, "I believe in the flying saucers." Yo creo en los platos voladores. That openness always exists. In that case, it was the president of a nation. But the government is investigating the UFOs with scientifically correctness in this moment. And in the future, maybe it will be some pronunciation. That is it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. I want to thank our panel for being here today. This has been really interesting, and your openness and what's happening in each of your countries has been, I think, a real eye-opener for the rest of us. And with that, I'm going to conclude this hearing. We will be back here at 1.45.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. Meeting adjourned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
