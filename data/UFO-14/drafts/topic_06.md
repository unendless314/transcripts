## Speaker Group 1

432. Thank you. I would like to hear from each one of you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。我想聽聽各位的意見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. What's the attitude here? It is, well, if you believe in unidentified fine objects or you believe that there's spacecraft that comes in, there's been such a damper by both the press and our government about believing this. I mean, you're sort of made fun of if you look at this and say, "Yes, this is real." What's the attitude of both the people and your press? We'll start with Mr. Gevaerd. Thank you. This is definitely not a matter of belief. There is a lot of data that has been produced by civilian UFO researchers, military UFO researchers, very few but very dedicated scientists for the last 60 years to confirm without any question at all that we are being visited by several species of more advanced, at least technologically, more advanced civilization that come here.
→ {"text": "這裡的態度是什麼？如果你相信不明飛行物，或者你相信有太空船來到這裡，我們的媒體和政府對於相信這件事一直採取打壓的態度。我的意思是，如果你說『是的，這是真的』，你就會被嘲笑。你們的人民和媒體對此的態度是什麼？我們先請蓋瓦德先生回答。謝謝。這絕對不是一個信仰的問題。在過去60年裡，民間不明飛行物研究者、軍方不明飛行物研究者，以及少數但非常敬業的科學家們，已經產生了大量數據，毫無疑問地證實我們正被多個物種、至少技術上更先進的文明所造訪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Mr. Gevaerd 為巴西證人 A.J. Gevaerd"}

434. And there's objects that they design, they construct like a Boeing does. It's Boeing.
→ {"text": "他們設計和建造這些物體，就像波音公司製造飛機一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. It's airplanes here. They must have something like that in their planets. And they visit other planets in the universe. It is as simple as thinking what we are doing presently. We are at this very moment on Mars, on moon, taking photo of satellites, of Uranus, of the rings of Jupiter, of whatever. We are exploring our backyard. The difference is that our technology presently only allows us to explore this backyard. But if we're doing this now in 2013, in 20 years, in 30 years, in 50 years perhaps, we will be able to do interplanetary trips with crews inside our spaceships safely, effectively, go and come back. So if we can do this in the near future, and we're working on that definitely, this advanced civilization that started the evolutionary process much before us, they are doing the same. And they may have been doing the same for quite some time, perhaps
→ {"text": "我們這裡製造飛機。他們在他們的星球上一定也有類似的東西。而且他們會造訪宇宙中的其他星球。這就像思考我們現在正在做的事情一樣簡單。就在此時此刻，我們正在火星上、在月球上，拍攝衛星、天王星、木星環等的照片。我們正在探索我們的後院。不同之處在於，我們目前的技術只允許我們探索這個後院。但如果我們現在在2013年能做到這一點，20年後、30年後、也許50年後，我們將能夠安全有效地進行星際旅行，載著船員乘坐太空船往返。所以如果不久的將來我們能做到這一點，而且我們肯定正在為此努力，那麼這個比我們早開始進化過程許多的先進文明，他們也在做同樣的事。而且他們可能已經這樣做相當長一段時間了，也許", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. hundreds of years, thousands of years. We don't know. The universe is so full of life.
→ {"text": "數百年、數千年。我們不知道。宇宙充滿了生命。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. And the variety of this life in the formats and the levels of evolutionary process, it's just unthinkable for us at this point. But we are grasping the surface of this. We are doing history here. We are doing what we are supposed to do, to question and to whatever we find out, take to the society, make the society know that we are being visited. Because we may very well, at any point, receive their visitation in an open and frank way. And the world has to be prepared for that. It's not out of question that one day we will change, exchange with them, we'll engage, we'll live with other societies from other planets.
→ {"text": "這種生命的形式多樣性和進化程度層次，目前對我們來說是不可想像的。但我們正在觸及這個問題的表面。我們正在創造歷史。我們正在做我們應該做的事情，提出質疑，並將我們發現的一切帶給社會，讓社會知道我們正在被造訪。因為我們很可能在任何時候，以公開坦誠的方式接受他們的造訪。世界必須為此做好準備。有一天我們會與他們交流、互動，與來自其他星球的社會共處，這並非不可能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. It's just a matter of time. Thank you.
→ {"text": "這只是時間問題。謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. Antonio? Yes. You're asking about the social attitude of the public and the press in Latin America. I would say, in general, it is much more open than in the United States. Whenever there is an important UFO case, it gets covered in mainstream newspapers. So it would be like here being covered by the Washington Post, by the New York Times, but seriously, or at least semi-seriously. There is some ridicule, of course, but not as bad as the US. The scientific community, on the other hand, has been very conservative, generally speaking, in Latin America. I would say that there might be more scientists quietly doing research in the US than in Latin America. Although that is changing.
→ {"text": "安東尼奧？是的。您問的是拉丁美洲公眾和媒體的社會態度。總的來說，我會說比美國開放得多。每當有重要的不明飛行物案件，主流報紙都會報導。就像這裡的《華盛頓郵報》、《紐約時報》報導一樣，認真地，或至少是半認真地報導。當然也有一些嘲笑，但不像美國那麼嚴重。另一方面，科學界在拉丁美洲一直非常保守。我想美國可能有更多科學家在悄悄進行研究，比拉丁美洲還多。雖然這種情況正在改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Antonio 指智利證人 Antonio Huneeus"}

440. Now that they see these official commissions, then that gives them some cover. If some general that is attached to the Civil Aviation Agency asks professors from the universities, then that gives them cover. But in the past, it was curious to see that the press and the general public and the governments were more open, but the scientific community was more closed. Interesting.
→ {"text": "現在他們看到這些官方委員會，這給了他們一些掩護。如果民航局附屬的某位將軍向大學教授提出請求，這會給他們提供掩護。但在過去，有趣的是，媒體、普通大眾和政府更為開放，但科學界卻較為封閉。這很有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. They were just afraid, maybe, because the peer pressure is always bad. In one thing that General Ben Mudez told me, which I found it very interesting, is that he said the pilots, the airline pilots, were very cautious. Normally, because in the past, airline pilots, they never wanted to report UFOs publicly, because it may affect their career. They don't want to be known as the UFO nut. So he said they're trying to condition them that it's okay.
→ {"text": "也許他們只是害怕，因為同儕壓力總是很糟糕。貝爾穆德斯將軍告訴我的一件事，我覺得很有意思，他說飛行員，民航飛行員，非常謹慎。通常，因為在過去，民航飛行員從不想公開報告不明飛行物，因為這可能影響他們的職業生涯。他們不想被稱為不明飛行物狂熱者。所以他說他們正在努力讓飛行員相信這樣做是可以的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "General Ben Mudez 應為 General Bermúdez（貝爾穆德斯將軍）"}

442. After all, this committee is from the Civil Aviation, and these are official forms. But he said it's easier for them from the military pilots, because if their commander tells a military pilot, "Here's a report, you fill the form," then officers follow orders, right?
→ {"text": "畢竟，這個委員會隸屬於民航局，這些都是官方表格。但他說對於軍方飛行員來說比較容易，因為如果他們的指揮官告訴軍方飛行員：『這裡有一份報告，你填寫表格』，那麼軍官就會服從命令，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. But the airline pilots is still volunteer. But the fact that this agency is with the Civil Aviation, that is also changing. And of course, because they are with the Civil Aviation, that's their primary source of information. It usually comes from pilots who are, in the course of their flying, they're seeing something. They don't know if that is another air traffic or something else. So they will call the control tower, says, "Well, I see an object in that corner. Do you have any air traffic?" And then usually the control tower, well, in some cases they probably do, and then that's filed away, and it's not a UFO case. But in other cases, they don't. So then the control tower says, "No, we have no scheduled traffic there."
→ {"text": "但民航飛行員仍然是自願的。但這個機構隸屬於民航局的事實，這也正在改變。當然，因為他們隸屬於民航局，這是他們的主要資訊來源。通常來自飛行員，在他們飛行過程中，他們看到了某些東西。他們不知道那是其他空中交通還是別的東西。所以他們會呼叫塔台，說：『嗯，我在那個角落看到一個物體。你們有空中交通嗎？』然後通常塔台，在某些情況下他們可能有，那就存檔了，這不是不明飛行物案件。但在其他情況下，他們沒有。所以塔台會說：『不，我們在那裡沒有排定的航班。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. And these communications are recorded and preserved. In the old days, probably they were erased after a while, but now they're preserved. And then there's official reporting forms that the committee gives them. But it is still up to airline pilots, that part is still volunteer, whether they want to fill the report or not. So they have to be conditioned.
→ {"text": "這些通訊都被記錄並保存。在過去，可能一段時間後就被刪除了，但現在都被保存下來。然後委員會會給他們官方報告表格。但這仍然取決於民航飛行員，這部分仍然是自願的，他們是否想填寫報告。所以他們必須被引導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. Right. But they're being conditioned by the government. So hopefully that will change.
→ {"text": "是的。但他們正在被政府引導。所以希望這會改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. Colonel Sanchez? Well, I wanted to tell you that the Uruguayan Air Force does not rule out the hypothesis that these are extraterrestrials. This phenomenon is one that we've seen occur in Uruguayan airspace. It could be different probes, something else, but we need scientific evidence to prove it. That's why our commission works using scientific methodologies, but we do so through the Air Force. I believe that people's attitude and the media's attitude in Uruguay are very respectful, given the fact that for 33 years, the Air Force has been spearheading UFO investigations in Uruguay. And so I believe that the Uruguayan people have reliable and transparent official information and understand that. The situation in each country is different. In the case of Brazil, United States, these are massive countries with large tracts of land and very sophisticated defense systems. It's not the
→ {"text": "桑切斯上校？我想告訴您，烏拉圭空軍不排除這些是外星人的假說。這種現象是我們在烏拉圭領空看到發生的。可能是不同的探測器，或其他東西，但我們需要科學證據來證明。這就是為什麼我們的委員會使用科學方法進行調查，但我們是通過空軍來做的。我相信烏拉圭人民的態度和媒體的態度非常尊重，考慮到33年來，空軍一直在烏拉圭主導不明飛行物調查。所以我相信烏拉圭人民擁有可靠和透明的官方資訊並理解這一點。每個國家的情況不同。就巴西、美國而言，這些是幅員遼闊的大國，擁有非常大片的土地和非常複雜的防禦系統。這不一樣", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Colonel Sanchez 為烏拉圭證人"}

447. same in Uruguay. Uruguay doesn't develop weapons. We don't have special aeronautic or space research. So I think that's why there's greater acceptance. However, in the case of the United States, it's something that we all know. Defense is very important, and so they have to keep some secrets when it comes to sharing information. I've heard people mention over these days that these UFOs could be a new prototype of an unmanned aircraft, and that might make things difficult for the Department of Defense or especially for companies that build these, you know, Lockheed or Boeing. And that's why I believe that there are greater reservations, and I think that that's natural in terms of sharing information in terms of what's been flying around out there. That's at least my personal opinion.
→ {"text": "在烏拉圭。烏拉圭不發展武器。我們沒有特殊的航空或太空研究。所以我認為這就是為什麼接受度更高。然而，就美國而言，這是我們都知道的事情。國防非常重要，所以他們在分享資訊時必須保守一些秘密。這幾天我聽到人們提到，這些不明飛行物可能是一種新型無人機原型，這可能會讓國防部或特別是製造這些飛機的公司，比如洛克希德或波音，感到困難。這就是為什麼我認為存在更大的保留，而且我認為在分享有關那裡飛行物的資訊方面，這是很自然的。這至少是我個人的看法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. Thank you very much. Yes. Yes, you were talking about believing or not in UFOs. I support what our colleague from Brazil said. It's not a matter of belief. It's a matter of information.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。是的。是的，您剛才談到是否相信不明飛行物。我支持我們巴西同事所說的。這不是信仰的問題，而是資訊的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. The information is out there, and over these five days we've been talking about it very openly. However, and I'm struck by how this is addressed in the United States. They underscore the fact that these civilizations are potentially aggressive, you know, the nuclear aspects of this. That's very interesting, because we don't look at it that way. It seems like there might be politically correct extraterrestrials, you know, because they might be offensive in some way. But in Peru, when we hear about cases of encounters, we have very credible testimony of people who've had contact in many different cases. But it's always been with civilizations where there have been attempts made at engaging and having communication.
→ {"text": "資訊就在那裡，在這五天裡我們一直在非常公開地談論這個問題。然而，讓我震驚的是美國處理這個問題的方式。他們強調這些文明可能具有侵略性，您知道，涉及核方面的問題。這很有意思，因為我們不是這樣看待的。似乎可能存在政治正確的外星人，您知道，因為他們可能以某種方式具有攻擊性。但在秘魯，當我們聽到接觸案例時，我們有非常可信的證詞，許多不同案例中都有人接觸過。但這總是與那些試圖接觸和溝通的文明有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. If you look at the case of Santa Maria, where there was this "clash" and where all of the ammo was fired, you would expect a response from the others. But there was none. It seemed like it was like a cat and mouse game. And if they wanted to destroy it, they would, clearly with their technology, they would have been able to do that, and they haven't done it. So I think our approach is very different. It's not, we look at superior technology, not in military framework, but there are many visits that we are receiving. We have to look at it. Unfortunately, this is, we haven't been able to explain it scientifically yet.
→ {"text": "如果您看看聖瑪利亞的案例，那裡發生了這場『衝突』，所有彈藥都發射了，您會預期對方會有回應。但沒有。這看起來像是一場貓捉老鼠的遊戲。如果他們想摧毀它，他們會的，顯然以他們的技術，他們本來能夠做到，但他們沒有這樣做。所以我認為我們的態度非常不同。我們看待先進技術，不是從軍事框架出發，而是我們正在接收到許多造訪。我們必須正視這個問題。不幸的是，我們至今還無法從科學上解釋它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Santa Maria 指聖瑪利亞上校1980年的UFO遭遇事件"}

451. Thank you very much for your comments. Colonel?
→ {"text": "非常感謝您的評論。上校？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. Yes. Just with respect for how the media treats us when there's a UFO case, I've worked with many airlines and crews. And I would say that starting in the 90s, pilots talk very openly about experiences that they've had, what they've seen, what they've heard.
→ {"text": "是的。關於媒體如何報導不明飛行物案件，我與許多航空公司和機組人員合作過。我要說的是，從90年代開始，飛行員非常公開地談論他們的經歷，他們看到的、聽到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. Because again, nobody makes fun of you or laughs at you. It's very normal now to talk about sightings, and that doesn't have any impact whatsoever on someone's career. And I'm very pleased that that's the case. In my experience with Argentina, I have three decades as a journalist, international, and I saw evolution. When I started, the media was more kind of, kind of, aseptic. It was hard to be interviewed. It was hard to kind of open this Pandora box of the subject. But I saw, all over the world, I've seen this changing. For example, with series of history channel, ancient aliens, or UFO hunters, the people is kind of totally more open. Today, for example, we are discovering planets similar to the Earth every day in the news. It's incredible how the astronomy and the exobiology is every day in your breakfast table in the newspaper. And that attitude also helped with the UFOs
→ {"text": "因為同樣地，沒有人會嘲笑你。現在談論目擊事件是很正常的，這對任何人的職業生涯都沒有任何影響。我很高興情況是這樣。以我在阿根廷的經驗，我當了三十年的國際記者，我看到了演變。當我開始的時候，媒體比較冷淡。很難接受採訪。很難打開這個話題的潘朵拉盒子。但我看到，在全世界，我看到這正在改變。例如，隨著歷史頻道的系列節目《遠古外星人》或《UFO獵人》，人們變得更加開放。例如今天，我們每天都在新聞中發現與地球相似的行星。令人難以置信的是，天文學和外太空生物學每天都出現在您早餐桌上的報紙裡。這種態度也幫助了不明飛行物", "confidence": "high", "notes": "ancient aliens 譯為《遠古外星人》，exobiology 譯為外太空生物學"}


454. too. And for example, regarding with the pilots, it's interesting how the Latin American pilots are so open. Every time I travel, I go to the cockpit to talk with the pilots, and the pilots have experiences different to the United States, who the pilots are more shy. And I say, "What happened? We have only activities out of the border and not here?" It's interesting.
→ {"text": "的議題。例如，關於飛行員，有趣的是拉丁美洲的飛行員如此開放。每次我旅行時，我都會去駕駛艙和飛行員交談，這些飛行員的經歷與美國不同，美國的飛行員比較害羞。我會說：『怎麼回事？我們只有在邊境外才有活動，這裡沒有嗎？』這很有意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. See, and sometimes I feel ridiculous asking, but I always go also to the airline I travel in, United American Airlines. I say, "No, they don't talk too much." But I think it's a totally paradigm shift. It's a shift now in all levels of consciousness. And I think it's positive for the new generations. When I was growing up as a ufologist, yeah, my own family was kind of, "Oh, he liked these subjects." And they were not kind of accepting that, also the media. But I think it's totally a new hope for all of us.
→ {"text": "看，有時候我覺得問這個問題很可笑，但我總是會去我搭乘的航空公司，聯合航空或美國航空。我說：『不，他們不太願意談。』但我認為這是一場完全的典範轉移。現在在各個意識層面都在轉變。我認為這對新一代來說是正面的。當我作為一名幽浮學家成長時，是的，我自己的家人會說：『哦，他喜歡這些主題。』他們不太接受，媒體也是。但我認為這對我們所有人來說是一個全新的希望。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "paradigm shift 譯為典範轉移"}

456. Thank you very much. I think we have time for one question from each panel member, if you have one.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。我想我們有時間讓每位小組成員提出一個問題，如果您有的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. I have a question, and Dr. Choi was absolutely my straight man on this one. My question is to you, Colonel Santa Maria. There was a phenomena in the surprise that the object, the UFO did not, was not attacking back. And would you respond to that?
→ {"text": "我有一個問題，蔡伊博士在這個問題上絕對是我的好搭檔。我的問題是給您的，聖瑪利亞上校。有一個令人驚訝的現象，那個物體，不明飛行物沒有，沒有反擊。您能回應一下嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "straight man 在此指喜劇中的搭檔／捧哏角色；Dr. Choi 應為 Dr. Choy（蔡伊博士）"}

458. Yes, it was a peaceful attitude. When I began to attack it, it evaded the fire. But never did I feel a threat that it was going to respond by attacking me. It's simply when my fuel, it was out, I just approached it and saw that it was an object that was unknown to me. I just wanted to see what it was. And I had to turn my back to return to the base. I thought, I don't know, maybe it's going to start chasing me now. But nothing of the sort happened.
→ {"text": "是的，那是一種和平的態度。當我開始攻擊它時，它躲開了火力。但我從未感到它會以攻擊來回應的威脅。只是當我的燃料耗盡時，我靠近它，看到那是一個我不認識的物體。我只是想看看它是什麼。我不得不轉身返回基地。我想，我不知道，也許它現在要開始追我了。但這種事情完全沒有發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. Thank you. Representative Kilpatrick. Thank you, Madam Chair. To Colonel Sanchez and Dr.
→ {"text": "謝謝。基爾帕特里克議員。謝謝，主席女士。請問桑切斯上校和", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. Choi, what kind of scientific information do you seek that would verify the phenomena?
→ {"text": "蔡伊博士，您尋求什麼樣的科學資訊來驗證這個現象？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Choi 應為 Choy（蔡伊博士）"}

461. Well, we, in theory, have no idea what it is we're actually investigating. So we use scientific methods to conduct our investigations. I can say that in 1993 we saw two luminous spheres hovering over a field in the interior part of Uruguay, these luminous spheres that measured about 30 or 40 centimeters, no more than that. They left prints where scientifically through laboratory studies we saw a diminishment of phosphorus and zinc and magnesium. So samples were taken from where it had touched the soil. We saw there were eight different tracks there.
→ {"text": "嗯，理論上，我們根本不知道我們實際上在調查什麼。所以我們使用科學方法進行調查。我可以說，1993年我們在烏拉圭內陸地區的一片田野上空看到兩個發光球體，這些發光球體大約30或40公分，不超過這個尺寸。它們留下了痕跡，通過實驗室研究我們科學地看到磷、鋅和鎂的減少。所以我們從它接觸土壤的地方採集了樣本。我們看到那裡有八個不同的痕跡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. And again, there was a reduction in phosphorus, zinc, and magnesium. We continue to use scientific methods to investigate in an attempt to see if this was reminiscent of any type of other interaction we've seen because of the color, the energy. But we don't know because we don't have anything else to analyze. However, we continue to work on projects that have been underway for several years. We're working with Norway in an analysis of lights that have been seen hovering over Uruguay, over dams, in mountainous areas of rivers where there have been witnesses. We have photographs. We're trying to conduct a film and photographic analysis. And again, we're also working with Chile on this. We have a written agreement between the Uruguayan and the Chilean Air Force in the sharing of information and data.
→ {"text": "同樣地，磷、鋅和鎂都減少了。我們繼續使用科學方法進行調查，試圖看看這是否讓我們想起因為顏色、能量而見過的任何其他類型的互動。但我們不知道，因為我們沒有其他東西可以分析。然而，我們繼續進行已經進行了好幾年的項目。我們正在與挪威合作分析在烏拉圭上空、水壩上空、河流山區出現的光，那裡有目擊者。我們有照片。我們正在嘗試進行影片和照片分析。同樣地，我們也在與智利合作。我們有烏拉圭和智利空軍之間關於資訊和數據共享的書面協議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. And Uruguay and Chile have a joint investigation on UFOs on Easter Island.
→ {"text": "烏拉圭和智利在復活節島上有一項關於不明飛行物的聯合調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. In my particular case, when I was working with the Peruvian Air Force, I was cooperating with them in their UFO office. The focus was on serious formal scientific investigations.
→ {"text": "就我個人而言，當我在秘魯空軍工作時，我與他們在他們的不明飛行物辦公室合作。重點是嚴肅的正式科學調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. We were given questionnaires that showed us how we were supposed to interview people.
→ {"text": "我們得到了問卷，告訴我們應該如何訪談人們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. Then we had to cross this information with weather, data, et cetera. But this morning I was talking about the Chulucan incident. We saw these spheres of light that moved intelligently because they interacted with the people. When people tried to approach, they saw the spheres approaching then going back to where they were. And so it defied conventional science.
→ {"text": "然後我們必須將這些資訊與天氣、數據等交叉比對。但今天早上我在談論丘盧坎事件。我們看到這些光球以智慧方式移動，因為它們與人們互動。當人們試圖接近時，他們看到光球接近，然後又回到原來的位置。所以這違背了傳統科學。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Chulucan incident 譯為丘盧坎事件"}


467. And we sought explanations. We investigated for three years. And so the only way of understanding this phenomenon, again, is escaped traditional scientific cannons, that it was possible that we had to look for new possibilities. And in a conference, I was saying that if it's 73 million light years away, how do you continue to analyze it? And in 2010, there was a home in Lima, the capital of Peru, where there was a phenomenon where things started flying, floating around, things exploded. And there was a cell phone from the house owner. It was found in another house. And 25 people saw how that particular cell phone disappeared from one house and appeared in another house. And it wasn't that it flew from one place.
→ {"text": "我們尋求解釋。我們調查了三年。所以理解這種現象的唯一方式，再次強調，是超越傳統科學的範疇，我們必須尋找新的可能性。在一次會議上，我說如果它在7300萬光年之外，你怎麼繼續分析它？2010年，在秘魯首都利馬有一棟房子，那裡發生了一種現象，東西開始飛起來、漂浮，東西爆炸了。還有屋主的手機。它在另一棟房子裡被發現。25個人看到那支手機如何從一棟房子消失，然後出現在另一棟房子裡。它不是從一個地方飛過去的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. Thank you. Representative Cook? Yes. Colonel Santamaria, I'd like to ask you, so that we can do due diligence on any possible other explanation or hologram explanation, for example, could you tell us what your Air Squad commander ordered you to do that day? How many people on the ground witnessed the globe, as you described it initially, as about 600 meters above the earth, at about five kilometers away from the base, and particularly interested in how long at speeds that you described as 1.6, up to 1.6 Mach speed, you did this, you kept this globe in your sights.
→ {"text": "謝謝。庫克議員？是的。聖瑪利亞上校，我想問您，為了讓我們盡職調查任何其他可能的解釋或全息圖解釋，例如，您能告訴我們那天您的空軍中隊指揮官命令您做什麼嗎？有多少地面人員目擊了那個球體，正如您最初描述的，大約在離地面600公尺、距離基地約5公里的地方，我特別感興趣的是，以您所描述的1.6馬赫速度，您將這個球體保持在視線中多久。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "hologram 譯為全息圖，Mach 譯為馬赫"}

470. When this balloon observed, there were 1,800 people who were in our morning formations.

471. And so they visually saw this globe. Radar had not detected it. And I was ready to fly.
→ {"text": "所以他們親眼看到了這個球體。雷達沒有探測到它。我已經準備好起飛了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. And so I got the order that there's an object that's not responding to radio communications.
→ {"text": "於是我接到命令，說有一個物體沒有回應無線電通訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. It's not on the radar. We thought it might be spy equipment, and it was in restricted airspace for civilian flights. So I was given the order. This could be a spy object. And so I was given the order to pursue it. And so if it did not move away, I was supposed to engage it with fire. So 1,800 people witnessed it. But 400 people were in combat positions that if it started to attack, that they would intervene. So as I fired and it moved away from the base, the other 400 kept their position. They remained on standby. And they saw that it moved up in the air, and the object moved away. So I chased it. I think it was 1,800 people who saw this very clearly.

And you've asked the question about the people and the press.

487. Well, I think that we have to distinguish between the recognition that the UFO phenomenon is real and the extraterrestrial hypothesis, because that's another step. So in the terms of the acceptance of UFOs as a real phenomenon, I mean, we have this statement from General Bermudez. Another important ufologist in Chile from the Army is Major Bravo, who was with the aviation branch of the Army. That would be a 0, a 1. They totally recognize that the UFO phenomenon is real. But the extraterrestrial hypothesis, that's another question, because then you would have to have a body or a piece of metal or something that really could be proven. So there, I don't know, they admit the possibility, but there I would say maybe a 6 or 7 as far as the ET part. But the UFO, total acceptance that it's a real phenomenon and that it may pose possibly a threat to aviation. And that is something that governments

489. The vision of Uruguay from the point of view of the Uruguayan Air Force is people, I would say, 0. Because Uruguay, through its Air Force and UFO Investigation Commission, even welcomed the idea of extraterrestrials as a possibility. However, there are 40 cases, again, that we've been unable to resolve because of how odd they are. And you have civilian pilots, military pilots that have chased these UFOs and have taken photographs. So I would say the openness in Uruguay means that people have a good image of what the information we're providing is.

In fact, they gave me the opportunity to work with them, and I profoundly admire the American people here as well. I want that to be very clear before I respond. What you're asking me is very complex, because at the moment when the Peruvian government decided to open this investigation office, they were admitting that there was a reality to this. They're not going to open an office on unicorns and ghosts. No, that's not what we're doing here. But on the other hand, this has been going on for 13 years, and we have seen minimal results. And when I talk to the military personnel, they say that they have seen UFOs, but they can't come out publicly and say because there is a policy that has not yet opened up. And so I would

The Argentina government doesn't pronounce the extraterrestrial hypothesis open, but in the history of our traditions, for example, in 1968, the president of Argentina, General Onganía, said, "I believe in the flying saucers."
