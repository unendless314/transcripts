    books were written about him, one by a general from the Air Force Academy, his name was Colonel Leroy Gover, and he was
    one of the first 100 American pilots in World War II, he went over to Canada and then became commander of Eagle Squadron.

    him a copy of Colonel Corso's book, The Day After Roswell, and he said I don't know a whole lot about certain aspects
    of this book, if it's all true, but I can tell you from what I was involved with, the people I knew, because he was with
    the Army Air Corps which later the same year as the alleged incident in Roswell happened, the Air Force was formed along
    with the United Nations and other developments, but he confirmed that in his words, and I never heard this man lie, he
    said they were androgynous, they didn't know their full technological capabilities at that time, at least one of them
    survived, they didn't know their full psychological makeup, or where they were from, or what this was all about, this
    was at this time.

    who told you that they could take ET home, was he Looney Tunes, or was he a serious engineer, or was he just boasting

    laws of biology and so on, are probably incorrect.
