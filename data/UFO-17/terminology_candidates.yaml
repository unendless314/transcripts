    source_text: So what you really have to kind of take a look is maybe there's something
      beyond the theory of relativity, and what's faster than the speed of light,
      thought, from what I understand from scientists that have been involved with
      these projects is they've, they're thousands of years ahead of us, probably,
      and they've definitely used some kind of incredible thought process, some kind
      of inversion energy process to get here, and they basically warp time.

    source_text: There's probably either many other advanced craft that we've developed
      at some of these installations like 51 or Pine Gap in Australia, possibly, that
      do hover silently, and they can duplicate some of the technology, but we haven't
      been able to replicate it 100%.

    source_text: That sounds like an exaggeration to me, because if there's a company
      that's developed a propulsion system equal to what's been observed by all of
      our witnesses, and based upon Dr. Greer's testimony, we just alter life on this
      planet if that form of energy is known.

      States House of Representatives, read it, was real briefed on it, and thought
      it was a beginning.

      was God.

      the news this week, Airbus Aircraft British coming into Glasgow, Scotland, December
      2nd, and it just broke in the news yesterday or two days ago, and they were
      at 4,000 feet, and this disc-shaped thing came under them with, you know, strange
      lights and all that, and they never got any warning from their TCAS system or
      wasn't on radar.
