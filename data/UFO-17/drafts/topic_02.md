141. We've got a major filer who could ... Go ahead.
→ {"text": "我們有一位費勒少校可以……請開始吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. I'm a retired Air Force major with the 5,000 flying hours, and I'm currently the Eastern Regional Director of the Mutual UFO Network, which is studying this phenomenon, and editor of the Filers Files.
→ {"text": "我是退役空軍少校，累積了5,000飛行小時，目前擔任MUFON（UFO互動網絡）東部地區主管，該組織正在研究這個現象，同時也是《Filer's Files》的編輯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. When I was flying for the Air Force 420th Air Refueling Squadron stationed at RAF Sculthorpe in England in January of '62, we were in orbit for refueling fighter aircraft over the North Sea at about 30,000 feet in our KB-50J tanker just after sunset on a clear night.
→ {"text": "1962年1月，當時我隸屬於駐紮在英格蘭RAF Sculthorpe基地的空軍第420空中加油中隊，我們在一個晴朗的夜晚日落後不久，駕駛KB-50J加油機在北海上空約30,000英呎處盤旋，準備為戰鬥機加油。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. London Control excitedly called us and notified us that they had an unidentified object hovering on their radar near Stonehenge.
→ {"text": "倫敦航管中心興奮地聯繫我們，通知他們在雷達上發現巨石陣附近有一個不明物體盤旋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. We were asked if we were willing to intercept the unidentified craft, and our refueling mission had just finished, so we quickly agreed to chase their UFO.
→ {"text": "他們問我們是否願意攔截這架不明飛行器，而我們的加油任務剛剛結束，所以我們很快同意去追逐這個不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. We were given an intercept heading and started to dive toward the UFO.
→ {"text": "我們被給予一個攔截航向，然後開始朝不明飛行物俯衝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. It was really an exciting situation.
→ {"text": "那真的是一個令人興奮的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. We were to go towards Stonehenge, which is over the center of England.
→ {"text": "我們要飛往巨石陣，它位於英格蘭中部。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. London Control was diverting all aircraft out of our way so that we could have a clear path for the intercept.
→ {"text": "倫敦航管中心正在引導所有飛機避開我們的航線，以便我們有一條暢通的攔截路徑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. Then we realized we were above our red line speed on the aircraft and had to pull back on the power, and London Control started giving us distances to the hovering UFO next.
→ {"text": "然後我們意識到飛機已經超過了紅線速度，必須減速，接著倫敦航管中心開始告訴我們與盤旋中不明飛行物的距離。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. It was some 60 miles ahead and then 40 and so on, and as we got closer, we got the radar going on our aircraft and picked up the hovering UFO in the distance, about 30 miles.
→ {"text": "它最初在約60英里前方，然後是40英里，以此類推，隨著我們靠近，我們啟動了飛機上的雷達，在約30英里處捕捉到那個盤旋的不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. It was an exceptionally large radar return.
→ {"text": "那是一個異常巨大的雷達回波。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. Just judging on the size of the radar return, it was about equal to the Brooklyn Bridge or the Firth or Fourth Bridge in Scotland, which is a huge bridge about a mile long.
→ {"text": "僅從雷達回波的大小判斷，它大約相當於布魯克林大橋或蘇格蘭的福斯橋，那是一座約一英里長的巨大橋樑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. It was the biggest radar return that I'd ever seen on the aircraft radar.
→ {"text": "那是我在飛機雷達上看過最大的回波。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. It was sharp and solid as compared to the fuzziness of a rain cloud.
→ {"text": "與雨雲的模糊回波相比，它清晰而堅實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

156. I felt the craft must be made of steel or some kind of strong metal.
→ {"text": "我感覺那架飛行器一定是由鋼鐵或某種堅硬金屬製成的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. We were doing about 425 miles per hour as we approached about 10 miles.
→ {"text": "當我們接近到約10英里時，我們的時速約為425英里。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. This gives you an example of how large a radar return it was.
→ {"text": "這讓你了解那個雷達回波有多大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. It was a dark night, and we could only see a series of dim lights directly ahead.
→ {"text": "那是一個漆黑的夜晚，我們只能看到正前方有一系列昏暗的燈光。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. This is something it ought to look like in the distance.
→ {"text": "遠處看起來應該就是這個樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. Suddenly, the UFO seemed to come alive and the lights brightened immensely, and the UFO accelerated in a launch similar to a space shuttle taking off.
→ {"text": "突然，不明飛行物似乎活了過來，燈光變得極其明亮，不明飛行物以類似太空梭發射的方式加速升空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. It lit up the sky and disappeared, frankly.
→ {"text": "老實說，它照亮了天空然後消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. We saw much brighter lights and a fantastic acceleration.
→ {"text": "我們看到了更明亮的燈光和驚人的加速度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. It seemed to go straight up, just estimating speed like 50,000 miles an hour, 100 times faster than we were moving.
→ {"text": "它似乎筆直向上飛去，估計速度約為每小時50,000英里，比我們的速度快了100倍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. We asked London Control if they had any rocket launches in the area.
→ {"text": "我們詢問倫敦航管中心該區域是否有火箭發射。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. London Control seemed as disappointed as we were, and the controller said, "There are no rocket launches in the area.
→ {"text": "倫敦航管中心似乎和我們一樣失望，管制員說：「該區域沒有火箭發射。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. Thank you for your intercept, you are now cleared to return to your mission."

169. Interestingly, the Air Force did not seem particularly interested.
→ {"text": "有趣的是，空軍似乎並不特別感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. A few weeks later, we were invited to a dining in with Prince Philip as a speaker, and he asked to speak with the air crews that had chased the UFO, so apparently London Control had told him that we had to chase this UFO, and we sat down at the table with him, and he was very friendly, and I essentially told him what I just told you, and he indicated that he regularly interviewed the air crews that were chasing UFOs.
→ {"text": "幾週後，我們受邀參加一場晚宴，菲利普親王是演講嘉賓，他要求與追逐不明飛行物的機組人員談話，顯然倫敦航管中心告訴過他我們追逐不明飛行物的事，我們與他同桌而坐，他非常友善，我基本上告訴了他我剛才告訴各位的內容，他表示他經常訪問追逐不明飛行物的機組人員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. Either he or his aide would interview them.
→ {"text": "他本人或他的助手會訪問他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. I asked why he, Prince Philip, was personally interested in UFOs, and he said that his uncle, the Earl Mountbatten, had seen the UFOs close up in the Navy, and that obviously he believed his uncle.
→ {"text": "我問為什麼菲利普親王本人對不明飛行物感興趣，他說他的叔叔蒙巴頓伯爵在海軍時曾近距離看過不明飛行物，顯然他相信他叔叔的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Earl Mountbatten 為蒙巴頓伯爵"}

173. This gives you some indications of the ships that this one was taking over Japan, and if you notice, there's a large cylinder, but outside the cylinder, there's 12 disc craft, and this is typically what they do.
→ {"text": "這讓你了解在日本上空出現的飛船的一些特徵，如果你注意看，有一個巨大的圓柱體，但在圓柱體外面，有12個碟形飛行器，這是它們典型的運作方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. They're often called mother ships because they launch the smaller disc-shaped craft from them.
→ {"text": "它們通常被稱為母艦，因為它們會從上面發射較小的碟形飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. This picture was taken by NASA over the Atlantic Ocean near Iceland.
→ {"text": "這張照片是NASA在冰島附近的大西洋上空拍攝的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. This one was actually a video, this is one shot from the video taken over England on Burnham on the Sea on February 11, 2009.
→ {"text": "這實際上是一段影片，這是2009年2月11日在英格蘭濱海伯納姆上空拍攝的影片中的一個畫面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. This is something interesting that I feel or have the theory that the ancient British actually copied the UFOs.
→ {"text": "這有一個有趣的觀點，我認為或我有個理論是古英國人實際上模仿了不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

178. The archeological structures are carved in the ground in England.
→ {"text": "這些考古遺跡是刻畫在英格蘭的地面上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. There's dozens of them, and these structures are over a mile long.
→ {"text": "有數十個這樣的結構，而且這些結構超過一英里長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. This is how they're made, these ditches are carved out, and if you think about the type of energy that it takes to make what amounts to a two mile around section of these ditches, the British archeologists call them cursus because they remind them of kind of a racetrack, but I suggest that they, in fact, show that the craft had been there in ancient times.
→ {"text": "它們是這樣建造的，這些溝渠被挖掘出來，如果你想想需要什麼樣的能量才能挖掘出約兩英里長的溝渠區域，英國考古學家稱它們為cursus，因為它們讓人想起賽跑道，但我認為它們實際上顯示了這些飛行器在古代就曾出現在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "cursus 為考古學術語，指巨石陣附近的平行溝渠遺跡"}

181. There's another picture of one, the Stonehenge curses, and as you see outlined on the ground.
→ {"text": "還有另一張照片，是巨石陣的cursus，正如你在地面上看到的輪廓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文curses應為cursus之轉錄錯誤"}

182. This is right in the Stonehenge area.
→ {"text": "這就在巨石陣區域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. This is one of the typical disc-shaped craft, and they built these huge hills in England.
→ {"text": "這是典型的碟形飛行器之一，而且他們在英格蘭建造了這些巨大的土丘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. The question is why were they built?
→ {"text": "問題是為什麼要建造它們？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. It happens that the disc-shaped aircraft seem to be able to power up by the energy inside the hills and the electrical energy coming down.
→ {"text": "巧合的是，碟形飛行器似乎能夠從土丘內部的能量以及從天而降的電能中獲取動力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. Next.
→ {"text": "下一張。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. We feel that it's something like the cargo coat in World War II.
→ {"text": "我們認為這類似於二戰時期的貨物崇拜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "cargo coat應為cargo cult（貨物崇拜）之轉錄錯誤"}

188. The natives in the South Pacific made shapes of aircraft on the ground and that the British in the ancient times may have done the same thing.
→ {"text": "南太平洋的島民在地面上製作飛機的形狀，而古代英國人可能也做了同樣的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. Next.
→ {"text": "下一張。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. This is one of the better craft pictures taken in Cumberland, Rhode Island on July 3rd, 1967, and this was colorized, and the windows put in next.
→ {"text": "這是1967年7月3日在羅德島坎伯蘭拍攝的較好的飛行器照片之一，這張經過彩色處理，並加上了窗戶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. One Navy chief petty officer, flight engineer with 10,000 hours, had also seen a UFO, and he said that cigar-shaped craft was twice the size of two aircraft carriers.
→ {"text": "一位累積了10,000飛行小時的海軍士官長、飛航工程師也看到了不明飛行物，他說那個雪茄形飛行器有兩艘航空母艦那麼大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. And the object moved east at about 100 knots and was a huge aircraft.
→ {"text": "而且該物體以約100節的速度向東移動，是一架巨大的飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. A similar one was seen by two pilots on two different airlines over the English Channel on April 23rd, 2007.
→ {"text": "2007年4月23日，兩位來自不同航空公司的飛行員在英吉利海峽上空看到了類似的飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. Next.
→ {"text": "下一張。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. Captain Ray Bauer in his Aurigny aircraft and a Blue Islands pilot had seen these UFOs and reported them.
→ {"text": "Aurigny航空的雷·鮑爾機長和一位Blue Islands的飛行員看到了這些不明飛行物並報告了此事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. Any case, these spacecraft occasionally roam our skies.
→ {"text": "無論如何，這些太空船偶爾會在我們的天空中遊蕩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. They're seen by many people, by many pilots and air crews, and I think they've been here for thousands of years, and our祖先 made structures on the ground to remind us that they had actually been here.
→ {"text": "它們被許多人、許多飛行員和機組人員看到，我認為它們已經在這裡數千年了，我們的祖先在地面上建造了這些結構來提醒我們它們確實曾經來過這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. I've been interested in UFOs ever since, and I'd like to dedicate this talk to my two daughters that recently passed away.
→ {"text": "從那時起我就對不明飛行物產生了興趣，我想把這次演講獻給我最近在不久前過世的兩個女兒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
