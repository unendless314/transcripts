262. Now, if we could hear from Lieutenant Colonel Richard French.
→ {"text": "現在，讓我們聽聽理查德·弗倫奇中校的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. I am Lieutenant Colonel Richard French.
→ {"text": "我是理查德·弗倫奇中校。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. I was a fighter pilot in both Korea and Vietnam.
→ {"text": "我曾在韓國和越南擔任戰鬥機飛行員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. During a number of my flights, a number of flights of mine, I have a little trouble reading this because it's been freehand written, and I'm having a little trouble picking it up, witnesses to the sightings of a number of UFOs.
→ {"text": "在我多次飛行任務中，我親眼目擊了多次不明飛行物。我閱讀這份手稿有點困難，因為這是手寫的，我有些地方看不太清楚。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文語序較為口語化且有些混亂，已調整為通順的中文表達"}

266. I'm going to go to the first one that stands out most in my mind.
→ {"text": "我要先說說最讓我印象深刻的一次經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. I was at Spandau in Germany when I received a telephone call from the OSI district commander telling me to go investigate a reported UFO in the water in Newfoundland.
→ {"text": "當時我在德國施潘道，接到 OSI（空軍特別調查辦公室）地區指揮官的電話，要我去調查紐芬蘭一起報告稱在水中的不明飛行物事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. Approximately four hours later, I arrived to find a large crowd on the wharf, and there were divers in the water.
→ {"text": "大約四小時後，我到達現場，發現碼頭上擠滿了人群，還有潛水員在水中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. The water was very clear.
→ {"text": "海水非常清澈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. You could see down as much as 200 feet in it.
→ {"text": "可以看到水下約200英尺深的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. What I saw down there were two UFOs parked side by side, but I couldn't see anyone around either one of them.
→ {"text": "我在水下看到的是兩艘不明飛行物並排停放，但周圍看不到任何人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. Then a little later, someone moved to one of the UFO occupants, and I guess go ahead and call them what they are, the alien.
→ {"text": "過了一會兒，有人移動到其中一艘不明飛行物旁，我想就直接稱呼他們的真實身分吧，那是外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. Moved over to the side and came into my line of sight.
→ {"text": "他移動到側面，進入了我的視線範圍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. Very soon after that, he came out of the water going approximately 100 miles an hour.
→ {"text": "很快之後，他以大約每小時100英里的速度衝出水面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. As soon as he broke the surface of the water, he increased his speed to approximately 2,500 miles an hour and quickly went out of sight.
→ {"text": "他一衝出水面，就將速度提升到每小時約2，500英里，迅速消失在我的視線中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. He was gone for about 15 or 20 minutes.
→ {"text": "他離開了大約15到20分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. He came right back, right, went and slowed down very much, went in the water again at about 100 miles an hour, went on down to ... He and the other one, you could see them working on the UFOs.
→ {"text": "他回來了，大幅減速，以每小時約100英里的速度再次潛入水中，繼續下潛……他和另一個外星人，你可以看到他們正在修理那些不明飛行物。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文有口語化的停頓和重複，已調整為流暢的中文"}

278. After about approximately 2 hours of apparently performing maintenance on the UFOs, the two of them took off together again, left the water at about 100 miles an hour, immediately accelerated to well over 2,500 miles an hour, went virtually straight up and disappeared.
→ {"text": "在進行了大約兩小時的維修工作後，兩艘飛行物一起再次起飛，以每小時約100英里的速度離開水面，隨即加速到超過每小時2，500英里，幾乎垂直上升後消失。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. The speeds that I reported this, I arrived at the figures simply by triangulation and in that I can take things that were at a known distance and then calculate based on where they were and how long it took them to get to another place is what I use as a standard for estimating their speed.
→ {"text": "我所報告的速度數據，是透過三角測量法得出的。我會以已知距離的物體為參照，根據它們的位置和移動到另一地點所需的時間來計算，這就是我估算速度的標準方法。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文為口語化的技術說明，已調整為較正式的表達"}

280. In another instance, I was on my way to Libya.
→ {"text": "另一次，我當時正前往利比亞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. Again, I was out over the water just about three miles offshore of the northern extreme of the Mediterranean Sea.
→ {"text": "同樣地，我正在地中海北端約三英里外的海面上空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. I looked up to my left and five miles away I saw a lighted UFO.
→ {"text": "我抬頭向左看，在五英里外看到一艘發光的不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. I went down into the ... It went down into the center of Mount Blanc.
→ {"text": "它飛進了……它飛進了法國白朗峰的中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. If you know where Mount Blanc is in France, anyway, it went down into the center of Mount Blanc.
→ {"text": "如果你知道法國白朗峰在哪裡，總之，它飛進了白朗峰的中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. It was down there for approximately 15 minutes and turned around and came right back out.
→ {"text": "它在那裡停留了大約15分鐘，然後掉頭飛了出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. Since then, I have noticed that there's something about the inside of volcanoes that seems to attract them and in discussing that with other people, we reached this conclusion that whether it's right or wrong, this is the closest we can get to a logical reason for why they do that.
→ {"text": "從那時起，我注意到火山內部似乎有某種東西在吸引它們。在與其他人討論後，我們得出這個結論：無論對錯，這是我們能想到最合理的解釋。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文較長且結構複雜，已調整為通順的中文"}

287. They may very well be and have been for some time actually defending the earth because what other purpose would they have for it?
→ {"text": "他們很可能已經在一段時間內實際上在保護地球，因為除此之外還有什麼目的呢？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

288. We have no way of knowing whether they are doing something constructive because I'm certain that they wouldn't risk their equipment and lives and like that if they didn't have a useful purpose for it.
→ {"text": "我們無法確知他們是否在做某種建設性的事情，但我確信，如果沒有實際的用途，他們不會冒著設備和生命的危險這樣做。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

289. I just mentioned in others, I saw the same thing in Hawaii and again, the live volcano at Kīlauea, which I'm sure you're familiar with, but anyway, it went down inside of that.
→ {"text": "我剛才提到其他例子，我在夏威夷也看到了同樣的情況，在夏威夷基拉韋厄活火山，我相信你們都知道這座火山，總之，它也飛進了火山內部。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. I saw them again when I was down in Sicily and they went down inside of the volcano that's, you know, the famous one that has, when it erupted, it lay waste to about a hundred square miles of land.
→ {"text": "我在西西里島時再次看到它們，它們飛進了那座火山內部，你知道的，就是那座著名的火山，它爆發時摧毀了約一百平方英里的土地。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. In all cases, the UFOs, they've all been the same shape.
→ {"text": "在所有這些案例中，那些不明飛行物的形狀都相同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. They've all been the cigar shape type and in all cases where I was able to see the aliens, they were what we call grays, you've probably heard them mentioned by other people that are reporting in this same convention.
→ {"text": "都是雪茄形的，而且在所有我能看到外星人的情況下，他們就是我們所說的灰人，你們可能已經從本次聽證會其他報告者那裡聽說過他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. The last that I personally witnessed happened right in Sedona where I lived quite recently and what happened, I used to go out in the early evening, I'd go out on my back patio and you know, look at the stars and the scenery in Sedona is spectacular as you may know if you've been there.
→ {"text": "我個人目擊的最後一次事件就發生在我最近居住的塞多納。事情是這樣的，我過去常在傍晚時分到後院露臺看星星，如果你去過塞多納，就知道那裡的景色非常壯觀。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

294. But anyway, I saw this one go by but when it went by, I didn't think it was a UFO.
→ {"text": "總之，我看到這個東西飛過，但當時我並不認為它是不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. The thing I thought was that it was simply a meteorite but you know, I watched it and it went from north to south and disappeared and I thought, "Well, that's a meteorite."
→ {"text": "我以為那不過是一顆隕石，但你知道，我觀察著它從北向南飛去並消失，我心想：「嗯，那是顆隕石。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. And I believed that until the thing turned 180 degrees and flew back.
→ {"text": "我一直這樣認為，直到那東西轉了180度又飛了回來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. Well, that immediately convinced me that that was something that meteorites don't normally do and that concludes my speech, gentlemen.
→ {"text": "這立即讓我確信，這絕不是隕石會做的事。各位先生，我的證詞到此結束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. Mr. Steve Allen, would you proceed?
→ {"text": "史蒂夫·艾倫先生，請開始您的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
