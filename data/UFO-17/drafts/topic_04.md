## Speaker Group 1

262. Now, if we could hear from Lieutenant Colonel Richard French.

263. I am Lieutenant Colonel Richard French.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. I was a fighter pilot in both Korea and Vietnam.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. During a number of my flights, a number of flights of mine, I have a little trouble reading this because it's been freehand written, and I'm having a little trouble picking it up, witnesses to the sightings of a number of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. I'm going to go to the first one that stands out most in my mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. I was at Spandau in Germany when I received a telephone call from the OSI district commander telling me to go investigate a reported UFO in the water in Newfoundland.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. Approximately four hours later, I arrived to find a large crowd on the wharf, and there were divers in the water.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. The water was very clear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. You could see down as much as 200 feet in it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. What I saw down there were two UFOs parked side by side, but I couldn't see anyone around either one of them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. Then a little later, someone moved to one of the UFO occupants, and I guess go ahead and call them what they are, the alien.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. Moved over to the side and came into my line of sight.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. Very soon after that, he came out of the water going approximately 100 miles an hour.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. As soon as he broke the surface of the water, he increased his speed to approximately 2,500 miles an hour and quickly went out of sight.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. He was gone for about 15 or 20 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. He came right back, right, went and slowed down very much, went in the water again at about 100 miles an hour, went on down to ... He and the other one, you could see them working on the UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. After about approximately 2 hours of apparently performing maintenance on the UFOs, the two of them took off together again, left the water at about 100 miles an hour, immediately accelerated to well over 2,500 miles an hour, went virtually straight up and disappeared.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. The speeds that I reported this, I arrived at the figures simply by triangulation and in that I can take things that were at a known distance and then calculate based on where they were and how long it took them to get to another place is what I use as a standard for estimating their speed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. In another instance, I was on my way to Libya.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. Again, I was out over the water just about three miles offshore of the northern extreme of the Mediterranean Sea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. I looked up to my left and five miles away I saw a lighted UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. I went down into the ... It went down into the center of Mount Blanc.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. If you know where Mount Blanc is in France, anyway, it went down into the center of Mount Blanc.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. It was down there for approximately 15 minutes and turned around and came right back out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. Since then, I have noticed that there's something about the inside of volcanoes that seems to attract them and in discussing that with other people, we reached this conclusion that whether it's right or wrong, this is the closest we can get to a logical reason for why they do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. They may very well be and have been for some time actually defending the earth because what other purpose would they have for it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. We have no way of knowing whether they are doing something constructive because I'm certain that they wouldn't risk their equipment and lives and like that if they didn't have a useful purpose for it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. I just mentioned in others, I saw the same thing in Hawaii and again, the live volcano at Kīlauea, which I'm sure you're familiar with, but anyway, it went down inside of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. I saw them again when I was down in Sicily and they went down inside of the volcano that's, you know, the famous one that has, when it erupted, it lay waste to about a hundred square miles of land.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. In all cases, the UFOs, they've all been the same shape.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. They've all been the cigar shape type and in all cases where I was able to see the aliens, they were what we call grays, you've probably heard them mentioned by other people that are reporting in this same convention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. The last that I personally witnessed happened right in Sedona where I lived quite recently and what happened, I used to go out in the early evening, I'd go out on my back patio and you know, look at the stars and the scenery in Sedona is spectacular as you may know if you've been there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. But anyway, I saw this one go by but when it went by, I didn't think it was a UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. The thing I thought was that it was simply a meteorite but you know, I watched it and it went from north to south and disappeared and I thought, "Well, that's a meteorite."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. And I believed that until the thing turned 180 degrees and flew back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. Well, that immediately convinced me that that was something that meteorites don't normally do and that concludes my speech, gentlemen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. Mr. Steve Allen, would you proceed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
