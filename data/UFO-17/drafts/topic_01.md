4. I'm delighted that this first panel includes people that have been in airplanes as pilots, flying those.
→ {"text": "我很高興這第一組證人包括了曾經擔任飛行員、實際駕駛飛機的人士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

5. They've also been involved as controllers and I understand FAA administration is represented here as someone from that.
→ {"text": "他們也曾擔任航空管制員，而且我了解現場也有來自FAA（聯邦航空總署）的代表。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. I'd also like to just acknowledge a gentleman on this panel that's flown more combat missions for the United States Air Force than any other person in the history of the United States and his record is double the man that's in second place and that's Lieutenant Colonel Richard French.
→ {"text": "我也想特別提及這組證人中的一位男士，他為美國空軍執行的戰鬥任務次數比美國歷史上任何人都多，他的紀錄是第二名的兩倍，這位就是理查德·弗倫奇中校。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. So you've been sworn in, we'll start with a testimony of John Callahan, if I could just quickly ask Mr. Bookman time limits that have been determined for this panel?
→ {"text": "既然各位已經宣誓，我們將從約翰·卡拉漢的證詞開始。在此我想先請問布克曼先生，這組證人的時間限制是如何規定的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. Ten minutes for opening statements and then we'll divide the remaining time among them.
→ {"text": "開場陳述有十分鐘，之後我們會將剩餘時間分配給各位證人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. How much time for questions?
→ {"text": "質詢時間有多少？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. Depends on if they keep to their ten minutes.
→ {"text": "這取決於他們是否遵守十分鐘的限制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. Well hey, I've got the gavel, I'll keep to it.
→ {"text": "嘿，我手上有議事槌，我會遵守時間的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. Then it will be roughly a ten minute Q&A session for each member of Congress.
→ {"text": "那麼每位國會議員大約會有十分鐘的質詢時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. Then they're definitely going to keep to it.
→ {"text": "那他們肯定會遵守時間的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. John Callahan, if you could begin.
→ {"text": "約翰·卡拉漢，請開始吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. I don't know what I can do in ten minutes but I'll do the best I can.
→ {"text": "我不知道十分鐘能說多少，但我會盡力而為。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. Apparently you guys already have a copy of what I'm going to say.
→ {"text": "顯然諸位已經有一份我要說的內容的副本了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. I'll just hit the highlights.
→ {"text": "我就挑重點說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. I was the Division Chief of the Accidents Evaluations and Investigation Division of the FAA in Washington D.C. from 1981 to 1988.
→ {"text": "我於1981年至1988年擔任FAA（聯邦航空總署）華盛頓特區事故評估與調查部的主管。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. I was the first man selected for that position and we created that position.
→ {"text": "我是第一位被選上這個職位的人，而且這個職位是我們當時新設立的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. It came about after the air traffic control strike.
→ {"text": "這個職位是在航空管制員罷工事件之後設立的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. FAA had no quality control in the system until the strike and then I was selected for that position and it turned out to be a division with five branches.
→ {"text": "FAA在罷工之前系統內沒有品質管控機制，後來我被選上擔任這個職位，結果這成了一個有五個分支部門的單位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. During this time I was involved in the investigation of an extraordinary event and was asked not to talk about it.
→ {"text": "在這段期間，我參與調查了一起非凡的事件，並被要求不得對外談論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. That's retiring.
→ {"text": "那是過去的事了。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語境指現在已經退休，可以說了"}

25. I decided that the public had a right for this information and that they could handle it.
→ {"text": "我決定公眾有權知道這些資訊，而且他們能夠承受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. Nothing's happened to me as a result of discussing this out in public.
→ {"text": "公開談論這件事並沒有對我造成任何影響。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. In early January of 1987 I received a call from the air traffic control facility out in Alaska.
→ {"text": "1987年1月初，我接到來自阿拉斯加航空管制中心的電話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. It was the region and they wanted to know what to tell the media.
→ {"text": "那是該地區的單位，他們想知道該怎麼回應媒體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. Initially the office was full of media, they had them in the hall and every time they went out to do anything the media was sticking the microphone under their face and they wanted to know what to tell them.
→ {"text": "一開始辦公室裡擠滿了媒體，走廊上也有，每次他們出去做什麼事，媒體就把麥克風塞到他們面前，他們想知道該如何回應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. So I said, "Tell them about what?"
→ {"text": "所以我說：「要跟他們說什麼事？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. He said, "About the UFO," and the next one was, "What UFO?"
→ {"text": "他說：「關於不明飛行物的事。」我接著問：「什麼不明飛行物？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. We had established a procedure that if anything newsworthy happened in the FAA, we and our division would know right away so we could defend the United States government.
→ {"text": "我們有一套既定程序，如果FAA發生任何有新聞價值的事件，我們部門應該會立刻知道，以便我們能為美國政府辯護。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. Anyway I said, "What UFO?"
→ {"text": "總之我說：「什麼不明飛行物？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. He said, "A couple of weeks ago," is what he told me, it was really a couple of months ago, they had a UFO chase at 747 across the Alaskan skies for some 31 minutes.
→ {"text": "他說：「大約幾週前。」但他告訴我的其實是幾個月前，有一架747客機在阿拉斯加上空被不明飛行物追逐了約31分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. But like who believes in UFOs?
→ {"text": "但誰會相信不明飛行物呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. Somehow the media heard that this was going on and now they're out there in the halls and he didn't know what to do.
→ {"text": "不知怎麼的，媒體聽說了這件事，現在都擠在走廊上，他不知道該怎麼辦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. They couldn't do their job and he was kind of panicking.
→ {"text": "他們無法正常工作，他有點慌了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. So I gave him our official answer, "Tell them it's under investigation."
→ {"text": "於是我給了他我們的官方答案：「告訴他們正在調查中。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. And once you tell them that they kind of drift away and they're all gone.
→ {"text": "一旦這樣告訴他們，他們就會逐漸散去，最後全部離開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. Then I said, "I want you to pack up all that data we have, all the computer data."
→ {"text": "然後我說：「我要你們打包所有我們擁有的資料，所有電腦數據。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. And in those days when we talk about computer data and disk, we're talking about those disks that were like a 78 record player and it looked like a Pi case that they have in the delis.
→ {"text": "在那個年代，當我們說到電腦數據和磁碟時，我們指的是那些像78轉唱片的磁碟，看起來就像熟食店裡的派盒那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. There'd be 10 or 12 of these things inside.
→ {"text": "裡面會有10到12個這樣的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. That was the disk that we're talking about, not these little things you carry around with you today.
→ {"text": "那才是我們當時說的磁碟，不是你們現在隨身攜帶的這種小東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. So I said, "I want all that stuff.
→ {"text": "所以我說：「我要所有那些資料。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. I want the voice tapes.
→ {"text": "我要語音錄音帶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. I want everything sent to the FAA tech center by tomorrow morning.
→ {"text": "我要所有東西在明天早上之前送到FAA技術中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. You put them on the red eye flight and we're going to go down to the tech center and look at what you have."
→ {"text": "你們把它們放上夜間航班，我們會去技術中心看看你們有什麼。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. And the tech center is where they create the software programs for the FAA, 548 facilities there were at the time.
→ {"text": "技術中心是他們為FAA開發軟體程式的地方，當時有548個設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. I used to run that automation department, had 176 people working for me.
→ {"text": "我以前管理那個自動化部門，有176個人為我工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. They also had a program called Playback or they had another name too, I forget it right now.
→ {"text": "他們還有一個叫做Playback的程式，或者還有另一個名字，我現在忘了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. Anyway, you could go into the facility at the tech center and you could walk into one of the control rooms and you could say, "I want this position to be set up exactly like the position in Alaska.
→ {"text": "總之，你可以走進技術中心的設施，進入其中一間管制室，然後說：「我要把這個位置設定得跟阿拉斯加那個位置完全一樣。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. I want to stand over here and look at the radar and see what the controller's seeing.
→ {"text": "我要站在這裡看著雷達，看看管制員看到了什麼。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. I want the voice tapes to come out of the speaker above and I want them synchronized with what we're looking at.
→ {"text": "我要語音錄音帶從上面的喇叭播放出來，而且我要它們與我們看到的畫面同步。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. So when the man says he's over Alaska, I want the radar to say he's over Alaska.
→ {"text": "這樣當那個人說他在阿拉斯加上空時，我要雷達也顯示他在阿拉斯加上空。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. And I want to see what was going on.
→ {"text": "我要看到底發生了什麼事。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. I want to hear what was going on."
→ {"text": "我要聽聽到底發生了什麼事。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. So they played it for me and toward the end, while we're looking at it, they would shut the program off.
→ {"text": "所以他們播放給我看，但到了快結束的時候，當我們在看著時，他們會把程式關掉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. So I said, "I want you to play it again, but don't shut the program off until I tell you to shut it off."
→ {"text": "所以我說：「我要你們再播放一次，但在我叫你們關掉之前不要關掉程式。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

59. And I had bought a camera with me, what do they call these cameras here, ones that play these things here.
→ {"text": "我還帶了一台攝影機，這裡叫這種攝影機什麼來著，就是那種可以播放這些東西的機器。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語意略顯模糊，但應指攝影機"}

60. Anyway, I took a video of it the second time they played it and it was the first time I really used the camera and it was a little shaky if you ever get to look at it, but it shows you everything that was on the screen.
→ {"text": "總之，第二次播放時我錄了影，那是我第一次真正使用那台攝影機，如果你們有機會看的話會發現畫面有點晃動，但它記錄了螢幕上的一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. And as they're playing the second one, they shut it off again toward the end.
→ {"text": "當他們播放第二遍時，又在快結束的時候關掉了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. And I finally said, "There must be something wrong with our communications because I didn't come from the South."
→ {"text": "我最後說：「我們的溝通一定有問題，因為我不是從南方來的。」", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語意指他們應該聽從他的指示，暗示他是從北方/上級來的"}

63. I said, "I want you to leave it on until I say shut it off."
→ {"text": "我說：「我要你們繼續播放，直到我叫你們關掉為止。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. And they were a little hesitant.
→ {"text": "他們有點猶豫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. They didn't want to do that.
→ {"text": "他們不想這麼做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. And I finally told the engineer there, I said, "You either do it, I tell you, or tomorrow you're going to have to find another job."
→ {"text": "我最後告訴那裡的工程師：「你要麼照我說的做，要麼明天就得另找工作。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. So they let it play.
→ {"text": "所以他們讓它繼續播放。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. Well, toward the end, the controllers had taken a United and they asked them if they could delay his arrival时间 and have him check this 747 that was coming southbound.
→ {"text": "嗯，到了快結束的時候，管制員聯繫了一架聯合航空的飛機，問他們是否可以延遲抵達時間，並讓他查看這架正在向南飛行的747客機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. So they vectored him over to the 747, he's about 2,000 feet beneath him.
→ {"text": "所以他們引導他飛向那架747，他在747下方約2,000英呎處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

70. And the United says, "It's a beautiful airplane, the moon behind him, it looks good."
→ {"text": "然後聯合航空的飛行員說：「那是一架漂亮的飛機，月亮在它後面，看起來很棒。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. He says, "It's so clear up here, you can see it the next Tuesday."
→ {"text": "他說：「這裡的天氣太晴朗了，你下個星期二都還能看見它。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": "誇張說法，形容視野極佳"}

72. And then he passed by.
→ {"text": "然後他就飛過去了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. Well, after he passed by, that target that had been chasing the 747 turned around and started following the United as he went down into Alaska.
→ {"text": "嗯，在他飛過去之後，那個一直在追逐747的目標轉身開始跟隨那架聯合航空的飛機，一直跟到阿拉斯加。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. Now, when the Japanese pilot first come on the frequency, for you guys that are familiar with radar or how the military or the controllers work, when he first come on the frequency for the controller, the first words out of his mouth was, "Do you have traffic for me?"
→ {"text": "現在，當那位日本飛行員第一次使用這個頻道時，對於熟悉雷達或軍方或管制員作業方式的各位來說，當他第一次使用管制頻道時，他開口說的第一句話是：「你們有我的周邊交通嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. And when a controller hears these words, it means doom because right away he forgot something.
→ {"text": "當管制員聽到這句話時，這意味著大事不妙，因為這表示他漏掉了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. He's got somebody else up there that shouldn't and why would a pilot ask if we had traffic?
→ {"text": "空中有個不應該存在的東西，而且為什麼飛行員會問我們有沒有周邊交通？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. And he looked at a scope and he says, "Negative, there's no traffic in your area."
→ {"text": "他看了雷達螢幕說：「沒有，你的區域沒有任何周邊交通。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. And the Japanese pilot says, "Oh yeah, there's traffic out here and it's at 12 o'clock and about eight miles."
→ {"text": "然後日本飛行員說：「哦，有的，這裡有周邊交通，在12點鐘方向，大約8英里處。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. He's telling him.
→ {"text": "他在告訴管制員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. Well, and the next thing the controller says is, "Can you tell me what type is?
→ {"text": "嗯，然後管制員接著說：「你能告訴我那是什麼類型的飛機嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. Can you make out the type of aircraft, any markings on the plane that we can find out who it is?"
→ {"text": "你能辨認出飛機的類型嗎？飛機上有沒有任何標記可以讓我們查出是誰的？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. He's thinking it's a military aircraft.
→ {"text": "他以為那是軍用飛機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. And the Japanese pilot says, "There's no markings.
→ {"text": "然後日本飛行員說：「沒有任何標記。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. It's as big as four aircraft carriers.
→ {"text": "它跟四艘航空母艦一樣大。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. It has yellow and white lights around the center and it's big."
→ {"text": "它中間有黃色和白色的燈光，而且很大。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. And he was a little bit worried.
→ {"text": "他有點擔心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. Well, this machine followed him down for 31 minutes halfway through his flight.
→ {"text": "嗯，這個飛行器在航程中途跟隨了他31分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. He makes a 360 degree turn.
→ {"text": "他做了一個360度轉彎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. Now, when I say he makes it, he doesn't do anything unless the FAA says you can do this.
→ {"text": "我說他做這個動作，意思是除非FAA說可以這麼做，否則他不會擅自行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. So they told him if you want to deviate, you want to change your altitude, let us know.
→ {"text": "所以他們告訴他，如果你想偏離航線，想改變高度，請告訴我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. When he changed his altitude a couple of times, he makes a 360 and this UFO stayed with him all the way, scared the pants off him.
→ {"text": "當他改變了幾次高度後，他做了一個360度轉彎，這個不明飛行物全程跟著他，把他嚇壞了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. I don't know how much more time I got.
→ {"text": "我不知道我還有多少時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. Anyway, when I got done- You've got about a minute and a half to two minutes.
→ {"text": "總之，當我說完時——你還有一分半到兩分鐘的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. So I shoot back to the FAA center and the administrator at the time was Admiral Engen.
→ {"text": "所以我趕回FAA中心，當時的局長是恩根上將。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. I don't know if you guys knew Admiral Ingen.
→ {"text": "我不知道各位是否認識恩根上將。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文Admiral Ingen為Admiral Engen之轉錄錯誤"}

97. I got there about quarter to five because I wanted to go home with my wife and he heard I was in the building so he calls me up and he says, "Give me a five minute briefing on what you've seen."
→ {"text": "我大約在差五分五點時到達，因為我想和太太一起回家，他聽說我在大樓裡，所以打電話給我，說：「給我五分鐘簡報，說說你看到了什麼。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. So I gave him what I'm telling you guys here and he wanted to know if that video I took would play on his TV and I said, "I guess so.
→ {"text": "所以我把我現在告訴各位的內容告訴他，他想知道我錄的影帶能不能在他的電視上播放，我說：「我想可以吧。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. The book says it can."
→ {"text": "說明書上說可以。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. So I plugged it in there and after a few minutes of watching the video, he calls his aide over and he says, "Go tell Kennedy I'm going to be a few minutes late."
→ {"text": "所以我把它插在那裡，看了幾分鐘影帶後，他叫助手過來說：「去告訴甘迺迪，我會晚幾分鐘到。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. So he's watching it a little bit more and then he finally calls the aide over and says, "Go cancel the rest of my appointments tonight.

104. So when he got all done, he says, "Don't talk to anybody.

105. I'll get back with you and I'll tell you what to do.

110. I don't know anything about UFOs."

111. He says, "Well, the one that happened over Alaska," I said, "You probably want to talk to the Admiral.
→ {"text": 「他說：「嗯，就是發生在阿拉斯加上空的那個。」我說：「你可能想跟局長談談。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

112. I don't know what you're talking about."

117. He says, "Your task is to hand this stuff off to them.

118. When they leave here, they have to take this with them because the FAA does not control UFOs."

119. Now, I showed him all this stuff.

120. When they got all- They had about 45 seconds.
→ {"text": 「當他們全部——他們大約還有45秒。」", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語句不完整，應指時間限制"}

121. Okay.
→ {"text": 「好的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. Well done, one of the scientists come out and said they had three or four questions they wanted to know the speed of the antenna, the frequency of the antenna, the logarithm for the height-finding equipment, and the people I brought with me just happened to be experts, and they answered all the questions.
→ {"text": 「做得好，其中一位科學家出來說他們有三、四個問題，他們想知道天線的速度、天線的頻率、測高設備的對數，而我帶來的人正好是專家，他們回答了所有問題。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. When they get done, the CIA guy standing next to me says to the people, "This event," pointing to the big screen they have in the room, "This event never happened.
