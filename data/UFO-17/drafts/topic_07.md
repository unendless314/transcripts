## Speaker Group 1

484. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

485. Mr. Kallen, the event that you describe is exactly the kind of thing that I think is most creditable.
→ {"text": "卡拉漢先生，您所描述的事件正是我認為最可信的那種情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Mr. Kallen 應為 Mr. Callahan 之誤，指 John Callahan"}

486. Let me understand, how many different people saw this?
→ {"text": "讓我了解一下，有多少人看到了這個？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

487. Saw the radar return?
→ {"text": "看到了雷達回波？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

488. Well, are there not people that saw the craft and people that saw the radar returns both?
→ {"text": "那麼，不是有人看到了飛行器，也有人同時看到了雷達回波嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. No, the only ones that saw the craft was the Japanese pilot and the other two with them.
→ {"text": "不，只有那位日本機長和另外兩名機組人員看到了飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

490. Okay, so there were three people that saw the craft, all right, and how many people saw the radar?
→ {"text": "好的，所以有三個人看到了飛行器，那麼有多少人看到了雷達？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

491. I don't know, 20, 30.
→ {"text": "我不知道，20、30個吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

492. Twenty-three people?
→ {"text": "23個人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

493. These are the kinds of things that are just very difficult to explain away, where you have eyewitnesses and a radar track, and a real radar track, but apparently some of these things don't leave a radar track.
→ {"text": "這正是那種很難敷衍帶過的情況，你既有目擊證人又有雷達追蹤，而且是真實的雷達追蹤，但顯然有些東西不會留下雷達訊號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

494. The other day we had testimony from a pilot in South America that they can absorb bullets.
→ {"text": "前幾天我們有一位南美洲飛行員的證詞，說這些東西能夠吸收子彈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

495. Something that can absorb bullets can absorb radar, I would think.
→ {"text": "能夠吸收子彈的東西，我想也能夠吸收雷達波。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

496. Well, the radar picks up all the traffic, but most people don't understand how the system works and that's what blows their mind.
→ {"text": "嗯，雷達會捕捉到所有空中交通，但大多數人不了解系統如何運作，這正是讓他們困惑的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

497. If you're an air traffic controller and you're working your sector in front of you, you've got 500 miles that you're taking care of, the antenna's going by every nine or 10 seconds and it picks up a primary target, which is the size of a pencil eraser, and it puts it on your scope right here.
→ {"text": "如果你是航空管制員，負責你面前的管制區域，你要管理500英里的空域，天線每9到10秒掃描一次，當它捕捉到一個主要目標，只有橡皮擦那麼大，就會顯示在你的螢幕上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

498. You could be working traffic going this way.
→ {"text": "你可能正在指揮往這個方向飛行的航班。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

499. When that target shows up, we don't know who it is, and you're going to look at that and say, "Well, if he gets close to this guy, I'll do something intelligent."
→ {"text": "當那個目標出現時，我們不知道它是誰，你會看著它說：「嗯，如果它靠近這架飛機，我會採取一些明智的行動。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

500. Ten seconds later, that target is over here someplace, nowhere near your traffic, so your mind says it must have been an 18 wheeler, it could be somebody low, I don't know what it was.
→ {"text": "10秒後，那個目標已經到了別的地方，完全不在你的航班附近，所以你的直覺會說那一定是輛18輪大卡車，可能是飛得很低的什麼東西，我不知道那是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

501. The radar always picks up everything flying, but they go so fast that you don't recognize them.
→ {"text": "雷達總是能捕捉到所有飛行物，但它們飛得太快了，你根本認不出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

502. Today, to fly in the FAA system, if you're flying below 10,000, you have to stay at 250 knots.
→ {"text": "現在，要在 FAA 系統中飛行，如果你在10,000英尺以下，必須保持250節以下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

503. If you're flying above 10,000 or above 18,000, you have to have a working transponder on your aircraft.
→ {"text": "如果你在10,000或18,000英尺以上飛行，你的飛機必須配備正常運作的航空應答機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

504. That sends out a signal to the radar that says, "This is me," and it shows a different target on the screen.
→ {"text": "它會向雷達發送訊號說「這是我」，然後螢幕上會顯示不同的目標標示。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

505. That's what we see when our people are flying.
→ {"text": "這就是我們的飛行員飛行時看到的樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

506. The UFOs don't have transponders, and they don't care about our rules and regulations, they come and go.
→ {"text": "不明飛行物沒有航空應答機，它們也不在乎我們的規則和法規，來去自如。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

507. I don't know how you're going to solve that problem.
→ {"text": "我不知道你們要怎麼解決這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

508. Are these records now available?
→ {"text": "這些紀錄現在可以取得嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. Or have they been taken somewhere, the radar tracks?
→ {"text": "還是說那些雷達追蹤紀錄已經被帶到什麼地方去了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

510. Oh, I've got a copy of the video I took.
→ {"text": "哦，我有我拍攝的錄影帶副本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. I also had the engineers at the tech center produce this chart, and I've got the papers that you can have, anybody that knows anything about automation, they could plot all the airplanes along the route of flight.
→ {"text": "我還請技術中心的工程師製作了這張圖表，而且我有相關文件可以提供，任何懂自動化系統的人都可以沿著飛行路線標繪出所有飛機的位置。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

512. The engineers that did this, they wrote down that this is the first time the UFO showed up, the first time the military's seen the UFO.
→ {"text": "製作這份資料的工程師們記錄下來，這是不明飛行物第一次出現的時間，也是軍方第一次看到不明飛行物的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

513. The pilot at 02-27-06, NORAD called, they lost the target.
→ {"text": "在02:27:06時，NORAD（北美防空司令部）打來電話說他們失去了目標。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

514. They put two sheets of paper like this together on the board.
→ {"text": "他們把兩張像這樣的紙一起貼在展示板上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. They said, "This is what happens."
→ {"text": "他們說：「事情就是這樣發生的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. Now, when I was talking to the engineers, the hardware and software engineers, I asked them to tell me what the target was alongside the 07-47.
→ {"text": "當時我在和工程師們談話，包括硬體和軟體工程師，我請他們告訴我那個在747旁邊的目標是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "07-47 應為 747 客機"}

517. The hardware engineer says, "That target right there is a software problem.
→ {"text": "硬體工程師說：「那個目標是軟體問題。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

518. This one's a software."
→ {"text": "這個也是軟體問題。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

519. All the way down, the targets that showed up were software problems.
→ {"text": "一路看下來，所有出現的目標都被說成是軟體問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

520. The software engineer gets up and says, "This target here is a hardware problem.
→ {"text": "軟體工程師站起來說：「這個目標是硬體問題。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

521. That's a hardware problem."
→ {"text": "那是硬體問題。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

522. My question to them was, "Well, if it's not a hardware problem and it's not a software problem, then what the hell is it?
→ {"text": "我問他們：「嗯，如果這不是硬體問題，也不是軟體問題，那到底是什麼鬼東西？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

523. What are we looking at?"
→ {"text": "我們到底在看什麼？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

524. I'm still thinking it's a stealth bomber.
→ {"text": "我當時還以為那是隱形轟炸機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

525. One of them, he says, "My religion forbids me to believe in UFOs."
→ {"text": "其中一位說：「我的宗教信仰禁止我相信不明飛行物。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

526. I said, "Well, how do you know it ain't a stealth bomber?"
→ {"text": "我說：「嗯，那你怎麼知道它不是隱形轟炸機？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

527. They knew what they were looking at.
→ {"text": "他們知道自己看到了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

528. They knew what they were putting down on the chart, and it was something that didn't belong here in the United States.
→ {"text": "他們知道自己在圖表上記錄的是什麼，而那是不屬於美國的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

529. If you go up and watch radar today, you won't see the UFOs he's shooting across the country.
→ {"text": "如果你現在上去看雷達，你不會看到那些穿越全國的不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

530. He has to slow down to somewhere around 600 knots.
→ {"text": "它必須減速到大約600節左右。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

531. Then, if he stayed with the airline pilot, you would see the airline's target.
→ {"text": "然後，如果它跟著民航機長飛行，你就會看到航空公司的目標標示。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

532. The computer would tell you who it is, it's Transworld, whatever it is, what his speed was, what his altitude was as he's climbing and whatnot.
→ {"text": "電腦會告訴你那是誰，是環球航空，不管是哪家航空公司，它的速度是多少，爬升時的高度是多少等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

533. All that data is on the screen, and next to it would be a dot.
→ {"text": "所有這些資料都顯示在螢幕上，旁邊會有一個小點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

534. Unless the pilot said, "Hey, have you got somebody at my altitude?"
→ {"text": "除非飛行員說：「嘿，你在我這個高度上有看到其他東西嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

535. We would never know that that's what it was.
→ {"text": "否則我們永遠不會知道那是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

536. If he stayed a little bit above that aircraft, he wouldn't see it, wouldn't give it any thought, we would not know.
→ {"text": "如果它飛得比那架飛機高一點，飛行員就看不到它，也不會去想它，我們就不會知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

537. Once the pilot says, "Hey, there's somebody at my altitude here."
→ {"text": "一旦飛行員說：「嘿，我這個高度上有東西。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

538. If it was a Learjet or a military aircraft, had the pilot said, "It looks like an F-106 playing games out here," we would have tracked that little dot all the way until he landed, then we would have rolled him up for flying and controlled airspace without the FAA's approval.
→ {"text": "如果那是里爾噴射機或軍用飛機，飛行員說：「看起來像是一架F-106在這裡玩遊戲」，我們就會一路追蹤那個小點直到它降落，然後我們會因為它在未經 FAA 批准的管制空域飛行而將它攔下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

539. I think you've answered my next question.
→ {"text": "我想您已經回答了我的下一個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

540. That was, how do those who say there is no such thing as this explain it away, and they're explaining it as either a software problem or a hardware problem?
→ {"text": "那就是，那些說沒有這種東西的人是如何敷衍帶過的，而他們把它解釋成要麼是軟體問題，要麼是硬體問題？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

541. That's what the engineers did.
→ {"text": "工程師們就是這麼做的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

542. I gather.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

543. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

544. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

545. Dr. Schreifer, the hills in England and the energy from the hills, can you explain that a bit?
→ {"text": "施賴弗博士，關於英國的土丘以及土丘的能量，您能解釋一下嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Dr. Schreifer 應為 Major Filer 之誤，根據上下文判斷"}

546. Pardon me?
→ {"text": "請再說一遍？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

547. You mentioned hills in England and energy from the hills.
→ {"text": "您提到了英國的土丘以及土丘的能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

548. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

549. We've done some indication that the UFOs may need some kind of electrical and magnetic energy.
→ {"text": "我們有一些跡象顯示，不明飛行物可能需要某種電磁能量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

550. All over the world, there's pyramids or hills or mountainous terrain where they seem to be attracted to and have often been reported in landing on top of these pyramids, that kind of thing.
→ {"text": "世界各地都有金字塔、土丘或山區地形，它們似乎會被這些地方吸引，而且經常有報告說它們降落在金字塔頂端之類的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

551. We're assuming that they may use this as a power station.
→ {"text": "我們推測它們可能把這些地方當作發電站使用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

552. There's books out that indicate that the pyramids actually generate power, that they're power stations in some way.
→ {"text": "有些書籍指出金字塔實際上會產生能量，在某種程度上它們就是發電站。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

553. For example, right now, there's some 200 pyramids in China with flat tops to them, which make them ideal for a craft landing on them.
→ {"text": "例如，現在中國有約200座平頂金字塔，這使它們成為飛行器降落的理想地點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

554. The Chinese are declaring that they're some 10,000 years old.
→ {"text": "中國方面宣稱它們有約10,000年的歷史。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

555. The question is, how did these huge pyramids be built when we were basically not much further along than cavemen?
→ {"text": "問題是，當我們基本上還處於穴居人階段時，這些巨大的金字塔是如何建造的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

556. That's very interesting.
→ {"text": "這非常有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

557. Let me continue a little bit more with this, with Mr. Allen.
→ {"text": "讓我繼續和艾倫先生討論這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

558. You mentioned that they just disappeared?
→ {"text": "您提到它們就這樣消失了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

559. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

560. Just in a flash.
→ {"text": "就一瞬間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

561. It didn't streak off or anything, it simply disappeared.
→ {"text": "它沒有飛走或怎樣，就是單純消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

562. When you saw it take off, there was no propulsion sound, there was no wind sound.
→ {"text": "當您看到它起飛時，沒有推進器的聲音，也沒有風聲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

563. Correct.
→ {"text": "正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

564. No wind noise, no engine noise, nothing.
→ {"text": "沒有風聲，沒有引擎聲，什麼都沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

565. Is anybody speculated on how a large object like that could move so rapidly through the air and have no wind noise?
→ {"text": "有人推測過像這樣巨大的物體如何在空氣中如此快速移動卻沒有風聲嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

566. That's one of our questions, pure speculation.
→ {"text": "這正是我們的問題之一，純粹是推測。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

567. Were these tracked by radar?
→ {"text": "這些有被雷達追蹤到嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

568. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

569. Yes, that's a comprehensive radar report.
→ {"text": "是的，那是一份完整的雷達報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. I think you do have a copy of it.
→ {"text": "我想你們有一份副本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

571. There's something tracked by radar, and people saw it, so you know it's there, and it moves very rapidly, and there's no propulsion sound, and there's no wind sound, there's no propulsion sound, I understand, because we don't know how they propel themselves if it's an anti-gravity thing or something.
→ {"text": "有東西被雷達追蹤到，而且人們也看到了，所以你知道它在那裡，它移動得非常快，而且沒有推進器聲音，也沒有風聲，沒有推進器聲音，我明白，因為我們不知道它們如何推進自己，如果是反重力裝置或什麼的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

572. Obviously, there's going to be no propulsion sound, but you're going through the molecules.
→ {"text": "顯然，不會有推進器聲音，但你是穿過空氣分子的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

573. I don't understand that.
→ {"text": "我不明白這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

574. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

575. Colonel French.
→ {"text": "弗倫奇中校。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

576. I apologize for this, because I had intended to discuss the Phoenix Lights, and by accident, I stepped over that page.
→ {"text": "我很抱歉，因為我本來打算討論鳳凰城光點事件，但不小心跳過了那一頁。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

577. Go ahead and take the rest of my time to discuss the Phoenix Lights.
→ {"text": "請繼續，用我剩下的時間來討論鳳凰城光點事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

578. Go ahead.
→ {"text": "請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. What happened?
→ {"text": "發生了什麼事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

581. This happened in 1997.
→ {"text": "這發生在1997年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

582. I was with four friends, and we were up at an area called the Boulders, which is actually northern Scottsdale, and that was when the Phoenix Lights, where they were explaining what they were, was that they were actually targets for gunnery practice.
→ {"text": "我和四位朋友在一起，我們在Boulders地區，也就是斯科茨代爾北部，那時正是鳳凰城光點事件發生的時候，官方解釋說那些是射擊訓練用的靶標。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. Well, I knew better than that, and I was explaining to them why.
→ {"text": "嗯，我知道不是這樣，而且我正在向他們解釋為什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

584. Number one, one of those target, gunnery targets, they're a flare, and the flare burns for exactly one minute and 21 seconds.
→ {"text": "第一，那些射擊訓練靶標是照明彈，而照明彈燃燒的時間正好是1分21秒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

585. And another thing about them, a gunnery flare may go up or down.
→ {"text": "另外一點，射擊訓練用的照明彈可能會上升或下降。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

586. Now, the reason it would go up, it'll capture heat in the deployed area of the parachute, and it'll rise or it won't capture enough air in it, and then it'll descend and sit.
→ {"text": "它會上升的原因是，它會在降落傘展開的區域捕捉到熱氣，然後上升；或者它沒有捕捉到足夠的空氣，就會下降並懸停。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

587. So I knew, I knew then they couldn't be that.
→ {"text": "所以我知道，我當時就知道那不可能是照明彈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. And I'm telling to my friends, you know, no, they got this all wrong.
→ {"text": "我告訴我的朋友們，你們知道嗎，不，他們完全搞錯了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

589. While I'm in the process of doing that, there was a low spot in the, well, it's a mountain range, but it's not an extreme one.
→ {"text": "就在我這樣說的時候，那裡有一個低窪處，嗯，那是一個山脈，但不是特別險峻的那種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

590. And this UFO came through that cut, and of course there was no lights on it that I could see at that point.
→ {"text": "然後這個不明飛行物從那個缺口飛過來，當然那時我看不到它上面有燈光。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

591. When it went by, and now it's going at this time at about 50 miles an hour, and descending slowly and headed in the direction of Tucson to the south, well, as it got past me in about probably 30 miles down, the lights out on the range, they didn't go out, they stayed on, but they started heading for Tucson.
→ {"text": "當它飛過時，那時它以大約每小時50英里的速度飛行，緩慢下降，朝著南方的圖森方向前進，嗯，當它飛過我，大概在我下方30英里處，那些在山區的光點，它們沒有熄滅，還亮著，但開始朝圖森方向移動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

592. The UFO, now it went by, it made absolutely no sound.
→ {"text": "那個不明飛行物，它飛過時，完全沒有發出任何聲音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

593. It was less than 100 yards from me, and you could hear absolutely nothing, yet the vehicle was actually nearly a mile long and approximately 60 feet in diameter.
→ {"text": "它離我不到100碼，你完全聽不到任何聲音，但這個飛行器實際上將近一英里長，直徑約60英尺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

594. Again, silent, totally silent.
→ {"text": "再次強調，寂靜無聲，完全沒有聲音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

595. When it got in the vicinity of Tucson, the smaller UFOs that were reported to be parachuting, I mean parachute targets, they headed toward Tucson, and at that time I could see on the side of the UFO, like little doors open, they entered the other, we call them mother ships.
→ {"text": "當它接近圖森時，那些據報是降落傘的小不明飛行物，我是說降落傘靶標，它們朝圖森方向飛去，那時我可以看到不明飛行物的側面，像是有小門打開，它們進入另一個，我們稱之為母艦的飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. Anyway, the smaller ones went into the mother ships, the mother ships went, when they got to Tucson, they very quietly disappeared, went right up and out and gone.
→ {"text": "總之，那些小的飛進了母艦，母艦飛到圖森時，非常安靜地消失了，直接向上飛出去就不見了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

597. Thank you so much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
