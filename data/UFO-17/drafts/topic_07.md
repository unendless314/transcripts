## Speaker Group 1

484. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. Mr. Kallen, the event that you describe is exactly the kind of thing that I think is most creditable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. Let me understand, how many different people saw this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. Saw the radar return?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. Well, are there not people that saw the craft and people that saw the radar returns both?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. No, the only ones that saw the craft was the Japanese pilot and the other two with them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. Okay, so there were three people that saw the craft, all right, and how many people saw the radar?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. I don't know, 20, 30.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

492. Twenty-three people?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. These are the kinds of things that are just very difficult to explain away, where you have eyewitnesses and a radar track, and a real radar track, but apparently some of these things don't leave a radar track.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. The other day we had testimony from a pilot in South America that they can absorb bullets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. Something that can absorb bullets can absorb radar, I would think.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. Well, the radar picks up all the traffic, but most people don't understand how the system works and that's what blows their mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. If you're an air traffic controller and you're working your sector in front of you, you've got 500 miles that you're taking care of, the antenna's going by every nine or 10 seconds and it picks up a primary target, which is the size of a pencil eraser, and it puts it on your scope right here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. You could be working traffic going this way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

499. When that target shows up, we don't know who it is, and you're going to look at that and say, "Well, if he gets close to this guy, I'll do something intelligent."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

500. Ten seconds later, that target is over here someplace, nowhere near your traffic, so your mind says it must have been an 18 wheeler, it could be somebody low, I don't know what it was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. The radar always picks up everything flying, but they go so fast that you don't recognize them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

502. Today, to fly in the FAA system, if you're flying below 10,000, you have to stay at 250 knots.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

503. If you're flying above 10,000 or above 18,000, you have to have a working transponder on your aircraft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. That sends out a signal to the radar that says, "This is me," and it shows a different target on the screen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. That's what we see when our people are flying.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. The UFOs don't have transponders, and they don't care about our rules and regulations, they come and go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. I don't know how you're going to solve that problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

508. Are these records now available?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

509. Or have they been taken somewhere, the radar tracks?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. Oh, I've got a copy of the video I took.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. I also had the engineers at the tech center produce this chart, and I've got the papers that you can have, anybody that knows anything about automation, they could plot all the airplanes along the route of flight.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. The engineers that did this, they wrote down that this is the first time the UFO showed up, the first time the military's seen the UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. The pilot at 02-27-06, NORAD called, they lost the target.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. They put two sheets of paper like this together on the board.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. They said, "This is what happens."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. Now, when I was talking to the engineers, the hardware and software engineers, I asked them to tell me what the target was alongside the 07-47.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. The hardware engineer says, "That target right there is a software problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

518. This one's a software."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. All the way down, the targets that showed up were software problems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

520. The software engineer gets up and says, "This target here is a hardware problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. That's a hardware problem."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. My question to them was, "Well, if it's not a hardware problem and it's not a software problem, then what the hell is it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. What are we looking at?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. I'm still thinking it's a stealth bomber.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. One of them, he says, "My religion forbids me to believe in UFOs."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. I said, "Well, how do you know it ain't a stealth bomber?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

527. They knew what they were looking at.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

528. They knew what they were putting down on the chart, and it was something that didn't belong here in the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. If you go up and watch radar today, you won't see the UFOs he's shooting across the country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

530. He has to slow down to somewhere around 600 knots.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. Then, if he stayed with the airline pilot, you would see the airline's target.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. The computer would tell you who it is, it's Transworld, whatever it is, what his speed was, what his altitude was as he's climbing and whatnot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. All that data is on the screen, and next to it would be a dot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. Unless the pilot said, "Hey, have you got somebody at my altitude?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. We would never know that that's what it was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. If he stayed a little bit above that aircraft, he wouldn't see it, wouldn't give it any thought, we would not know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. Once the pilot says, "Hey, there's somebody at my altitude here."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. If it was a Learjet or a military aircraft, had the pilot said, "It looks like an F-106 playing games out here," we would have tracked that little dot all the way until he landed, then we would have rolled him up for flying and controlled airspace without the FAA's approval.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

539. I think you've answered my next question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. That was, how do those who say there is no such thing as this explain it away, and they're explaining it as either a software problem or a hardware problem?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. That's what the engineers did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

542. I gather.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

545. Dr. Schreifer, the hills in England and the energy from the hills, can you explain that a bit?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

546. Pardon me?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. You mentioned hills in England and energy from the hills.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. We've done some indication that the UFOs may need some kind of electrical and magnetic energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. All over the world, there's pyramids or hills or mountainous terrain where they seem to be attracted to and have often been reported in landing on top of these pyramids, that kind of thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. We're assuming that they may use this as a power station.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

552. There's books out that indicate that the pyramids actually generate power, that they're power stations in some way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. For example, right now, there's some 200 pyramids in China with flat tops to them, which make them ideal for a craft landing on them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

554. The Chinese are declaring that they're some 10,000 years old.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

555. The question is, how did these huge pyramids be built when we were basically not much further along than cavemen?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

556. That's very interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

557. Let me continue a little bit more with this, with Mr. Allen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

558. You mentioned that they just disappeared?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

559. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. Just in a flash.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

561. It didn't streak off or anything, it simply disappeared.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

562. When you saw it take off, there was no propulsion sound, there was no wind sound.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

563. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

564. No wind noise, no engine noise, nothing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

565. Is anybody speculated on how a large object like that could move so rapidly through the air and have no wind noise?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

566. That's one of our questions, pure speculation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

567. Were these tracked by radar?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. Yes, that's a comprehensive radar report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

570. I think you do have a copy of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

571. There's something tracked by radar, and people saw it, so you know it's there, and it moves very rapidly, and there's no propulsion sound, and there's no wind sound, there's no propulsion sound, I understand, because we don't know how they propel themselves if it's an anti-gravity thing or something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

572. Obviously, there's going to be no propulsion sound, but you're going through the molecules.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

573. I don't understand that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

574. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

575. Colonel French.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

576. I apologize for this, because I had intended to discuss the Phoenix Lights, and by accident, I stepped over that page.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

577. Go ahead and take the rest of my time to discuss the Phoenix Lights.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

578. Go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

579. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

580. What happened?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. This happened in 1997.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

582. I was with four friends, and we were up at an area called the Boulders, which is actually northern Scottsdale, and that was when the Phoenix Lights, where they were explaining what they were, was that they were actually targets for gunnery practice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

583. Well, I knew better than that, and I was explaining to them why.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

584. Number one, one of those target, gunnery targets, they're a flare, and the flare burns for exactly one minute and 21 seconds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

585. And another thing about them, a gunnery flare may go up or down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

586. Now, the reason it would go up, it'll capture heat in the deployed area of the parachute, and it'll rise or it won't capture enough air in it, and then it'll descend and sit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

587. So I knew, I knew then they couldn't be that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

588. And I'm telling to my friends, you know, no, they got this all wrong.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

589. While I'm in the process of doing that, there was a low spot in the, well, it's a mountain range, but it's not an extreme one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. And this UFO came through that cut, and of course there was no lights on it that I could see at that point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

591. When it went by, and now it's going at this time at about 50 miles an hour, and descending slowly and headed in the direction of Tucson to the south, well, as it got past me in about probably 30 miles down, the lights out on the range, they didn't go out, they stayed on, but they started heading for Tucson.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

592. The UFO, now it went by, it made absolutely no sound.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

593. It was less than 100 yards from me, and you could hear absolutely nothing, yet the vehicle was actually nearly a mile long and approximately 60 feet in diameter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

594. Again, silent, totally silent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. When it got in the vicinity of Tucson, the smaller UFOs that were reported to be parachuting, I mean parachute targets, they headed toward Tucson, and at that time I could see on the side of the UFO, like little doors open, they entered the other, we call them mother ships.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

596. Anyway, the smaller ones went into the mother ships, the mother ships went, when they got to Tucson, they very quietly disappeared, went right up and out and gone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

597. Thank you so much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
