## Speaker Group 1

598. I go to Representative Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

599. First of all, thank you for your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

600. Jim, I'd like to ask you a question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

601. Did people not talk about this because they were afraid for their families?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

602. When did people, when did you start talking to other people about what you saw, what happened?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

603. Probably more after the TV show, UFO Cover Up Live in 1988.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

604. It was kind of the beginning of the, from what I understand, a slow education process for modern times of the public, and there's been, since then it's been easier to talk about this situation with other crew.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

605. Crew members do come up, they've seen me on TV, and they say, "I'm still afraid to talk about it, but let me tell you what happened to me or my father when he was in the military or this or that."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

606. But I'm glad that these shows for the last 20 years on Discovery Channel, Learning Channel, even the show recently that's a series, Ancient Aliens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

607. If you look at things like the Eco Stones of Ica, Peru, very fascinating case with the 50,000 Eco Stones, amazing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

608. I've traveled the world studying these things, and it just gets deeper and deeper and more amazing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

609. But one of the problems with people not being able to accept this, and it is a major issue, is if these entities are getting here, which I, as a person, believe they are, based on my research, they've conquered gravity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

610. Once you conquer gravity, you conquer everything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

611. So there goes the fossil fuel-based economy of the world, and we can go on and on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

612. The religious issues are pretty relevant.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

613. But Carl Sagan on his show, Cosmos, he admitted with 200 billion stars out there in the Drake Equation, they must be out there, but they can't get here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

614. And what's locking that problem is the theory of relativity with Einstein.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

615. So what you really have to kind of take a look is maybe there's something beyond the theory of relativity, and what's faster than the speed of light, thought, from what I understand from scientists that have been involved with these projects is they've, they're thousands of years ahead of us, probably, and they've definitely used some kind of incredible thought process, some kind of inversion energy process to get here, and they basically warp time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

616. So as profound as it sounds, if you told me that 10 years ago, people would be bumping into themselves in an airport terminal like zombies looking down at these devices there, these cell phones, I wouldn't have believed it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

617. And so anything's possible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

618. But we do have, based on what I understand, aircraft called a TR-3B.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

619. There's probably either many other advanced craft that we've developed at some of these installations like 51 or Pine Gap in Australia, possibly, that do hover silently, and they can duplicate some of the technology, but we haven't been able to replicate it 100%.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

620. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

621. I don't know if anyone wants to volunteer for this question, but nobody talks about the sound.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

622. Are there no sounds that you heard when you saw a spaceship or saw a flying object?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

623. Did they make any sounds?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

624. So you have to be, is that why more pilots have seen them than anyone else because you're in the air space with them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

625. Yes, Mr. Piler.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

626. I'd like to answer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

627. I'm with the MUFON organization, and we investigate these sightings, and we get about a thousand sightings per month per month.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

628. And actually, I write about it in my filers' files, which I'm happy to send to anyone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

629. I'm sending out 17,000 emails a week discussing these sightings that we're getting, but generally people say that there's no sound.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

630. Occasionally when the UFO goes right overhead, they can see it go right overhead just a few hundred feet above them, they'll hear what sounds like an electric motor, and that description has been given many times, sometimes a buzz sound, and it's very low, and obviously if you're in an aircraft you wouldn't hear it, or even if it's a little bit further away you wouldn't hear it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

631. The point is that there apparently is, at least on some of the UFOs, a small, almost indistinct sound.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

632. And that's probably to do, like you mentioned, with the overcoming gravity, and it seems to have a lot of electrical energy surrounding it, and not only radar has picked it up, but other types of instruments, for example, just your typical compass that you can buy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

633. In any case, the UFOs nearby, it will usually turn the compass to directly point towards them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

634. Can I give you just a little extra?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

635. Of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

636. Whenever I spoke, I was invited someplace to speak on TV, they always brought in this little Japanese guy who's on Channel 5, Michio Kaku or something like that, he would get up and explain how it's impossible to go from one planet to the other, and he would explain the thousands of light years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

637. Now a few months ago he was on Fox News, and sitting behind him was a picture of the Earth, and they asked him what that was, and he says the Hubble telescope sent this picture back the other day, last week.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

638. He says this is a small planet similar to Earth, it has atmosphere, and it could probably have life on it, and if they were a thousand years older than us, they may have developed some type of travel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

639. A week or two later, he's back on there, and now there's a big Earth right behind him, big Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

640. He says this planet came from the Hubble telescope, it is a hundred times bigger than Earth, and it has atmosphere, and it could have life, and if they were one to two thousand years older than us, they could have developed space travel, and they could do the wormholes, and they could go from place to place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

641. And they said well what else does that tell you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

642. He says well the biggest thing it tells us is that the universe goes on forever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

643. Apparently they had thought before it was like the Earth was flat, and eventually you would run out of the universe, but now he says it goes on forever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

644. And there's two planets that they have identified through the Hubble telescope that have been there longer than us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

645. So you might want to consider that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

646. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

647. May I make one closing remark?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

648. Yes, of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

649. Had I came in here, I was not a skeptic when I came in here, I already believed in them, but I say very clearly that had I been a skeptic when I came in, I would have been convinced by the simple testimony of my cohorts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

650. Let me say that the testimony I think has been outstanding, and your backgrounds and where you come from, and the fact that you are willing to come forward and talk about this I think is a credit to all of you, so thank you for doing that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

651. I have two minutes left, and I'm going to reserve my time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

652. Mr. Thayer?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

653. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

654. I'd like to ask Senator Gravel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

655. Two questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

656. One when we look at the shape of the vehicles that have been observed, the two shapes stand out, one is something flat like a disc, and the other is cigar-shaped.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

657. Could the cigar-shaped, which is substantially different, could it be the angle of observation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

658. Because if you observe a disc shape at a certain angle, it looks cigar-shaped.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

659. Could that be the case, and that we're talking more uniformly about disc shapes than disc and cigar shapes?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

660. Anybody could answer that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

661. One of the pilot reports was on the news for a while, but then the pilots were told to not talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

662. They never gave their names, but they were watching.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

663. They were thousands of feet in the air, 737, and out of the clouds came this giant mile-long cigar-shaped craft, and it was cigar-shaped.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

664. They aren't disc-shaped, so unfortunately, the pilots never wanted to talk about it again after it hit the news, and they played their voice tapes over the television, and they took some heat for it, but thank God I've got Danny Sheehan over there to protect me as a good attorney in case I get in trouble here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

665. You're talking about a cigar-shaped of a mile long.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

666. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

667. We have dozens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

668. It could be a confusion of a contrail, which could be a mile long.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

669. No, and I know you're hearing reports of size of three aircraft carriers, or in my friend's case over the Pacific, they said it was the size of an aircraft carrier, and they're in a 747.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

670. Are they Looney Tunes?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

671. Are they pilots like this movie, Flight with Mr. Washington?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

672. No, the pilots are very serious in their profession, and they know what they see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

673. I can understand where it might look like a disc, but they usually know if it's oval-shaped, spear-shaped, or a mile long.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

674. That's a big exaggeration that a pilot wouldn't make.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

675. I have a boyhood friend who was a captain in Pan Am, and flew the largest of four.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

676. The other thing I want to touch on, which really doesn't surprise me, but maybe a little angers me, and that is the back engineering.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

677. I think you referred to somebody from Lockheed or Grumman or a company saying that they back-engineered what was the debris, or whatever, they got their hands on through the government, and they can take ET home.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

678. That sounds like an exaggeration to me, because if there's a company that's developed a propulsion system equal to what's been observed by all of our witnesses, and based upon Dr. Greer's testimony, we just alter life on this planet if that form of energy is known.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

679. For somebody who's an engineer at a major contracting firm can boast to you or anybody that we can take ET home, then that son of a gun is denying the planet something very vital, and that's what angers me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

680. I question, I think it's boastfulness, but correct me, I give you the opportunity to correct me, was the person who told you that they could take ET home, was he Looney Tunes, or was he a serious engineer, or was he just boasting in your judgment?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

681. Well, he's worked for Lockheed, he was head of Skunk Works, he was in a very important position, and I have friends who were at the briefing where he said this, Jan Harzen at UCLA, and he said it in front of like a hundred engineers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

682. I don't know if he was bragging or not, but he said it very clearly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

683. But the implications of that, now I've met people in very high places that are Looney Tunes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

684. Well, I know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

685. That's not a criteria of credibility, you know, all that is is that he's walking around or she's walking around, but the implication of that is what really must be focused on, is that if somebody who's in any responsible corporate activity, obviously funded by the government to some degree, and can make the statement with any degree of credibility that we can take ET home, then there's grounds for prosecution, you know, or there's grounds for something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

686. It doesn't strike me as a proper assessment, it strikes me as boastfulness, the bravado that exists many times with technicians, or politicians, I just don't want to tag technicians.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

687. Well, obviously what we're studying here has all kinds of implications, and one of the implications that was written about in the Air Force physics books that was taught at the Air Force Academy said that if these craft really exist, and I've seen them and everyone here has seen them, that much of what we have concerning our laws of physics, our laws of biology and so on, are probably incorrect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

688. So you can see how it would affect the whole civilization if it was released to the public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

689. And I agree with that statement, totally, and that's the reason why I questioned the statement that we can take ET home.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

690. Can I give you one more thought?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

691. Assuming that the UFOs are there, correct, they travel from one planet to the other, where they stop for a gas station, what do they do for oil, what do they do for medical, for the people that's there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

692. My own personal thing, there's enough people here in the United States or on this planet that would not want the rest of the people to know how they could get this free power and the better medical stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

693. So some of that's kept aside also.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

694. The companies or the corporations or whoever's in charge, they're not going to want you to know that you can take a toaster and give New York City all the power they want.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

695. They don't want you to know that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

696. They're selling their product and they got to keep control of their product.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

697. They're paying for gas today, almost $5 a gallon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

698. Jim, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

699. The man that the world doesn't give enough credit to that started this in the late 1800s is Nikola Tesla.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

700. He's almost like Forrest Gump.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

701. He was everywhere, working with Edison and Alexander Graham Bell and Einstein.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

702. They finally gave him credit for inventing the radio over Marconi.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

703. I'm sure they're going to give him credit for television, radar, but we would not have the world we have today without his invention of alternating current, but somebody starts needing to educate the kids in college and the world a little better other than that very good show on PBS of the man who created lightning and give this man, whoever he was, credit for the world he brought us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

704. Nikola Tesla, start doing some homework on him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

705. I would only respond to what you had said, John, that was that I found in my life and in my career that there are more conspiracies than people are aware of, but there are less conspiracies than people think.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

706. It sounds like oxymoron, but it is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

707. We can, and of course the audience reacted to your statement in that regard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

708. Sure, there's conspiracies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

709. We know it all the time where new technology is bought up by a corporation because it impacts and we know that the corporate interest is more interested in maximizing the profits from what they already have in place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

710. We see this with refineries, they should be shut down, but they're still making money with them and they're not going to build a new one because they got the old one that they're making more profit on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

711. But you come to the reality, and this is where I come back, something as significant as the unknown, the scientific unknown and the lack of rationale we have to understanding fully what these ETs are all about, and primarily the propulsion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

712. You know, we've seen testimony, it may be thought.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

713. I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

714. I'm not enough scientist, I defer to my colleague, Congressman Barrett, who's a lot more educated in that area, but he comes up with the same queries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

715. I notice our questions are very similar in that regard, but I just want to underscore -- Excuse me, with all due respect, the gentleman's time has expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

716. Well, fine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

717. Good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

718. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
