## Speaker Group 1

598. I go to Representative Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "請 Kilpatrick 眾議員發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

599. First of all, thank you for your testimony.
→ {"text": "首先，感謝各位的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

600. Jim, I'd like to ask you a question.
→ {"text": "Jim，我想請教你一個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

601. Did people not talk about this because they were afraid for their families?
→ {"text": "人們不談論這件事，是因為害怕危及家人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

602. When did people, when did you start talking to other people about what you saw, what happened?
→ {"text": "人們是從什麼時候開始，你又是從什麼時候開始跟別人談論你所看到的、所發生的事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

603. Probably more after the TV show, UFO Cover Up Live in 1988.
→ {"text": "大概是在 1988 年《UFO 真相掩蓋直播》這個電視節目之後，談論的人才比較多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

604. It was kind of the beginning of the, from what I understand, a slow education process for modern times of the public, and there's been, since then it's been easier to talk about this situation with other crew.
→ {"text": "據我所知，這是現代社會對公眾進行緩慢教育過程的開端，從那時起，跟其他機組人員談論這種情況就變得比較容易了。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

605. Crew members do come up, they've seen me on TV, and they say, "I'm still afraid to talk about it, but let me tell you what happened to me or my father when he was in the military or this or that."
→ {"text": "機組人員確實會來找我，他們在電視上看到過我，然後說：「我還是不敢談論這件事，但讓我告訴你發生在我身上的事，或者我父親當年在軍中時發生的事，諸如此類。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

606. But I'm glad that these shows for the last 20 years on Discovery Channel, Learning Channel, even the show recently that's a series, Ancient Aliens.
→ {"text": "但我很高興過去 20 年來，探索頻道、學習頻道，甚至最近播出的系列節目《遠古外星人》這類節目一直在播放。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. If you look at things like the Eco Stones of Ica, Peru, very fascinating case with the 50,000 Eco Stones, amazing.
→ {"text": "如果你看看像秘魯伊卡石刻這樣的東西，那是一個非常引人入勝的案例，有五萬塊伊卡石刻，太驚人了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

608. I've traveled the world studying these things, and it just gets deeper and deeper and more amazing.
→ {"text": "我走遍世界各地研究這些東西，而這個領域越來越深奧，也越來越令人驚嘆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

609. But one of the problems with people not being able to accept this, and it is a major issue, is if these entities are getting here, which I, as a person, believe they are, based on my research, they've conquered gravity.
→ {"text": "但人們無法接受這件事的其中一個問題——這確實是個重大議題——是如果這些實體真的來到這裡，而我個人根據我的研究相信它們確實來了，那麼它們已經征服了重力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

610. Once you conquer gravity, you conquer everything.
→ {"text": "一旦你征服了重力，你就征服了一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

611. So there goes the fossil fuel-based economy of the world, and we can go on and on.
→ {"text": "這樣一來，世界以化石燃料為基礎的經濟體系就會瓦解，而且我們還可以繼續列舉下去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

612. The religious issues are pretty relevant.
→ {"text": "宗教方面的議題也相當相關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

613. But Carl Sagan on his show, Cosmos, he admitted with 200 billion stars out there in the Drake Equation, they must be out there, but they can't get here.
→ {"text": "但卡爾·薩根在他的節目《宇宙》中承認，根據德雷克方程式，外頭有兩千億顆恆星，外星生命一定存在，但他們無法來到這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

614. And what's locking that problem is the theory of relativity with Einstein.
→ {"text": "而限制這個問題的，正是愛因斯坦的相對論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

615. So what you really have to kind of take a look is maybe there's something beyond the theory of relativity, and what's faster than the speed of light, thought, from what I understand from scientists that have been involved with these projects is they've, they're thousands of years ahead of us, probably, and they've definitely used some kind of incredible thought process, some kind of inversion energy process to get here, and they basically warp time.
→ {"text": "所以你真正需要思考的是，也許相對論之外還有其他的東西，而什麼比光速還快？意念。據我從參與這些項目的科學家那裡了解，他們——這些外星生命——可能比我們先進數千年，而且他們肯定使用了某種不可思議的意念過程，某種反轉能量過程來到這裡，他們基本上是在扭曲時間。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

616. So as profound as it sounds, if you told me that 10 years ago, people would be bumping into themselves in an airport terminal like zombies looking down at these devices there, these cell phones, I wouldn't have believed it.
→ {"text": "所以這聽起來很深刻，但如果十年前你告訴我，人們會像殭屍一樣在機場航廈裡低頭盯著這些裝置——這些手機——互相碰撞，我是不會相信的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

617. And so anything's possible.
→ {"text": "所以任何事都是可能的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

618. But we do have, based on what I understand, aircraft called a TR-3B.
→ {"text": "但根據我的了解，我們確實擁有一種稱為 TR-3B 三角飛行器的飛機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

619. There's probably either many other advanced craft that we've developed at some of these installations like 51 or Pine Gap in Australia, possibly, that do hover silently, and they can duplicate some of the technology, but we haven't been able to replicate it 100%.
→ {"text": "可能還有許多其他我們在類似 51 區或澳洲松峽基地這樣的設施中研發的先進飛行器，它們能夠靜音懸停，而且可以複製部分技術，但我們還無法百分之百複製。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

620. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

621. I don't know if anyone wants to volunteer for this question, but nobody talks about the sound.
→ {"text": "我不知道有沒有人想主動回答這個問題，但沒有人談論聲音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

622. Are there no sounds that you heard when you saw a spaceship or saw a flying object?
→ {"text": "當你們看到太空船或飛行物體時，都沒有聽到任何聲音嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

623. Did they make any sounds?
→ {"text": "它們有發出任何聲音嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

624. So you have to be, is that why more pilots have seen them than anyone else because you're in the air space with them?
→ {"text": "所以你們必須在空中，這就是為什麼飛行員比其他人更容易看到它們的原因嗎？因為你們和它們在同一個空域？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

625. Yes, Mr. Piler.
→ {"text": "是的，費勒先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

626. I'd like to answer.
→ {"text": "我想回答這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

627. I'm with the MUFON organization, and we investigate these sightings, and we get about a thousand sightings per month per month.
→ {"text": "我是 MUFON（UFO 互動網絡）組織的成員，我們調查這些目擊事件，每個月大約收到一千起目擊報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

628. And actually, I write about it in my filers' files, which I'm happy to send to anyone.
→ {"text": "事實上，我在我的 Filer's Files 中通訊中撰寫這些內容，我很樂意寄給任何有興趣的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

629. I'm sending out 17,000 emails a week discussing these sightings that we're getting, but generally people say that there's no sound.
→ {"text": "我每週發送一萬七千封電子郵件，討論我們收到的這些目擊報告，但一般來說，人們都說沒有聲音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

630. Occasionally when the UFO goes right overhead, they can see it go right overhead just a few hundred feet above them, they'll hear what sounds like an electric motor, and that description has been given many times, sometimes a buzz sound, and it's very low, and obviously if you're in an aircraft you wouldn't hear it, or even if it's a little bit further away you wouldn't hear it.
→ {"text": "偶爾當不明飛行物正好從頭頂飛過時，他們可以看到它就在他們上方幾百英尺處飛過，這時他們會聽到類似電動馬達的聲音，這種描述已經出現過很多次，有時是一種嗡嗡聲，而且聲音非常低，顯然如果你在飛機裡面是聽不到的，或者即使距離稍微遠一點也聽不到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

631. The point is that there apparently is, at least on some of the UFOs, a small, almost indistinct sound.
→ {"text": "重點是，顯然至少在某些不明飛行物上，會有一種微弱、幾乎難以辨識的聲音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

632. And that's probably to do, like you mentioned, with the overcoming gravity, and it seems to have a lot of electrical energy surrounding it, and not only radar has picked it up, but other types of instruments, for example, just your typical compass that you can buy.
→ {"text": "這可能與你提到的克服重力有關，而且它似乎周圍有大量電能，不僅雷達能偵測到，其他類型的儀器也可以，例如一般市面上買得到的普通指南針。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

633. In any case, the UFOs nearby, it will usually turn the compass to directly point towards them.
→ {"text": "無論如何，當不明飛行物在附近時，指南針通常會轉向直接指向它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

634. Can I give you just a little extra?
→ {"text": "我可以補充一點嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

635. Of course.
→ {"text": "當然可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

636. Whenever I spoke, I was invited someplace to speak on TV, they always brought in this little Japanese guy who's on Channel 5, Michio Kaku or something like that, he would get up and explain how it's impossible to go from one planet to the other, and he would explain the thousands of light years.
→ {"text": "每次我被邀請到電視上發言，他們總是會請來第五頻道那個矮個子的日本傢伙，加來道雄之類的，他會起身解釋為什麼從一個星球到另一個星球是不可能的，他會解釋那數千光年的距離。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

637. Now a few months ago he was on Fox News, and sitting behind him was a picture of the Earth, and they asked him what that was, and he says the Hubble telescope sent this picture back the other day, last week.
→ {"text": "幾個月前，他在 Fox 新聞台露面，他身後放著一張地球的照片，他們問他那是什麼，他說這是哈伯望遠鏡前幾天、上週傳回來的照片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

638. He says this is a small planet similar to Earth, it has atmosphere, and it could probably have life on it, and if they were a thousand years older than us, they may have developed some type of travel.
→ {"text": "他說這是一顆類似地球的小型行星，有大氣層，上面可能有生命，如果他們比我們先進一千年，他們可能已經發展出某種旅行方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

639. A week or two later, he's back on there, and now there's a big Earth right behind him, big Earth.
→ {"text": "一兩週後，他又上節目了，這次他身後是一顆巨大的地球，很大的地球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

640. He says this planet came from the Hubble telescope, it is a hundred times bigger than Earth, and it has atmosphere, and it could have life, and if they were one to two thousand years older than us, they could have developed space travel, and they could do the wormholes, and they could go from place to place.
→ {"text": "他說這顆行星是哈伯望遠鏡發現的，比地球大一百倍，有大氣層，可能有生命，如果他們比我們先進一到兩千年，他們可能已經發展出太空旅行技術，他們可以利用蟲洞，從一個地方前往另一個地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

641. And they said well what else does that tell you?
→ {"text": "他們問他，這還告訴我們什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

642. He says well the biggest thing it tells us is that the universe goes on forever.
→ {"text": "他說，最重要的是它告訴我們宇宙是無限延伸的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

643. Apparently they had thought before it was like the Earth was flat, and eventually you would run out of the universe, but now he says it goes on forever.
→ {"text": "顯然他們以前的想法就像地球是平的一樣，最終你會走到宇宙的盡頭，但現在他說宇宙是無限延伸的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

644. And there's two planets that they have identified through the Hubble telescope that have been there longer than us.
→ {"text": "而且透過哈伯望遠鏡，他們已經確認有兩顆行星存在的時間比我們地球更久。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

645. So you might want to consider that.
→ {"text": "所以你們或許可以考慮這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

646. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

647. May I make one closing remark?
→ {"text": "我可以做一個結語嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

648. Yes, of course.
→ {"text": "是的，當然可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

649. Had I came in here, I was not a skeptic when I came in here, I already believed in them, but I say very clearly that had I been a skeptic when I came in, I would have been convinced by the simple testimony of my cohorts.
→ {"text": "我進來這裡的時候，我本來就不是懷疑論者，我已經相信這些事情了，但我要非常清楚地說，如果我進來時是個懷疑論者，我也會被我的同僚們簡單的證詞所說服。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

650. Let me say that the testimony I think has been outstanding, and your backgrounds and where you come from, and the fact that you are willing to come forward and talk about this I think is a credit to all of you, so thank you for doing that.
→ {"text": "我要說，我認為各位的證詞非常出色，你們的背景和來歷，以及你們願意挺身而出談論這件事的事實，我認為這是對你們所有人的讚譽，所以感謝你們這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

651. I have two minutes left, and I'm going to reserve my time.
→ {"text": "我還有兩分鐘，我要保留我的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

652. Mr. Thayer?
→ {"text": "Thayer 先生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

653. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

654. I'd like to ask Senator Gravel.
→ {"text": "我想請教 Gravel 參議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

655. Two questions.
→ {"text": "兩個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

656. One when we look at the shape of the vehicles that have been observed, the two shapes stand out, one is something flat like a disc, and the other is cigar-shaped.
→ {"text": "第一個問題，當我們觀察被目擊到的飛行器形狀時，有兩種形狀特別突出，一種是像圓盤一樣扁平的東西，另一種是雪茄形狀的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

657. Could the cigar-shaped, which is substantially different, could it be the angle of observation?
→ {"text": "雪茄形狀的飛行器與圓盤形狀明顯不同，這會不會只是觀察角度的問題？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

658. Because if you observe a disc shape at a certain angle, it looks cigar-shaped.
→ {"text": "因為如果你從某個角度觀察圓盤形狀，它看起來就像是雪茄形狀的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

659. Could that be the case, and that we're talking more uniformly about disc shapes than disc and cigar shapes?
→ {"text": "有沒有可能是這樣，我們談論的其實更統一的是圓盤形狀，而不是圓盤和雪茄形狀都有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

660. Anybody could answer that.
→ {"text": "任何人都可以回答這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

661. One of the pilot reports was on the news for a while, but then the pilots were told to not talk about it.
→ {"text": "其中一份飛行員報告曾經在新聞上報導過一段時間，但後來飛行員被告知不要談論這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. They never gave their names, but they were watching.
→ {"text": "他們從未透露姓名，但他們正在觀察。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

663. They were thousands of feet in the air, 737, and out of the clouds came this giant mile-long cigar-shaped craft, and it was cigar-shaped.
→ {"text": "他們在數千英尺的高空，駕駛 737 客機，然後從雲層中出現了一艘巨大的、一英里長的雪茄形飛行器，而且它確實是雪茄形狀的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

664. They aren't disc-shaped, so unfortunately, the pilots never wanted to talk about it again after it hit the news, and they played their voice tapes over the television, and they took some heat for it, but thank God I've got Danny Sheehan over there to protect me as a good attorney in case I get in trouble here.
→ {"text": "它們不是圓盤形狀的，所以不幸的是，這件事上新聞後，飛行員們再也不想談論這件事了，而且他們的語音錄音在電視上播放了，他們因此承受了一些壓力，但感謝上帝，我有 Danny Sheehan 在那邊保護我，作為一名好律師，以防我在這裡惹上麻煩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

665. You're talking about a cigar-shaped of a mile long.
→ {"text": "你說的是一英里長的雪茄形飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

666. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

667. We have dozens.
→ {"text": "我們有幾十起這樣的報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

668. It could be a confusion of a contrail, which could be a mile long.
→ {"text": "這可能會與凝結尾混淆，凝結尾也可能長達一英里。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

669. No, and I know you're hearing reports of size of three aircraft carriers, or in my friend's case over the Pacific, they said it was the size of an aircraft carrier, and they're in a 747.
→ {"text": "不，而且我知道你也聽過大小相當於三艘航空母艦的報告，或者以我朋友在太平洋上空的經歷來說，他們說那東西有一艘航空母艦那麼大，而他們當時在 747 客機上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

670. Are they Looney Tunes?
→ {"text": "他們是瘋了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

671. Are they pilots like this movie, Flight with Mr. Washington?
→ {"text": "他們是像《機長》這部電影裡 Washington 先生飾演的那種飛行員嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

672. No, the pilots are very serious in their profession, and they know what they see.
→ {"text": "不，飛行員對他們的職業非常認真，而且他們知道自己看到了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

673. I can understand where it might look like a disc, but they usually know if it's oval-shaped, spear-shaped, or a mile long.
→ {"text": "我可以理解有時候看起來可能像圓盤，但他們通常能分辨它是橢圓形、矛形，還是一英里長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

674. That's a big exaggeration that a pilot wouldn't make.
→ {"text": "這種誇大的說法是飛行員不會說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

675. I have a boyhood friend who was a captain in Pan Am, and flew the largest of four.
→ {"text": "我有一個兒時好友是泛美航空的機長，飛過四種機型中最大的那一種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

676. The other thing I want to touch on, which really doesn't surprise me, but maybe a little angers me, and that is the back engineering.
→ {"text": "另一件我想談的事，這件事其實並不讓我驚訝，但可能有點讓我憤怒，那就是反向工程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

677. I think you referred to somebody from Lockheed or Grumman or a company saying that they back-engineered what was the debris, or whatever, they got their hands on through the government, and they can take ET home.
→ {"text": "我想你提到過洛克希德公司或格魯曼公司或其他公司的某個人說，他們對政府交給他們的殘骸或其他東西進行了反向工程，而且他們可以帶 ET 回家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

678. That sounds like an exaggeration to me, because if there's a company that's developed a propulsion system equal to what's been observed by all of our witnesses, and based upon Dr. Greer's testimony, we just alter life on this planet if that form of energy is known.
→ {"text": "對我來說這聽起來像是誇大其詞，因為如果有一家公司開發出了相當於我們所有證人所觀察到的推進系統，而且根據格里爾博士的證詞，如果這種能量形式被公開，我們將會徹底改變這個星球上的生活。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

679. For somebody who's an engineer at a major contracting firm can boast to you or anybody that we can take ET home, then that son of a gun is denying the planet something very vital, and that's what angers me.
→ {"text": "如果一家大型承包公司的工程師能向你或任何人吹噓說我們可以帶 ET 回家，那麼那個混蛋就是在剝奪這個星球上非常重要的東西，這就是讓我憤怒的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

680. I question, I think it's boastfulness, but correct me, I give you the opportunity to correct me, was the person who told you that they could take ET home, was he Looney Tunes, or was he a serious engineer, or was he just boasting in your judgment?
→ {"text": "我質疑這一點，我認為這是吹牛，但請糾正我，我給你機會糾正我，那個告訴你他們可以帶 ET 回家的人，他是瘋了，還是他是個認真的工程師，或者在你看來他只是在吹牛？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

681. Well, he's worked for Lockheed, he was head of Skunk Works, he was in a very important position, and I have friends who were at the briefing where he said this, Jan Harzen at UCLA, and he said it in front of like a hundred engineers.
→ {"text": "嗯，他曾在洛克希德公司工作，他是臭鼬工廠的主管，他身居要職，而且我有朋友參加了他說這番話的簡報會，UCLA 的 Jan Harzen 也在場，他是在大約一百名工程師面前說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

682. I don't know if he was bragging or not, but he said it very clearly.
→ {"text": "我不知道他是否在吹牛，但他說得非常清楚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

683. But the implications of that, now I've met people in very high places that are Looney Tunes.
→ {"text": "但這件事的影響是，我見過很多身居高位的人，他們也是瘋子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

684. Well, I know.
→ {"text": "嗯，我知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

685. That's not a criteria of credibility, you know, all that is is that he's walking around or she's walking around, but the implication of that is what really must be focused on, is that if somebody who's in any responsible corporate activity, obviously funded by the government to some degree, and can make the statement with any degree of credibility that we can take ET home, then there's grounds for prosecution, you know, or there's grounds for something.
→ {"text": "這不是可信度的標準，你知道，他或她只是在那裡走來走去，但真正必須關注的是這件事的影響，那就是如果某個從事任何負責任企業活動的人，顯然在某種程度上受到政府資助，而且能夠以任何程度的可信度聲稱我們可以帶 ET 回家，那麼這就有起訴的理由，你知道，或者有採取某種行動的理由。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

686. It doesn't strike me as a proper assessment, it strikes me as boastfulness, the bravado that exists many times with technicians, or politicians, I just don't want to tag technicians.
→ {"text": "這在我看來不是一個適當的評估，在我看來這是吹牛，是技術人員或政客經常表現出的那種虛張聲勢，我只是不想特別指責技術人員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

687. Well, obviously what we're studying here has all kinds of implications, and one of the implications that was written about in the Air Force physics books that was taught at the Air Force Academy said that if these craft really exist, and I've seen them and everyone here has seen them, that much of what we have concerning our laws of physics, our laws of biology and so on, are probably incorrect.
→ {"text": "嗯，顯然我們在這裡研究的東西有各種各樣的影響，其中一個影響寫在空軍學院教授的空軍物理教科書中，書中說如果這些飛行器真的存在——而我見過它們，這裡的每個人都見過它們——那麼我們現有的許多關於物理定律、生物定律等等的認知，可能都是不正確的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

688. So you can see how it would affect the whole civilization if it was released to the public.
→ {"text": "所以你可以想像，如果這些資訊向公眾公開，將會如何影響整個文明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

689. And I agree with that statement, totally, and that's the reason why I questioned the statement that we can take ET home.
→ {"text": "我完全同意這個說法，這就是為什麼我質疑「我們可以帶 ET 回家」這個聲明的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

690. Can I give you one more thought?
→ {"text": "我可以再補充一個想法嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

691. Assuming that the UFOs are there, correct, they travel from one planet to the other, where they stop for a gas station, what do they do for oil, what do they do for medical, for the people that's there?
→ {"text": "假設不明飛行物確實存在，沒錯，它們從一個星球旅行到另一個星球，它們在哪裡停靠加油站？它們如何獲取石油？它們如何獲得醫療？對於在那裡的人們呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

692. My own personal thing, there's enough people here in the United States or on this planet that would not want the rest of the people to know how they could get this free power and the better medical stuff.
→ {"text": "我個人的看法是，在美國或這個星球上有足夠多的人不希望其他人知道如何獲得這種免費能源和更好的醫療技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

693. So some of that's kept aside also.
→ {"text": "所以這些東西也被隱瞞起來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

694. The companies or the corporations or whoever's in charge, they're not going to want you to know that you can take a toaster and give New York City all the power they want.
→ {"text": "那些公司或企業，或者任何掌權的人，他們不會想讓你知道你可以用一個烤麵包機就提供紐約市所需的所有電力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

695. They don't want you to know that.
→ {"text": "他們不想讓你知道這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

696. They're selling their product and they got to keep control of their product.
→ {"text": "他們在販售他們的產品，而且他們必須保持對產品的控制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

697. They're paying for gas today, almost $5 a gallon.
→ {"text": "他們現在加油要付將近每加侖五美元。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

698. Jim, please.
→ {"text": "Jim，請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

699. The man that the world doesn't give enough credit to that started this in the late 1800s is Nikola Tesla.
→ {"text": "這個世界沒有給予足夠肯定的人，就是在 19 世紀末開創這一切的尼古拉·特斯拉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

700. He's almost like Forrest Gump.
→ {"text": "他幾乎就像阿甘一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

701. He was everywhere, working with Edison and Alexander Graham Bell and Einstein.
