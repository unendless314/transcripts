771. I would say the reason I've stuck in this so long and stuck my neck out so far is not just about losing a career, but it's because there are certain things that I've been privy to to keep me going, but at this point I can't get into that, and I wish I could.

791. Or it might have been the gentleman.

→ {"text": "有一件事，我要以此作為結束，就是從本週我們聽到的科學、智慧的討論、證詞和演講中浮現出來的是，無論外面有什麼東西，外星不明飛行物，我還沒有定義其中的差異，我知道有一些相似之處，也有一些不同之處，它們遠比我們今天的科技更先進，能夠做到更多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

800. The ships, the UFOs speeding up and stopping and turning and all the things that we haven't yet mastered that, that doesn't mean that we can't, or that it doesn't exist.

→ {"text": "我想約翰·卡拉漢 (John Callahan) 有一些很好的資訊，說明為什麼雷達可能沒有偵測到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "如果雷達沒有偵測到，這是否會降低這個物體可能來自外星的說法的可信度？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

826. Well, obviously, we have stealth technology now, where that came from, I'm not going to speculate on, but I know they just had a site, it's in the news this week, Airbus Aircraft British coming into Glasgow, Scotland, December 2nd, and it just broke in the news yesterday or two days ago, and they were at 4,000 feet, and this disc-shaped thing came under them with, you know, strange lights and all that, and they never got any warning from their TCAS system or wasn't on radar.

828. Richard Haynes is the -- he's the ex-NASA expert on this, and he's -- all his books and studies for years are on pilot sightings, and one of the strangest cases was this Melbourne episode in 1978 where the pilot on a Cessna 182 disappeared after he was talking on terror traffic control about this craft coming down bright light during the day, and they did have radar -- somebody got hold of the tapes from Pine Gap, Australia, our space monitoring agency down there, showing something coming at him, and then they never found any wreckage.
→ {"text": "理查德·海恩斯 (Richard Haynes) 是——他是 NASA 前專家，他多年來所有的書籍和研究都是關於飛行員目擊事件，其中最奇怪的案件之一就是 1978 年的墨爾本失蹤事件 (Melbourne episode)，當時一名駕駛 Cessna 182 飛機的飛行員在與航空管制通話時，談論這個在白天降下明亮光線的飛行物後就失蹤了，他們確實有雷達——有人拿到了澳洲松峽基地 (Pine Gap) 的錄音帶，那是我們在澳洲的太空監測機構，顯示有東西朝他飛去，然後他們再也沒有找到任何殘骸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

834. Mr. Callahan, we've been talking about radar.
→ {"text": "卡拉漢先生，我們一直在談論雷達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

835. You seem to know a lot about radar, probably the -- probably more about radar than any other expert we've heard this week.
→ {"text": "你似乎對雷達很了解，可能——可能比我們本週聽到的任何其他專家都更了解雷達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

836. I think -- and that's not just a compliment.
→ {"text": "我認為——這不只是讚美。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

837. I think it's a fact from everything I've heard, at least.
→ {"text": "至少從我聽到的一切來看，我認為這是事實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

838. The question I've asked is you gave some -- repeat, just very briefly, why you think radar does not show up in some of these sightings.
→ {"text": "我問的問題是，你給了一些——重複一下，非常簡短地，為什麼你認為雷達在某些目擊事件中沒有顯示。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

839. Well, the radar always shows up, but you can't see it.
→ {"text": "嗯，雷達總是會顯示，但你看不到它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

840. That's the problem.
→ {"text": "這就是問題所在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

841. Oh, okay.
→ {"text": "哦，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

842. You've got to remember now if a UFO or even a Russian or some other come into our air space without a working transponder, then the computer would recognize that little dot that the radar picks up as nothing.
→ {"text": "你必須記住，如果一個不明飛行物，甚至是俄羅斯或其他國家的飛行物，進入我們的空域而沒有運作中的航空應答機 (transponder)，那麼電腦會將雷達捕捉到的那個小點識別為無物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

843. And if it was a huge mass of raw radar, our system says it can't be an airplane.
→ {"text": "如果是一個巨大的原始雷達回波，我們的系統會說這不可能是飛機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

844. It must be weather.
→ {"text": "這一定是天氣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

845. So it puts it on what they call the WIFMU, Weather Fixed Mapping Unit, and it tells the computer says I'll put it on the scope as a cloud unless the controller says I don't want to see the weather.
→ {"text": "所以它會把它放到他們所謂的 WIFMU（氣象固定測繪單元）上，它告訴電腦說我會把它顯示在螢幕上作為雲朵，除非管制員說我不想看到天氣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

846. And if that's the case, it shows up.
→ {"text": "如果是這種情況，它就會顯示出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

847. Well, I'm glad I asked you this because, at least for my benefit, this has certainly illuminated the understanding.
→ {"text": "嗯，我很高興我問了你這個問題，因為至少對我來說，這確實澄清了理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

848. And so it would not be fair to say if something did -- go ahead.
→ {"text": "所以如果說某個東西確實——請繼續。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

849. A number of military radar operators and FAA radar operators have called me.
→ {"text": "許多軍方雷達操作員和 FAA 雷達操作員打電話給我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

850. And basically, what they said was that they were told not to tell the pilots that there was a UFO out there.
→ {"text": "基本上，他們說他們被告知不要告訴飛行員外面有不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

851. Always deny the fact the UFO exists and turn the aircraft away so there, you know, there's no chance of hitting it or whatever.
→ {"text": "總是否認不明飛行物存在的事實，並讓飛機轉向，這樣，你知道，就沒有撞擊它的機會或其他什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

852. The point is, is that the -- I don't think there's any radar people here, but that's what I've been told.
→ {"text": "重點是，我認為這裡沒有雷達人員，但這就是我所聽到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

853. Also, they -- I understand there's some way that they program the computer so they're less likely to show the UFOs because they're usually moving at very low altitude or very high altitude at very high speeds.
→ {"text": "另外，他們——我了解他們有某種方式編程電腦，使其不太可能顯示不明飛行物，因為它們通常在非常低或非常高的高度以非常高的速度移動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

854. And the tendency for the radar not to pick them up.
→ {"text": "而雷達傾向於無法捕捉到它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

855. But if you go back to the raw radar data, you can get it -- And I see now -- excuse me.
→ {"text": "但如果你回到原始雷達數據，你可以得到它——而我現在看到——抱歉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

856. I hate to do this.
→ {"text": "我不想這麼做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

857. I really do because I love what you're -- to give you this information, but my time has expired.
→ {"text": "我真的不想，因為我喜歡你——給你這些資訊，但我的時間已經到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

858. Oh, it's too bad.
→ {"text": "哦，太可惜了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

859. I think I'm next.

860. Yes.

862. Go ahead, you have, in fact, four minutes.
→ {"text": "請說，實際上你有四分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

863. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

864. Pilot Courant, can you -- you mentioned in your testimony that you had -- you and a group had met with a group of representatives on the Hill.
→ {"text": "庫蘭特機長，你——你在證詞中提到你——你和一群人曾與國會山莊的一群議員會面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

866. And this was 20 years ago.

867. There were private meetings where I'd met these people on flights and we got talking and they invited me to meet them on the subject.

869. Some of them are still active.

870. Well, so, you know, oh, it was on the airplane.
→ {"text": "嗯，所以，你知道，哦，是在飛機上認識的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

871. It was not in their office.
→ {"text": "不是在他們的辦公室。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

872. They invited me into their office after I met them on their flights.

876. They work for everybody out there.

877. They don't -- but you don't have to tell who they are.
→ {"text": "他們不——但你不必說出他們是誰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

878. But they would be -- if you would let -- if they were as interested as you say, if somebody in the paradigm group or this -- the organizers here knew who they were, that might be a first step for us to get this back onto the radar of the Congress to ask for a hearing.
→ {"text": "但他們會——如果你願意——如果他們像你所說的那樣感興趣，如果典範小組或這裡的組織者知道他是誰，這可能是我們讓這個議題重新進入國會視線、要求舉行聽證會的第一步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

879. That's -- I mean, that would be -- you've got to find this -- we've got to find the thread.

880. You'd think we'd know.

881. But we don't know the person that's going to be willing to do that.

883. It would be a start.
→ {"text": "這會是一個開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

884. I wish it was that easy, but even you folks the other day said if you were active in Congress or Senate at this time, you probably wouldn't ask for a hearing on this.
→ {"text": "我希望有那麼簡單，但即使是你們這些人，前幾天也說如果你們現在活躍在國會或參議院，你們可能不會要求就此舉行聽證會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

885. Well, I probably would on the science committee because that would be the perfect committee for this because it's not a very -- it's not really political and -- but I mean, after this week, I would now that I've got information.
→ {"text": "嗯，我可能會在科學委員會這麼做，因為那會是最適合的委員會，因為這不是很——這不是真的政治性的——但我是說，在這個星期之後，我現在有了資訊，我會這麼做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

886. No, I -- on one of my flights, I asked -- it kind of went the wrong way where I asked the senator -- he was friends with some非常富有的朋友 of mine, and they were main campaign fundraisers.
→ {"text": "不，我——在一次飛行中，我問了——結果有點走偏了，我問了那位參議員——他和我一些非常富有的朋友是朋友，他們是主要的競選募款人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

887. So we got talking, and it was just he and I in the -- out in the waiting area before his flight.
→ {"text": "所以我們聊了起來，只有他和我——在他的航班起飛前的候機區。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

888. And I asked him, "Senator, do you think there's a chance of ever having another congressional hearing like 1968 with Gerald Ford?"
→ {"text": "我問他：「參議員，你認為還有機會再舉行一次像 1968 年那樣的國會聽證會嗎，就像傑拉爾德·福特 (Gerald Ford) 那時候？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

889. And he said, "No, never.
→ {"text": "他說：「不，永遠不會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

890. It's all been explained away.
→ {"text": "一切都已經被解釋掉了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

891. There's no need for that."
→ {"text": "沒有這個必要。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

892. There's only one of them, but I just thought maybe you'd found somebody that had some interest.
→ {"text": "只有一個人這麼說，但我只是以為也許你找到了某個有興趣的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

893. Can I -- Oh, there is.

894. They're still active, the people there.

896. And I want to make -- Well, I started -- I have a minute. -- the military is in charge of control.
→ {"text": "我想說——嗯，我開始說——我還有一分鐘。——軍方負責管制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

897. I started with the FAA when it was known as the CAA before radar when controlled with strips.
→ {"text": "我開始在 FAA 工作時，它還被稱為 CAA（民航局），那時還沒有雷達，是用紙條管制的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

898. When they brought the first radar unit into the facility, it was an old VG scope that the Navy used to use.
→ {"text": "當他們把第一台雷達設備帶進設施時，那是海軍以前用的老式 VG 示波器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

899. And the instructions was 26 pages, and nobody knew how to use radar.
→ {"text": "說明書有 26 頁，沒有人知道如何使用雷達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

900. We started off with what they had was just a broadband radar, raw radar.
→ {"text": "我們開始時他們只有寬頻雷達，原始雷達。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

901. And eventually, they were able to draw airways on this VG scope that we're looking at.
→ {"text": "最終，他們能夠在這個 VG 示波器上畫出航路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

902. We had to do all kinds of things when the pilot called on the frequency, and he's approaching Harrisonburg, you look down there, and there's like 15 people all in that area.
→ {"text": "當飛行員呼叫頻率，他正接近哈里森堡時，我們必須做各種事情，你看下面，那個區域有大概 15 架飛機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

903. So you would tell them to make a right turn, 30 degrees for 30 seconds, then resume your navigation, and you would look to see who's turning.
→ {"text": "所以你會告訴他們向右轉 30 度，持續 30 秒，然後恢復導航，你會觀察誰在轉彎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

904. Sometimes, two or three people would turn, because sometimes the pilots have a real sense of humor.
→ {"text": "有時候，兩三架飛機會轉彎，因為有時候飛行員真的很有幽默感。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

905. And eventually, you give this guy a couple turns, and you'd pick him up and say, "He's there."
→ {"text": "最終，你讓這傢伙轉幾次彎，你就會找到他並說：「他在那裡。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

906. It's a primary target.

907. It's only a dash.
→ {"text": "這只是一個短線。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

908. We had all kinds of trouble keeping them separated from one another, because they weren't all flying under the FAA control.
→ {"text": "我們在讓它們彼此保持距離方面遇到各種麻煩，因為它們並不都在 FAA 管制下飛行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

909. They invented the transponder, and they made it mandatory that you have to have a transponder to fly above certain altitudes.
→ {"text": "他們發明了航空應答機 (transponder)，並規定在某些高度以上飛行必須配備應答機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

910. The transponder now gives a signal so that you'll always see the target.
→ {"text": "現在應答機會發出訊號，這樣你就能一直看到目標。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

911. But if there's somebody flying alongside of them that doesn't have a transponder, he shows up as a dot.
→ {"text": "但如果有人飛在他們旁邊而沒有應答機，他就會顯示為一個點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

912. The dot is always there.
→ {"text": "那個點一直在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

913. If it's a UFO, and he's traveling at 3,000, 4,000 miles an hour, when you look at your scope, you see him here, okay?
→ {"text": "如果是不明飛行物，它以每小時 3，000、4，000 英里的速度飛行，當你看你的螢幕時，你看到他在這裡，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

914. Ten seconds later, he's over here.
→ {"text": "10 秒鐘後，他在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

915. He's nowhere near your area that you're controlling traffic on.
→ {"text": "他離你管制交通的區域很遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

916. You get one hit, maybe two.
→ {"text": "你得到一次回波，也許兩次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

917. He gets one hit on his sector, and it's gone.
→ {"text": "他在他的扇區得到一次回波，然後就消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

918. He wouldn't know that was a UFO.
→ {"text": "他不會知道那是不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

919. And as long as I've been in the FAA, and I had worked up to the position where I was, the guy in charge of all the air traffic people in the United States, if they screwed up on their phraseology, it was my fault.
→ {"text": "而且我在 FAA 工作期間，我一直升到我當時的職位，負責管理全美國所有空中交通管制人員，如果他們在用語上出錯，那是我的錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

920. That was the new thing after the strike.
→ {"text": "那是罷工之後的新規定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

921. So I knew everything, and we did everything.
→ {"text": "所以我知道一切，我們做了一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

922. We never told our controllers not to report a UFO.
→ {"text": "我們從未告訴我們的管制員不要報告不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

923. We did tell them not to solicit a near miss report, because when you bring two airplanes too close together, they would file what we called a near miss.
→ {"text": "我們確實告訴他們不要主動詢問險撞報告，因為當你讓兩架飛機靠得太近時，他們會提交我們所謂的險撞報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

924. Well they were getting too many near misses, so they said, "Do not ask the pilot if he wants to file a near miss.
→ {"text": "嗯，他們收到太多險撞報告了，所以他們說：「不要問飛行員是否想提交險撞報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

925. When he gets on the ground, he can do it."
→ {"text": "當他降落後，他可以自己做。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

926. But that's the only thing we restricted of filing, was a near miss report, not a UFO.
→ {"text": "但這是我們唯一限制提交的報告，是險撞報告，不是不明飛行物報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

927. And I see that our time for this panel has expired.
→ {"text": "我看到我們這個小組的時間已經到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

928. I want to thank the panel.
