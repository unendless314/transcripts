## Speaker Group 1

719. We could go to Representative Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

720. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

721. I came to this conference at the invitation of Citizen Hearing to find out more about the world and the universe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

722. When I first got the letter inviting me to participate, I did my homework and looked at the 1968 report of the Science Committee in the United States House of Representatives, read it, was real briefed on it, and thought it was a beginning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

723. Did not confirm, but had a lot of evidence that something else is among us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

724. So I thought I'd better look earlier and look more into that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

725. When my local newspaper decided to publish it, I agreed to participate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

726. It even opened wider from people I did not know and from around this country and out of the country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

727. Some cynics, but mostly scientists and intelligent people who, after years of watching the phenomenon and participating in it, came to the conclusion that there is something and that we ought to look into it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

728. So I agreed to come.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

729. When I came in on Monday, now Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and now Friday, from 9 to 5, I heard some of the most intelligent, the most scientific, the most universal knowledge on the topic that I didn't know I was going to witness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

730. So when I came in here today, and mockery is being made of it, I'm disturbed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

731. I think it's unfortunate, yesterday we heard from 12 different countries who have hundreds of years of scientific, intelligent information on this subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

732. They mentioned another 12 or 13 that weren't here yesterday but also believe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

733. It behooves us as human beings in what is known as the greatest country in the world to participate in that discussion, not just to seize or to take, but to participate and find out what it is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

734. As a grandmother of six, two sets of twins, I want them to have the kind of world that we've enjoyed all my 60 plus years, and to not act like something exists, and then further to act like it's a joke.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

735. We do a disservice to our ancestors, to God, and to the people of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

736. So I'm very new with this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

737. I served 18 years in Michigan State House and 15 years in this Congress, now here sitting with you, I'm a high school teacher, two children, six grandchildren.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

738. I want the world and the universe to continue, and if there is something out there, and I'm not a scientist, I have a master's degree from the University of Michigan, I'm learning it as you would call it, but there's a whole lot we don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

739. I think it's ignorant of any people not to seek out what we need to know to continue the universe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

740. I was convinced before this morning's panel that there probably is something out there, and I'm willing to work the rest of my life to see that it, if it is, and how we can enhance the universe to see that we all have a better quality of life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

741. As an appropriator on the House Committee here, and the first African American woman to serve on appropriations in Michigan for 18 years, and 12 of my 14 years here in Congress on the Money Committee, this federal budget is almost $4 trillion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

742. The defense budget is $700 billion of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

743. I served on that appropriations bill for many, many years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

744. Much has been said already, that's why I'm giving you this, because I want to bring it back to what I came here for.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

745. I don't want to leave it with some yellow guy with stuff sticking out of his head.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

746. It's way more serious than that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

747. I can't laugh, I haven't laughed at anything in here, because nothing's funny to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

748. I don't mean today, I mean all week.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

749. It's very serious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

750. The world is in peril.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

751. Our country is economically, socially, and economically at a disadvantage right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

752. But we fix that by being partners in what we believe is correct, and what issue you pick to work in, and not to put down historical data that's scientifically proven.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

753. You may not believe it, but don't work in that era.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

754. Don't come in here and just castigate those who do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

755. That's what's wrong with our nation, I think, and our country, and our world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

756. We don't work well enough together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

757. If someone doesn't look like we look or think like we think, we think something's wrong with them, rather than grabbing it and let's enhance what we already know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

758. Jim Coran, that's my editorial, and I think being last I could say that, because you guys have kind of disturbed me this morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

759. I think the citizens' hearing on disclosure is real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

760. I thought before today that most of you thought that too, when two or three people can come in the room and change a very intelligent subject such as this to something other than what it is, that does a disservice to our country and to our world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

761. I think Mr. Coran, if I'm pronouncing that right, Coran, you said something about proof.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

762. What is the proof?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

763. We've been sitting here for 10 hours a day and some people half the night discussing the scientific proof that's been revealed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

764. You sound very learned in the subject, but I'm not sure, do you believe in UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

765. Is there an extra SAO presence in the world?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

766. Ought we be more involved in that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

767. Well, I've still got three years left to fly, so Ted Koppel once said on his ABC news show, which I thought was a very good statement in my opinion, is who's the most wonderful and greatest extraterrestrial never seen, and that was God.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

768. It's a big universe out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

769. The proof as far as how they're getting here and their craft and that type of thing, this gets deeper than that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

770. I have run into people that probably have the proof you're talking about, but they're not going to risk their security clearance or whatever else they're risking, their families for one, to make that possible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

771. I would say the reason I've stuck in this so long and stuck my neck out so far is not just about losing a career, but it's because there are certain things that I've been privy to to keep me going, but at this point I can't get into that, and I wish I could.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

772. You know, we do, and there have been some military men who've come to this table this week and paroled to their own.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

773. There's people out there that have the proof you're looking for, but it's, you know, we're talking on a need-to-know basis, very, very high security clearances.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

774. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

775. National security is her and should be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

776. You know, I understand that, and then I was going to say the military people who came before us, and just coincidentally they were all men, but I know that there are many.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

777. I served for this room, so it seems like a different room than the other four days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

778. And I'm not trying to take anything away from the intel field or the military officers that are a bit involved with this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

779. They're doing their orders.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

780. This, from what astronaut Gordon Cooper told me, they started these lies in '47 after Roswell, and Roswell wasn't the first.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

781. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

782. Let me reclaim my time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

783. Thank you so much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

784. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

785. Just lastly for me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

786. Gordon mentioned maybe it was our UFOs, which said to me, and I think it's one of the two of you guys, gentlemen, that it might have been one of our UFOs, which to me says to me, America's UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

787. Does America are producing UFOs to confuse the cosmos or what?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

788. One of you said it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

789. I'm not sure if it was you, Major, or I think it was Major.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

790. Did you say that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

791. Or it might have been the gentleman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

792. I think I said it also is that it could be ours because they've been doing reverse engineering for 30, 40 years now, and there's no telling what they've developed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

793. I don't think anybody here is- So there might be an existence that we're creating also out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

794. And I'm not saying that's good or bad, I just want to make sure I was understanding.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

795. That's what was said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

796. That's what I'm saying.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

797. Because they say out in Area 51 they do have ships that come up from down, so yeah, we probably have them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

798. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

799. One thing, and I'm going to end on this, that came out in the scientific, intelligent discussions and testimony and lectures that we've heard this week is that whatever's out there, extraterrestrial UFOs, and I haven't yet defined the difference, I know some similarities, some differences, is way more intelligent than our technology today, can do more.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

800. The ships, the UFOs speeding up and stopping and turning and all the things that we haven't yet mastered that, that doesn't mean that we can't, or that it doesn't exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

801. It just means that we have more work to do, and we have it more to do universally.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

802. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

803. Steve Allen would like to talk to you about, now, you were a pilot, and you've done a lot of flying, but the thing you observed, the incident you observed, you were on the ground at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

804. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

805. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

806. A whole lot of people in Stephenville saw what you saw.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

807. It's obvious from your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

808. Yes, close to 200 witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

809. There were, was that what was established?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

810. I believe so, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

811. And the F-16s that you say pursued, whatever that object was, was also seen by how many people?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

812. I'm not sure of the number on that one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

813. There was several, though, quite a few.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

814. Right, okay, and do we have, is there, and I know there were newspaper reports of exactly what you said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

815. Was the radar involved in that one?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

816. Yes, radar reports show the F-16s in pursuit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

817. Well, they show the F-16s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

818. Was radar involved in the object itself, is what I'm asking, at any stage?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

819. I don't feel like it was, no, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

820. It's probably not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

821. And okay, that's consistent with what a lot of the people observed, and all, well, let's see, now, was radar, Jim, involved in either of the incidents?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

822. I think one was in '95, the others were earlier, about 10 years earlier, but was radar involved in any of those?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

823. There was no radar contact, and we had no TCAS warning, the traffic control warning system in the aircraft did not go off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

824. And I thought John Callahan had some pretty good information on why radar might not be involved.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

825. If radar is not involved, does that lead less credence to the idea that there might be an extraterrestrial origin then, if radar is involved?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

826. Well, obviously, we have stealth technology now, where that came from, I'm not going to speculate on, but I know they just had a site, it's in the news this week, Airbus Aircraft British coming into Glasgow, Scotland, December 2nd, and it just broke in the news yesterday or two days ago, and they were at 4,000 feet, and this disc-shaped thing came under them with, you know, strange lights and all that, and they never got any warning from their TCAS system or wasn't on radar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

827. So this is -- And yes, Major Filer, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

828. Richard Haynes is the -- he's the ex-NASA expert on this, and he's -- all his books and studies for years are on pilot sightings, and one of the strangest cases was this Melbourne episode in 1978 where the pilot on a Cessna 182 disappeared after he was talking on terror traffic control about this craft coming down bright light during the day, and they did have radar -- somebody got hold of the tapes from Pine Gap, Australia, our space monitoring agency down there, showing something coming at him, and then they never found any wreckage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

829. He's never been heard from again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

830. But they're -- Richard Haynes is the expert on pilot sightings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

831. Read any of his books.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

832. If you're wondering about articles from around -- since the '50s, Rob Simone did an excellent job on UFOs and the headlines, real reporting on a real phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

833. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

834. Mr. Callahan, we've been talking about radar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

835. You seem to know a lot about radar, probably the -- probably more about radar than any other expert we've heard this week.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

836. I think -- and that's not just a compliment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

837. I think it's a fact from everything I've heard, at least.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

838. The question I've asked is you gave some -- repeat, just very briefly, why you think radar does not show up in some of these sightings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

839. Well, the radar always shows up, but you can't see it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

840. That's the problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

841. Oh, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

842. You've got to remember now if a UFO or even a Russian or some other come into our air space without a working transponder, then the computer would recognize that little dot that the radar picks up as nothing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

843. And if it was a huge mass of raw radar, our system says it can't be an airplane.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

844. It must be weather.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

845. So it puts it on what they call the WIFMU, Weather Fixed Mapping Unit, and it tells the computer says I'll put it on the scope as a cloud unless the controller says I don't want to see the weather.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

846. And if that's the case, it shows up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

847. Well, I'm glad I asked you this because, at least for my benefit, this has certainly illuminated the understanding.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

848. And so it would not be fair to say if something did -- go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

849. A number of military radar operators and FAA radar operators have called me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

850. And basically, what they said was that they were told not to tell the pilots that there was a UFO out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

851. Always deny the fact the UFO exists and turn the aircraft away so there, you know, there's no chance of hitting it or whatever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

852. The point is, is that the -- I don't think there's any radar people here, but that's what I've been told.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

853. Also, they -- I understand there's some way that they program the computer so they're less likely to show the UFOs because they're usually moving at very low altitude or very high altitude at very high speeds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

854. And the tendency for the radar not to pick them up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

855. But if you go back to the raw radar data, you can get it -- And I see now -- excuse me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

856. I hate to do this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

857. I really do because I love what you're -- to give you this information, but my time has expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

858. Oh, it's too bad.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

859. I think I'm next.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

860. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

861. Oh, excuse me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

862. Go ahead, you have, in fact, four minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

863. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

864. Pilot Courant, can you -- you mentioned in your testimony that you had -- you and a group had met with a group of representatives on the Hill.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

865. Senators and -- Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

866. And this was 20 years ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

867. There were private meetings where I'd met these people on flights and we got talking and they invited me to meet them on the subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

868. They were interested.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

869. Some of them are still active.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

870. Well, so, you know, oh, it was on the airplane.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

871. It was not in their office.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

872. They invited me into their office after I met them on their flights.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

873. Okay, well, if you go in their office, you know, guess what?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

874. I know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

875. It's public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

876. They work for everybody out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

877. They don't -- but you don't have to tell who they are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

878. But they would be -- if you would let -- if they were as interested as you say, if somebody in the paradigm group or this -- the organizers here knew who they were, that might be a first step for us to get this back onto the radar of the Congress to ask for a hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

879. That's -- I mean, that would be -- you've got to find this -- we've got to find the thread.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

880. You'd think we'd know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

881. But we don't know the person that's going to be willing to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

882. But if you -- somebody has expressed interest to you or you could call them maybe directly yourself if you were -- would be willing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

883. It would be a start.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

884. I wish it was that easy, but even you folks the other day said if you were active in Congress or Senate at this time, you probably wouldn't ask for a hearing on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

885. Well, I probably would on the science committee because that would be the perfect committee for this because it's not a very -- it's not really political and -- but I mean, after this week, I would now that I've got information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

886. No, I -- on one of my flights, I asked -- it kind of went the wrong way where I asked the senator -- he was friends with some very well-to-do friends of mine, and they were main campaign fundraisers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

887. So we got talking, and it was just he and I in the -- out in the waiting area before his flight.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

888. And I asked him, "Senator, do you think there's a chance of ever having another congressional hearing like 1968 with Gerald Ford?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

889. And he said, "No, never.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

890. It's all been explained away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

891. There's no need for that."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

892. There's only one of them, but I just thought maybe you'd found somebody that had some interest.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

893. Can I -- Oh, there is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

894. They're still active, the people there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

895. I would like Mr. Callahan to be able to complete his -- you have something you wanted to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

896. And I want to make -- Well, I started -- I have a minute. -- the military is in charge of control.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

897. I started with the FAA when it was known as the CAA before radar when controlled with strips.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

898. When they brought the first radar unit into the facility, it was an old VG scope that the Navy used to use.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

899. And the instructions was 26 pages, and nobody knew how to use radar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

900. We started off with what they had was just a broadband radar, raw radar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

901. And eventually, they were able to draw airways on this VG scope that we're looking at.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

902. We had to do all kinds of things when the pilot called on the frequency, and he's approaching Harrisonburg, you look down there, and there's like 15 people all in that area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

903. So you would tell them to make a right turn, 30 degrees for 30 seconds, then resume your navigation, and you would look to see who's turning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

904. Sometimes, two or three people would turn, because sometimes the pilots have a real sense of humor.

905. And eventually, you give this guy a couple turns, and you'd pick him up and say, "He's there."

906. It's a primary target.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

907. It's only a dash.

908. We had all kinds of trouble keeping them separated from one another, because they weren't all flying under the FAA control.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

909. They invented the transponder, and they made it mandatory that you have to have a transponder to fly above certain altitudes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

910. The transponder now gives a signal so that you'll always see the target.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

911. But if there's somebody flying alongside of them that doesn't have a transponder, he shows up as a dot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

912. The dot is always there.

913. If it's a UFO, and he's traveling at 3,000, 4,000 miles an hour, when you look at your scope, you see him here, okay?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

914. Ten seconds later, he's over here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

915. He's nowhere near your area that you're controlling traffic on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

916. You get one hit, maybe two.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

917. He gets one hit on his sector, and it's gone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

918. He wouldn't know that was a UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

919. And as long as I've been in the FAA, and I had worked up to the position where I was, the guy in charge of all the air traffic people in the United States, if they screwed up on their phraseology, it was my fault.

920. That was the new thing after the strike.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

921. So I knew everything, and we did everything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

922. We never told our controllers not to report a UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

923. We did tell them not to solicit a near miss report, because when you bring two airplanes too close together, they would file what we called a near miss.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

924. Well they were getting too many near misses, so they said, "Do not ask the pilot if he wants to file a near miss.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

925. When he gets on the ground, he can do it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

926. But that's the only thing we restricted of filing, was a near miss report, not a UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

927. And I see that our time for this panel has expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

928. I want to thank the panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

929. This has been very interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

930. Thank you.
