## Speaker Group 1

205. Next, go to Mr. Jim Courant.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. I wanted to thank all the serious researchers that have been trying to get this information out for years, and thanks for you all showing up today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. And my background is I've been a pilot for, started taking lessons when I was 10 years old.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. I've been an airline captain for 31 years, flying 46 years, and have over 32,000 flight hours rated as a captain, 747s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. Most Boeing jets and Airbus, I'm also a helicopter instructor and instructor in gliders and balloons and such.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. Got interested in this subject in 1962 when I was reaching for a book on flying in a small library and a book fell out called Flying Saucer's Top Secret by Major Donald Kehoe, and he was one of the ringleaders in helping get a lot of this information out, and most of his books are credible, professional people that were, you know, people that were trained to know what they were seeing, pilots and astronomers, ground observers, such.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. And I thought it was science fiction when I first picked it up, so that's how I got started in this field, and it has not been an easy field.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. Unfortunately, after all these years, it still hasn't changed much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. I wish it had as far as military or civilian pilots of how they're treated as far as when they see something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. I'll give you an example of things that are seen but not talked about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. A friend of mine was a flight engineer, 747, with an air carrier I was flying for at the time, and they were over the Pacific, and they had a similar sighting to what happened with the Japan Airlines flight in 1986, but this was in 1980.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. There was no radar, and my friend came up to me later after his trip, and he said, "You don't believe what we saw.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. This thing was bigger than an aircraft carrier," and he said, "We were obviously flying a 747.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. They were heading to Norita.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. They were told to park the aircraft when they got there, and then they were debriefed, told never to talk about it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. There are many cases like this of pilots coming up to talk to me, because they know I've kind of stuck my neck out more than most pilots, because I've been very lucky to make some contacts with different people around the world that should know what they're talking about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. Some of them were astronauts, some cosmonauts, some generals, and I usually don't get into what I've been told, and they tell me what they know in closed-door sessions, and it's almost verbatim what I've been told before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. It's almost astounding how many people are in the know on this subject, and they're afraid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. It's not so much I find out afraid for losing their retirement, and some of them are, or their status in life, but they're more afraid for their families.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. So I'm not going to get in too much into that aspect, but what happened to me as far as I had a sighting over New Mexico, 1995, ironically, I had just finished talking to my first officer about this subject, which I had been told sometimes it wasn't a good idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. He said, "I've been flying 25 years, I've never seen anything."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. He was an ex-military tanker pilot, and his lips had barely stopped moving when the cockpit was at dusk, so it was starting to get dark.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. The cockpit started almost getting the shade of bluish green.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. I looked off to the left, and I thought the air traffic controllers had misinformed us about any traffic nearby this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. It looked a lot closer than it was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. It was oval-shaped, bluish green, moving very quickly, and they had no radar contact on this, military or civilian.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. We were just about 100 miles past Albuquerque.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. I looked to my first officer, he looked like he had just found out his wife was having an affair, and the difficult scenario with this is we got on the ground.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. Well, there were four other airliners in the area, the controller asked, "Does anybody want to report it?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. He said, "No, it's just a meteor."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. We had seen a flash of white light, and the thing took off at about a 45-degree angle back into space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. I chimed in on the radio, I said, "When does a meteor go back up?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. When we got to the ground, he didn't want to talk about it, didn't want to report it, and he never flew with me again, but this is a sad scenario because this happens so much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. Pilots come up and tell me what they've seen, many in areas over the ocean where there is no radar, and some of these fighter pilots are pretty brave guys.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. They fought in wars, and yet they're afraid of mentioning this, mostly for fear of ridicule.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. I have been invited in to talk with a small group of high-level people, a couple of senators, and Gordon Cooper, the astronaut, one of our original seven, and Edgar Mitchell are friends of mine, and I'm really proud of the effort they put out trying to get this information out because it is very hard to get to the truth on this subject, which is ridiculed so much, but it's also so hard to get to the proof, and that's what everybody's after, and I have found out why this proof is so hard to get after, and there's so much more I could share, but when you're down to just a few minutes, you have to almost be a top 40 disc jockey to get through this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. But you've got a couple more minutes, so please tell us that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. Three minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. One thing, you'd think the government doesn't take this seriously, I don't know if you've heard about this book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. I told the History Channel about it back when it first came out, it first came out in '78, but in 1992, the second edition came out and they added the section, this is the fire officer's guide to disaster control for our federal and civilian fire disaster people for atomic wars or whatever, and how to deal with it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. It's written by Navy personnel, one's an attorney, one's a PhD, and the main section that they revised in 1992 was on the UFO threat of fact, and it tells the firefighters who are usually first on the scene how to deal with the crashed UFO, possibly dead extraterrestrials or live aliens, and how to deal with the crowd situation, radiation problems, and that's that information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. So it's a very interesting addition that they added in 1992 on this book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. There are some very important books that people always ask me, because after I got involved talking about this subject to some co-pilots, I was turned in and I was evaluated for four days of flight testing, and everything went smooth, and in fact, the chief pilot said, "Well, you got through okay, you get to keep your job, and I'm very interested in this subject now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. It looks like there's more to this than I thought."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. So we used to have long talks about this, and through that situation, I was so upset about my freedom of speech rights after how I was treated as a pilot, and other pilots around the world have been treated, that I ended up getting the opportunity to do a five day a week live uncensored television show for almost three years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. And we did just a little over 500 shows on this subject, and other mysteries that I found out regarding the ... The UFO subject is basically the tip of the iceberg.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. This stuff gets very deep, and I can understand, just like Stanton Friedman has said many, many times, of the reasons why this has been kept secret, it's much more involved than people realize who don't do their homework, because most people are so busy getting their kids to school, paying their mortgage, and their own box of reality, that a person convinced against their will is of the same opinion still.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

253. And all we can do is just keep trying, and hopefully the press will have more serious articles, and the articles have been published this week, unfortunately, that put a bad frame on the seriousness of this subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. You've got about 30 seconds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. And I hope the pilots of the world that are listening will not be afraid to tell what they see, and not fear the ridicule, because this has got to end after so many years of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. But once again, I do recommend, if somebody is interested in this subject, I always recommend Richard Dolan's books, Excellent Research, Linda Moulton Howell's books, Stanton Friedman's books, Timothy Good's book called Above Top Secret, and Brad Steiger's book, The Rainbow Conspiracy, and also Michael Hesselman's book, The Secret History of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. There are many others.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

258. I have a collection of over probably 3,000 UFO books at my house, and hundreds and hundreds of videos.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. We all can't be crazy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. Thank you for your time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
