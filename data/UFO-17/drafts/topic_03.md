211. Got interested in this subject in 1962 when I was reaching for a book on flying in a small library and a book fell out called Flying Saucer's Top Secret by Major Donald Kehoe, and he was one of the ringleaders in helping get a lot of this information out, and most of his books are credible, professional people that were, you know, people that were trained to know what they were seeing, pilots and astronomers, ground observers, such.
→ {"text": "我於1962年開始對這個主題產生興趣，當時我在一間小圖書館想找一本關於飛行的書，結果一本書掉了出來，是唐納德·基霍少校所著的《飛碟最高機密》，他是協助揭露這些資訊的主要人物之一，他的書中大多是可信的專業人士，也就是受過訓練能夠辨識所見之物的人，包括飛行員、天文學家和地面觀察員等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Major Donald Kehoe 依術語表譯為唐納德·基霍少校"}

212. And I thought it was science fiction when I first picked it up, so that's how I got started in this field, and it has not been an easy field.
→ {"text": "我第一次拿起這本書時還以為是科幻小說，我就是這樣開始進入這個領域的，而這並不是一個容易的領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. Unfortunately, after all these years, it still hasn't changed much.

→ {"text": "我希望軍方或民航飛行員在目睹某些事物時所受到的對待能夠有所改變。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

215. I'll give you an example of things that are seen but not talked about.
→ {"text": "我來舉一個例子，說明那些被目睹卻不被談論的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. A friend of mine was a flight engineer, 747, with an air carrier I was flying for at the time, and they were over the Pacific, and they had a similar sighting to what happened with the Japan Airlines flight in 1986, but this was in 1980.
→ {"text": "我有一位朋友是747客機的飛航工程師，當時任職於我服務的航空公司，他們在太平洋上空時，目睹了類似1986年日本航空班機所發生的事件，但這件事發生在1980年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. There was no radar, and my friend came up to me later after his trip, and he said, "You don't believe what we saw.
→ {"text": "當時沒有雷達追蹤，我的朋友在飛行結束後來找我，他說：「你不會相信我們看到了什麼。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. They were heading to Norita.

220. They were told to park the aircraft when they got there, and then they were debriefed, told never to talk about it."
→ {"text": "「他們被告知抵達後要停放飛機，然後接受簡報，並被告知永遠不要談論這件事。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. There are many cases like this of pilots coming up to talk to me, because they know I've kind of stuck my neck out more than most pilots, because I've been very lucky to make some contacts with different people around the world that should know what they're talking about.
→ {"text": "有很多類似的案例，飛行員會來找我談論，因為他們知道我已經比大多數飛行員更敢於冒險發聲，因為我非常幸運地能夠與世界各地一些應該知道真相的人建立聯繫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. Some of them were astronauts, some cosmonauts, some generals, and I usually don't get into what I've been told, and they tell me what they know in closed-door sessions, and it's almost verbatim what I've been told before.
→ {"text": "其中有些是太空人，有些是太空人，有些是將軍，我通常不會透露他們告訴我的內容，他們在閉門會議中告訴我所知道的事情，而這與我之前被告知的內容幾乎一字不差。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. It's almost astounding how many people are in the know on this subject, and they're afraid.
→ {"text": "令人驚訝的是，有這麼多人知道這個主題的真相，而他們都感到害怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. It's not so much I find out afraid for losing their retirement, and some of them are, or their status in life, but they're more afraid for their families.
→ {"text": "我發現他們比較不是害怕失去退休金，雖然有些人確實如此，也不是害怕失去社會地位，而是更害怕他們的家人受到傷害。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. So I'm not going to get in too much into that aspect, but what happened to me as far as I had a sighting over New Mexico, 1995, ironically, I had just finished talking to my first officer about this subject, which I had been told sometimes it wasn't a good idea.
→ {"text": "所以我不會太深入那個層面，但關於我自己的經歷，我在1995年於新墨西哥州上空有一次目擊事件，諷刺的是，我剛剛才跟我的副機長談論過這個主題，而有人曾告訴我有時候這不是個好主意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. He said, "I've been flying 25 years, I've never seen anything."
→ {"text": "他說：「我已經飛了25年，從來沒有見過任何東西。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. He was an ex-military tanker pilot, and his lips had barely stopped moving when the cockpit was at dusk, so it was starting to get dark.
→ {"text": "他是退役軍中的加油機飛行員，他的話音剛落，駕駛艙正值黃昏時分，天色開始變暗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. The cockpit started almost getting the shade of bluish green.
→ {"text": "駕駛艙開始呈現出藍綠色的色調。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. I looked off to the left, and I thought the air traffic controllers had misinformed us about any traffic nearby this.
→ {"text": "我向左看去，還以為航空管制員誤報了附近是否有其他飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. It looked a lot closer than it was.
→ {"text": "它看起來比實際距離近得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. It was oval-shaped, bluish green, moving very quickly, and they had no radar contact on this, military or civilian.
→ {"text": "它是橢圓形的，藍綠色，移動非常迅速，而軍方或民間雷達都沒有追蹤到它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. We were just about 100 miles past Albuquerque.
→ {"text": "我們當時剛飛過阿布奎基約100英里。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. I looked to my first officer, he looked like he had just found out his wife was having an affair, and the difficult scenario with this is we got on the ground.
→ {"text": "我看向我的副機長，他的表情就像剛發現妻子有外遇一樣，而困難的情況是當我們降落在地面後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. Well, there were four other airliners in the area, the controller asked, "Does anybody want to report it?"
→ {"text": "當時該區域還有四架其他客機，管制員問道：「有人想要通報這件事嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. He said, "No, it's just a meteor."
→ {"text": "他說：「不用，那只是顆流星。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. We had seen a flash of white light, and the thing took off at about a 45-degree angle back into space.
→ {"text": "我們看到一道白色閃光，那東西以大約45度角的角度衝回太空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. I chimed in on the radio, I said, "When does a meteor go back up?"
→ {"text": "我在無線電中插話說：「流星什麼時候會往上升？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. When we got to the ground, he didn't want to talk about it, didn't want to report it, and he never flew with me again, but this is a sad scenario because this happens so much.
→ {"text": "當我們降落在地面後，他不想談論這件事，也不想通報，而且他再也沒有跟我一起飛行過，但這是個令人難過的情況，因為這種事經常發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. Pilots come up and tell me what they've seen, many in areas over the ocean where there is no radar, and some of these fighter pilots are pretty brave guys.
→ {"text": "飛行員會來告訴我他們所見到的事情，很多是在沒有雷達覆蓋的海洋上空區域，而這些戰鬥機飛行員中有些人是相當勇敢的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. They fought in wars, and yet they're afraid of mentioning this, mostly for fear of ridicule.
→ {"text": "他們曾在戰場上作戰，卻害怕提及這些事情，主要是害怕被嘲笑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. I have been invited in to talk with a small group of high-level people, a couple of senators, and Gordon Cooper, the astronaut, one of our original seven, and Edgar Mitchell are friends of mine, and I'm really proud of the effort they put out trying to get this information out because it is very hard to get to the truth on this subject, which is ridiculed so much, but it's also so hard to get to the proof, and that's what everybody's after, and I have found out why this proof is so hard to get after, and there's so much more I could share, but when you're down to just a few minutes, you have to almost be a top 40 disc jockey to get through this.
→ {"text": "我曾受邀與一小群高層人士談話，包括幾位參議員，而戈登·庫珀，那位太空人，我們最初的七位太空人之一，以及艾德加·米切爾博士都是我的朋友，我為他們努力揭露這些資訊感到驕傲，因為在這個經常被嘲笑的主題上要找到真相非常困難，但要找到證據也同樣困難，而這正是每個人都在追求的，我已經發現為什麼這些證據如此難以取得，而我還有更多可以分享的，但當你只剩下幾分鐘時，你幾乎得像個電台DJ一樣快速講完。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Gordon Cooper 譯為戈登·庫珀，Edgar Mitchell 譯為艾德加·米切爾博士，依術語表"}

242. But you've got a couple more minutes, so please tell us that.
→ {"text": "但你還有幾分鐘時間，所以請告訴我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. Three minutes.
→ {"text": "三分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. One thing, you'd think the government doesn't take this seriously, I don't know if you've heard about this book.
→ {"text": "有一件事，你可能會認為政府沒有認真看待這個問題，我不知道你們是否聽說過這本書。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. I told the History Channel about it back when it first came out, it first came out in '78, but in 1992, the second edition came out and they added the section, this is the fire officer's guide to disaster control for our federal and civilian fire disaster people for atomic wars or whatever, and how to deal with it.
→ {"text": "這本書首次出版時我就告訴過歷史頻道，它最初是在1978年出版的，但在1992年，第二版問世，他們增加了一個章節，這是《消防官員災難控制指南》，供我們的聯邦和民間消防人員在原子戰爭或其他災難時參考，以及如何處理相關情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Fire Officer's Guide to Disaster Control 依術語表譯為《消防官員災難控制指南》"}

246. It's written by Navy personnel, one's an attorney, one's a PhD, and the main section that they revised in 1992 was on the UFO threat of fact, and it tells the firefighters who are usually first on the scene how to deal with the crashed UFO, possibly dead extraterrestrials or live aliens, and how to deal with the crowd situation, radiation problems, and that's that information.
→ {"text": "這本書由海軍人員撰寫，一位是律師，一位是博士，他們在1992年修訂的主要章節是關於UFO威脅的事實部分，它告訴通常最先到達現場的消防員如何處理墜毀的不明飛行物、可能是死亡的外星人或活著的外星生物，以及如何處理人群狀況、輻射問題等資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. So it's a very interesting addition that they added in 1992 on this book.
→ {"text": "所以這是他們在1992年對這本書增加的一個非常有趣的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. There are some very important books that people always ask me, because after I got involved talking about this subject to some co-pilots, I was turned in and I was evaluated for four days of flight testing, and everything went smooth, and in fact, the chief pilot said, "Well, you got through okay, you get to keep your job, and I'm very interested in this subject now.
→ {"text": "有一些非常重要的書籍是人們經常問我的，因為在我開始跟一些副機長談論這個主題後，我被檢舉了，並接受了為期四天的飛行測試評估，而一切都很順利，事實上，主任飛行員說：「嗯，你通過了，你可以保住你的工作，而我現在對這個主題非常感興趣。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. It looks like there's more to this than I thought."
→ {"text": "「看起來這比我想像的還要複雜。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. So we used to have long talks about this, and through that situation, I was so upset about my freedom of speech rights after how I was treated as a pilot, and other pilots around the world have been treated, that I ended up getting the opportunity to do a five day a week live uncensored television show for almost three years.
→ {"text": "所以我們以前經常長談這個話題，通過那個情況，我對自己作為飛行員所受到的待遇，以及世界各地其他飛行員所受到的待遇，感到言論自由權利受到侵犯，非常沮喪，結果我得到了一個機會，做了一個每週五天直播、未經審查的電視節目，持續了將近三年。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": ""}

251. And we did just a little over 500 shows on this subject, and other mysteries that I found out regarding the ... The UFO subject is basically the tip of the iceberg.
→ {"text": "我們做了超過500集關於這個主題的節目，以及我所發現的其他神秘事件……UFO主題基本上只是冰山一角。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. This stuff gets very deep, and I can understand, just like Stanton Friedman has said many, many times, of the reasons why this has been kept secret, it's much more involved than people realize who don't do their homework, because most people are so busy getting their kids to school, paying their mortgage, and their own box of reality, that a person convinced against their will is of the same opinion still.
→ {"text": "這些事情非常深奧，我可以理解，就像史丹頓·弗里德曼多次說過的，為什麼這件事被保密的原因，這比那些沒有做功課的人所意識到的要複雜得多，因為大多數人都忙著送孩子上學、繳房貸，以及維持自己的現實認知，所以一個違背自己意願被說服的人，仍然會保持原來的觀點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Stanton Friedman 依術語表譯為史丹頓·弗里德曼"}

253. And all we can do is just keep trying, and hopefully the press will have more serious articles, and the articles have been published this week, unfortunately, that put a bad frame on the seriousness of this subject.
→ {"text": "我們所能做的就是繼續努力，希望媒體會有更多認真的報導，但不幸的是，本週發表的一些文章卻給這個嚴肅的主題帶來了負面的框架。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. You've got about 30 seconds.
→ {"text": "你還有大约30秒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. And I hope the pilots of the world that are listening will not be afraid to tell what they see, and not fear the ridicule, because this has got to end after so many years of this.
→ {"text": "我希望正在聆聽的世界各地的飛行員不要害怕說出他們所見到的事情，不要害怕被嘲笑，因為這麼多年來的這種情況必須結束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. But once again, I do recommend, if somebody is interested in this subject, I always recommend Richard Dolan's books, Excellent Research, Linda Moulton Howell's books, Stanton Friedman's books, Timothy Good's book called Above Top Secret, and Brad Steiger's book, The Rainbow Conspiracy, and also Michael Hesselman's book, The Secret History of UFOs.
→ {"text": "但再次強調，如果有人對這個主題感興趣，我總是推薦理查德·多蘭的著作，研究非常出色，琳達·莫爾頓·豪的著作，史丹頓·弗里德曼的著作，提摩西·古德的《Above Top Secret》，以及布拉德·斯泰格的《The Rainbow Conspiracy》，還有麥可·赫塞曼的《The Secret History of UFOs》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "依術語表：Richard Dolan 譯為理查德·多蘭，Linda Moulton Howe 譯為琳達·莫爾頓·豪，Stanton Friedman 譯為史丹頓·弗里德曼，Timothy Good 譯為提摩西·古德，Brad Steiger 譯為布拉德·斯泰格，Michael Hesselman 譯為麥可·赫塞曼"}

257. There are many others.
→ {"text": "還有很多其他的書籍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. I have a collection of over probably 3,000 UFO books at my house, and hundreds and hundreds of videos.
→ {"text": "我家裡收藏了超過大概3，000本UFO相關書籍，以及數百部影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. We all can't be crazy.
→ {"text": "我們不可能都是瘋子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. Thank you for your time.
→ {"text": "謝謝各位的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
