## Speaker Group 1

394. Hopefully you will be able to help us. [applause] Okay, well, thank you very much, witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. We will have ten minutes for questioning from each member of the panel, and if any would like to reserve some of their time on the first round, we will hopefully get two rounds in, if that is possible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. Mr. Callahan would like to start and ask you a little more context on that meeting in the FAA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. Where was it and what was the year you mentioned the Reagan administration?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. I would just like to put this, your testimony, a little more context so I understand it just a little bit better.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. Well, at FAA headquarters, 800 Independence, the administrator is on the 10th floor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. On the 10th floor, he has what we call a round room, similar to what the President has.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. He had set up a meeting for us to go in that room, and also had a big TV screen that comes out of the wall, similar to what you have up here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. The people that were there were the three scientists, the three CIA guys, a bunch of grunts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. I brought up 22 experts from the area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. They watched the video, and I have got the original copy of the video here, in case you guys are ever interested.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. I have got the voice tapes from the military.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. There were probably, what, about 30 to 40 people in attendance at that briefing?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. Yeah, that is pretty close, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. Let me ask you this question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. When was the first time, that happened, which year, '88, '86, if you can remember.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. And approximations are just fine here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. When was the first time you were able to, or that you felt comfortable, or in fact under any sort of sense, talk about this openly to let people know what you witnessed at that briefing?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. Well, I do not have any problems being comfortable any time I am talking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. So you did it immediately, I take it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. My wife is one of those engineers, software engineers, and after I spoke to the administrator on the way home, I told her what we had seen up at Atlantic City.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. I played the tape at home, and she is one of those guys, if you asked her what time it was, she would tell you how to build a watch first.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. Well, she is watching the TV screen at home, and she is telling me what we are looking at and how that target got there and got there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. So besides your wife, who else did you tell about this event?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. And let me just preface that with, were you asked by anybody, the CIA, the three CIA gentlemen, not to talk about the briefing, or?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. Well, they made a comment, but they were talking to the people I brought up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. So in other words, you, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. As far as I was concerned, they were not talking to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. And, you know, okay, I appreciate that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. I would like to just ask Jim Courant to follow up a few questions on what you testified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. Let's see, the sighting you had was in 1995, I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. Did you have any other sightings in your, was it 40 years experience as an airline pilot that you mentioned, or 30 to 40 years?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. Flying as an airline pilot since 1971.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. So over 40 years experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. Any other sightings?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. There were, it was unusual, but at two different locations, a week apart in the middle of the night.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. And both times I had two different co-pilots, and they were ironically both ex-tanker pilots, so they knew what a tanker operation looks like at night.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. And we were, you know, probably around 35,000 feet, 32,000, the other incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. One was over Montana, one over Georgia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. Two in the morning, the first one a little past 3.30 in the morning, the other one, both times no radar contact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. They were ironically very similar, I'd never heard of these type of shapes before as far as that high up, but in my research.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. But they were like glowing orbs, three of them in formation, and they were just hovering.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. And we're cruising along about 450 miles an hour, and like I said before, I'm a helicopter instructor, so obviously a helicopter can't hover that high.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. But I must say, with all this, most of what people are seeing are aerial phenomena, maybe black projects from our government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. So a very small percentage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. Do you think it might be able to be explained?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. It could be something, of course this was back in 19, would have been 1985, or actually was around '85, '86, but we didn't have these drones like we have now, but I don't even think they fly that high.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. But these things were just hovering there, stationary, and then they just slowly turned to the left and started flying off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. And both times when we asked the controllers, "Do you have anything on the radar?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. And they said, "We show no traffic in your ART CAS," which is our traffic avoidance system never went off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. And I'm going to get back to this radar question, but I'd like to reserve the balance of my time to ask questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. So I'd like to call on Representative Woolsey to take this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. Major Feiler.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. This is just out of the blue question, but I'd like to hear your perspective on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. And if any of the rest of you have ideas about this, two questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. One, could a UFO like a drone be controlled from the ground electronically, or two?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. Could UFO materials be developed here in the United States or on earth and tested against our military?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. I think it's possible, both are true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. Ben Rich at Lockheed indicated that, in so many words, we had back-engineered some of these craft and we're now able to take ET home.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. The point is, is that apparently we're able to do a lot of things now, and probably some of what we're seeing is our own UFO, so to speak.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. Okay, now, but do you think we're learning from the UFOs and then we're building because of, I mean, or are we, was that us in the first place?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. Well, in a sense, I think anything's possible, but I also believe that we're being visited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. Anybody else have a thought on that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. I mean, you know, maybe we're way more clever than any of us realize, and my question would be, and it's just a push back on making sure we've covered all ground, are we setting, are Earthlings setting this up in the first place, you know, so that we find our way to outer space and for what could come with wars in outer space, but, or are the non-Earthlings coming to us and showing us what they know, and we're realizing we've got to compete?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. That's a good question, what you asked, because I never heard that before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. The people I talk to that have been involved in the reverse engineering, they call it, with the UFOs that they captured, they could, by now, because it's been, what, 30 years or more, they could have developed a ship that they could be out practicing with or a group of ships.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. If you remember Dr. Mitchell, when he spoke, he said when he was en route to the moon, he looked out the left portal, I would call it a window, and he called down to NASA and said I'm now a fighter too, he thought that that spaceship flying along with them was made here in the United States and they were flight checking it, so it is possible that the United States has been making these UFOs, but I don't think they're going to tell us, and it's just one of those, how do you really know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. Okay, anybody else, yes, Mr. Allen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. Two points, why would our jets be chasing it and why would they let it out over a very densely populated area, if it was ours?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. Good questions, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. Well, don't ask me, I'm asking you, I mean, why?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. Because possibly we want to find out if our military can keep up with what we've learned is out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. Could be a test.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. You'd think they'd test it out in the desert somewhere where there's no observers and media attention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. But most of it has been over open space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. The individual that gave me most of my flying lessons when I was younger was a Triple H in World War II, two books were written about him, one by a general from the Air Force Academy, his name was Colonel Leroy Gover, and he was one of the first 100 American pilots in World War II, he went over to Canada and then became commander of Eagle Squadron.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. I knew him for 40 years, he was a pilot's pilot, and on his deathbed, three weeks before he passed on, I gave him a copy of Colonel Corso's book, The Day After Roswell, and he said I don't know a whole lot about certain aspects of this book, if it's all true, but I can tell you from what I was involved with, the people I knew, because he was with the Army Air Corps which later the same year as the alleged incident in Roswell happened, the Air Force was formed along with the United Nations and other developments, but he confirmed that in his words, and I never heard this man lie, he said they were androgynous, they didn't know their full technological capabilities at that time, at least one of them survived, they didn't know their full psychological makeup, or where they were from, or what this was all about, this was at this time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. So that's just one other deathbed statement, he was a good friend, and so was Gordon Cooper who basically made similar statements the years that I knew him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. So I'm going to ask a very short question of you, Jim, because it's appropriate at this point, and then I'm going to waive the rest of my time until later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. Has your credibility been questioned because you were a believer before you were part of a sighting?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. People say oh yeah, well he wanted that to happen, so he made it happen in his mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. Amazingly enough, that hasn't come up in discussion, but it's definitely something that I expected, but that hasn't been a problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. Okay, good, thank you very much, and I'll yield for the time being.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. Could we go to Representative Bartlett, please?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
