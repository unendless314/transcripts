## Speaker Group 1

394. Hopefully you will be able to help us. [applause] Okay, well, thank you very much, witnesses.
→ {"text": "希望各位能夠幫助我們。［掌聲］好的，非常感謝各位證人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. We will have ten minutes for questioning from each member of the panel, and if any would like to reserve some of their time on the first round, we will hopefully get two rounds in, if that is possible.
→ {"text": "每位委員將有十分鐘的質詢時間，如果有人希望在第一輪保留部分時間，我們希望能進行兩輪質詢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. Mr. Callahan would like to start and ask you a little more context on that meeting in the FAA.
→ {"text": "卡拉漢先生，我想先從您開始，請問您能否提供更多關於 FAA 那次會議的背景資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. Where was it and what was the year you mentioned the Reagan administration?
→ {"text": "會議地點在哪裡？您提到雷根政府，那是哪一年的事情？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. I would just like to put this, your testimony, a little more context so I understand it just a little bit better.
→ {"text": "我只是想為您的證詞提供更多背景脈絡，讓我能更好地理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. Well, at FAA headquarters, 800 Independence, the administrator is on the 10th floor.
→ {"text": "嗯，在 FAA 總部，獨立大道 800 號，局長辦公室在 10 樓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. On the 10th floor, he has what we call a round room, similar to what the President has.
→ {"text": "在 10 樓，他有一間我們稱之為圓形會議室的房間，類似總統用的那種。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. He had set up a meeting for us to go in that room, and also had a big TV screen that comes out of the wall, similar to what you have up here.
→ {"text": "他安排我們在那間會議室開會，還有一個從牆壁伸出來的大電視螢幕，類似你們這裡的設備。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. The people that were there were the three scientists, the three CIA guys, a bunch of grunts.
→ {"text": "在場的有三位科學家、三位 CIA 人員，還有一些基層人員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. I brought up 22 experts from the area.
→ {"text": "我從該地區帶來了 22 位專家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. They watched the video, and I have got the original copy of the video here, in case you guys are ever interested.
→ {"text": "他們觀看了錄影帶，我這裡有錄影帶的原始拷貝，如果你們有興趣的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. I have got the voice tapes from the military.
→ {"text": "我還有來自軍方的語音錄音帶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. There were probably, what, about 30 to 40 people in attendance at that briefing?
→ {"text": "那場簡報會大概有多少人出席，30 到 40 人左右嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. Yeah, that is pretty close, yeah.
→ {"text": "是的，差不多就是那個數字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. Let me ask you this question.
→ {"text": "讓我問您這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. When was the first time, that happened, which year, '88, '86, if you can remember.
→ {"text": "那是第一次發生這種事是在哪一年，88 年還是 86 年，如果您記得的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. And approximations are just fine here.
→ {"text": "大約的時間就可以了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. When was the first time you were able to, or that you felt comfortable, or in fact under any sort of sense, talk about this openly to let people know what you witnessed at that briefing?
→ {"text": "您第一次能夠、或者感到自在、或者說在任何意義上，公開談論這件事並讓人們知道您在簡報會上目睹了什麼，是什麼時候？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. Well, I do not have any problems being comfortable any time I am talking.
→ {"text": "嗯，我說話的時候從來不會感到不自在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. So you did it immediately, I take it.
→ {"text": "所以我想您立刻就說出去了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. My wife is one of those engineers, software engineers, and after I spoke to the administrator on the way home, I told her what we had seen up at Atlantic City.
→ {"text": "我太太是軟體工程師之一，在我與局長談話後回家的路上，我就告訴她我們在大西洋城看到了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. I played the tape at home, and she is one of those guys, if you asked her what time it was, she would tell you how to build a watch first.
→ {"text": "我在家播放了錄音帶，她是那種如果你問她現在幾點，她會先告訴你怎麼做手錶的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. Well, she is watching the TV screen at home, and she is telling me what we are looking at and how that target got there and got there.
→ {"text": "嗯，她在家裡看著電視螢幕，告訴我們看到的是什麼，以及那個目標是如何移動到那裡的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. So besides your wife, who else did you tell about this event?
→ {"text": "所以除了您太太之外，您還告訴了誰這件事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. And let me just preface that with, were you asked by anybody, the CIA, the three CIA gentlemen, not to talk about the briefing, or?
→ {"text": "讓我先問一下，有沒有人要求您，CIA 那三位先生，要求您不要談論這場簡報會，還是？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. Well, they made a comment, but they were talking to the people I brought up.
→ {"text": "嗯，他們有發表評論，但他們是在對我帶來的人說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. So in other words, you, okay.
→ {"text": "換句話說，您，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. As far as I was concerned, they were not talking to me.
→ {"text": "就我而言，他們不是在對我說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. I understand.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. And, you know, okay, I appreciate that.
→ {"text": "好的，我明白了，感謝您的說明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. I would like to just ask Jim Courant to follow up a few questions on what you testified.
→ {"text": "我想請吉姆·庫蘭特針對您的證詞追問幾個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. Let's see, the sighting you had was in 1995, I understand.
→ {"text": "讓我想想，您的目擊事件發生在 1995 年，我了解得沒錯吧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. Did you have any other sightings in your, was it 40 years experience as an airline pilot that you mentioned, or 30 to 40 years?
→ {"text": "在您擔任航線機長的經歷中，您提到是 40 年還是 30 到 40 年的經驗，還有其他目擊事件嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. Flying as an airline pilot since 1971.
→ {"text": "從 1971 年開始擔任航線機長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. So over 40 years experience.
→ {"text": "所以是超過 40 年的經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. Any other sightings?
→ {"text": "還有其他目擊事件嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. Yeah.
→ {"text": "有的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. There were, it was unusual, but at two different locations, a week apart in the middle of the night.
→ {"text": "有，這很不尋常，發生在兩個不同的地點，相隔一週，都在半夜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. And both times I had two different co-pilots, and they were ironically both ex-tanker pilots, so they knew what a tanker operation looks like at night.
→ {"text": "而且兩次都是不同的副機長，諷刺的是兩位都是前加油機飛行員，所以他們知道加油機在夜間作業是什麼樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. And we were, you know, probably around 35,000 feet, 32,000, the other incident.
→ {"text": "我們當時大概在 35,000 英呎左右，另一次事件是在 32,000 英呎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. One was over Montana, one over Georgia.
→ {"text": "一次在蒙大拿州上空，一次在喬治亞州上空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. Two in the morning, the first one a little past 3.30 in the morning, the other one, both times no radar contact.
→ {"text": "凌晨兩點，第一次是凌晨三點半過後，另一次也是，兩次都沒有雷達接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. They were ironically very similar, I'd never heard of these type of shapes before as far as that high up, but in my research.
→ {"text": "諷刺的是它們非常相似，我以前從未聽說過在那麼高的地方有這種形狀的物體，但根據我的研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. But they were like glowing orbs, three of them in formation, and they were just hovering.
→ {"text": "但它們像是發光的球體，三個排成編隊，就懸停在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. And we're cruising along about 450 miles an hour, and like I said before, I'm a helicopter instructor, so obviously a helicopter can't hover that high.
→ {"text": "我們以每小時約 450 英里的速度巡航，就像我之前說的，我是直升機教練，所以顯然直升機無法在那麼高的地方懸停。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. But I must say, with all this, most of what people are seeing are aerial phenomena, maybe black projects from our government.
→ {"text": "但我必須說，儘管如此，人們看到的大部分都是空中現象，也許是我們政府的黑幕計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. So a very small percentage.
→ {"text": "所以只有很小一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. Do you think it might be able to be explained?
→ {"text": "您認為這有可能被解釋嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. It could be something, of course this was back in 19, would have been 1985, or actually was around '85, '86, but we didn't have these drones like we have now, but I don't even think they fly that high.
→ {"text": "有可能是某種東西，當然這是早在 1985 年，或者實際上是 85、86 年左右，但我們當時沒有像現在這樣的無人機，而且我甚至不認為無人機能飛到那麼高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. But these things were just hovering there, stationary, and then they just slowly turned to the left and started flying off.
→ {"text": "但這些東西就懸停在那裡，靜止不動，然後慢慢向左轉並開始飛走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. And both times when we asked the controllers, "Do you have anything on the radar?"
→ {"text": "兩次我們都問航管員：『雷達上有顯示任何東西嗎？』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. And they said, "We show no traffic in your ART CAS," which is our traffic avoidance system never went off.
→ {"text": "他們說：『我們在您的航空防撞系統上沒有顯示任何飛行物。』也就是說我們的空中防撞系統從未啟動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. And I'm going to get back to this radar question, but I'd like to reserve the balance of my time to ask questions.
→ {"text": "我稍後會回到雷達的問題，但我想保留剩餘時間來提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. So I'd like to call on Representative Woolsey to take this.
→ {"text": "所以我想請伍爾西代表接手。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
→ {"text": "謝謝主席先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. Major Feiler.
→ {"text": "費勒少校。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. This is just out of the blue question, but I'd like to hear your perspective on it.
→ {"text": "這是個突然的問題，但我想聽聽您的看法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. And if any of the rest of you have ideas about this, two questions.
→ {"text": "如果其他人對此有任何想法也可以，有兩個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. One, could a UFO like a drone be controlled from the ground electronically, or two?
→ {"text": "第一，不明飛行物是否可能像無人機一樣從地面電子控制？第二，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. Could UFO materials be developed here in the United States or on earth and tested against our military?
→ {"text": "不明飛行物的材料是否可能在美國或地球上開發，並用來對抗我們的軍隊進行測試？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. I think it's possible, both are true.
→ {"text": "我認為這是可能的，兩者都有可能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. Ben Rich at Lockheed indicated that, in so many words, we had back-engineered some of these craft and we're now able to take ET home.
→ {"text": "洛克希德公司的班·里奇曾表示，換句話說，我們已經對其中一些飛行器進行了逆向工程，現在我們能夠帶 ET 回家了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. The point is, is that apparently we're able to do a lot of things now, and probably some of what we're seeing is our own UFO, so to speak.
→ {"text": "重點是，顯然我們現在能夠做很多事情，而且可能我們看到的一些東西，可以說，是我們自己的不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. Okay, now, but do you think we're learning from the UFOs and then we're building because of, I mean, or are we, was that us in the first place?
→ {"text": "好的，但您認為我們是從不明飛行物中學習然後建造它們，還是說，一開始就是我們自己造的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. Well, in a sense, I think anything's possible, but I also believe that we're being visited.
→ {"text": "嗯，在某種意義上，我認為一切皆有可能，但我也相信我們正在被造訪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. Anybody else have a thought on that?
→ {"text": "其他人對此有什麼想法嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. I mean, you know, maybe we're way more clever than any of us realize, and my question would be, and it's just a push back on making sure we've covered all ground, are we setting, are Earthlings setting this up in the first place, you know, so that we find our way to outer space and for what could come with wars in outer space, but, or are the non-Earthlings coming to us and showing us what they know, and we're realizing we've got to compete?
→ {"text": "我是說，也許我們比任何人意識到的都更聰明，我的問題是，這只是為了確保我們涵蓋所有面向的反駁，是我們地球人一開始就在策劃這一切，為了讓我們找到通往外太空的道路，以及為了可能發生的外太空戰爭做準備？還是非地球生物來找我們，向我們展示他們所知道的，而我們意識到我們必須競爭？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. That's a good question, what you asked, because I never heard that before.
→ {"text": "您問了個好問題，因為我從未聽過這種說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. The people I talk to that have been involved in the reverse engineering, they call it, with the UFOs that they captured, they could, by now, because it's been, what, 30 years or more, they could have developed a ship that they could be out practicing with or a group of ships.
→ {"text": "我交談過的那些參與逆向工程的人，他們這樣稱呼，用他們捕獲的不明飛行物，到現在，因為已經過了 30 多年，他們可能已經開發出一艘或一組可以用來演練的飛船。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. If you remember Dr. Mitchell, when he spoke, he said when he was en route to the moon, he looked out the left portal, I would call it a window, and he called down to NASA and said I'm now a fighter too, he thought that that spaceship flying along with them was made here in the United States and they were flight checking it, so it is possible that the United States has been making these UFOs, but I don't think they're going to tell us, and it's just one of those, how do you really know?
→ {"text": "如果您記得米切爾博士發言時說過，當他在前往月球的途中，他從左邊的窗口望出去，我會稱之為窗戶，他打電話給 NASA 說我現在也是戰鬥機飛行員了，他以為那艘與他們一起飛行的太空船是在美國製造的，他們正在進行飛行測試，所以美國有可能一直在製造這些不明飛行物，但我不認為他們會告訴我們，這就是問題所在，你怎麼能確定呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. Okay, anybody else, yes, Mr. Allen.
→ {"text": "好的，還有其他人嗎，是的，艾倫先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. Two points, why would our jets be chasing it and why would they let it out over a very densely populated area, if it was ours?
→ {"text": "有兩點，如果那是我們的東西，為什麼我們的噴射機要追逐它，為什麼要讓它出現在人口稠密的地區？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. Good questions, yes.
→ {"text": "好問題，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. Well, don't ask me, I'm asking you, I mean, why?
→ {"text": "嗯，別問我，我是在問您，我是說，為什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. Because possibly we want to find out if our military can keep up with what we've learned is out there.
→ {"text": "因為我們可能想知道我們的軍隊是否能跟上我們所發現的外界科技。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. Could be a test.
→ {"text": "可能是個測試。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. You'd think they'd test it out in the desert somewhere where there's no observers and media attention.
→ {"text": "您會認為他們應該在沙漠某處測試，那裡沒有觀察者和媒體關注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

474. But most of it has been over open space.
→ {"text": "但大部分都發生在開闊空域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. The individual that gave me most of my flying lessons when I was younger was a Triple H in World War II, two books were written about him, one by a general from the Air Force Academy, his name was Colonel Leroy Gover, and he was one of the first 100 American pilots in World War II, he went over to Canada and then became commander of Eagle Squadron.
→ {"text": "我年輕時教我飛行的人是一位二戰時期的王牌飛行員，有兩本書是關於他的，其中一本是空軍軍官學校的一位將軍寫的，他的名字是萊羅伊·高佛上校，他是二戰時期第一批 100 位美國飛行員之一，他去了加拿大，然後成為鷹中隊的指揮官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. I knew him for 40 years, he was a pilot's pilot, and on his deathbed, three weeks before he passed on, I gave him a copy of Colonel Corso's book, The Day After Roswell, and he said I don't know a whole lot about certain aspects of this book, if it's all true, but I can tell you from what I was involved with, the people I knew, because he was with the Army Air Corps which later the same year as the alleged incident in Roswell happened, the Air Force was formed along with the United Nations and other developments, but he confirmed that in his words, and I never heard this man lie, he said they were androgynous, they didn't know their full technological capabilities at that time, at least one of them survived, they didn't know their full psychological makeup, or where they were from, or what this was all about, this was at this time.
→ {"text": "我認識他 40 年，他是飛行員中的飛行員，在他臨終前三週，我給了他一本科索上校的書《羅斯威爾事件後的一天》，他說我對這本書的某些方面不太了解，不知道是否全部屬實，但我可以告訴你根據我參與的事情、我認識的人，因為他在陸軍航空隊服役，後來就在所謂的羅斯威爾事件發生的同一年，空軍成立了，還有聯合國和其他發展，但他用他自己的話證實了，我從未聽過這個人說謊，他說他們是雌雄同體的，當時他們不知道這些生物的完整科技能力，至少有一個倖存下來，他們不知道這些生物的完整心理特徵，或者他們來自哪裡，或者這一切是怎麼回事，這是當時的情況。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "androgynous 在此語境可能指外星人沒有明顯性別特徵，譯為「雌雄同體的」"}

477. So that's just one other deathbed statement, he was a good friend, and so was Gordon Cooper who basically made similar statements the years that I knew him.
→ {"text": "所以這只是另一個臨終證詞，他是一位好朋友，戈登·庫珀也是，在我認識他的那些年裡，他基本上也說過類似的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

478. So I'm going to ask a very short question of you, Jim, because it's appropriate at this point, and then I'm going to waive the rest of my time until later.
→ {"text": "所以我要問你一個簡短的問題，吉姆，因為在這個時候問很合適，然後我會放棄剩餘的時間，稍後再說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

479. Has your credibility been questioned because you were a believer before you were part of a sighting?
→ {"text": "您的可信度是否因為在目擊事件之前就已經是相信者而受到質疑？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

480. People say oh yeah, well he wanted that to happen, so he made it happen in his mind.
→ {"text": "人們會說，哦是啊，他希望那件事發生，所以他在腦海中讓它發生了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

481. Amazingly enough, that hasn't come up in discussion, but it's definitely something that I expected, but that hasn't been a problem.
→ {"text": "令人驚訝的是，這在討論中從未被提出，但這確實是我預料之中的事情，不過這並沒有造成問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

482. Okay, good, thank you very much, and I'll yield for the time being.
→ {"text": "好的，很好，非常感謝，我暫時讓出發言權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

483. Could we go to Representative Bartlett, please?
→ {"text": "我們可以請巴特利特代表發言嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
