On the evening of January the 8th, 2008, at 6.15 p.m. in Selden, Texas, just outside of Stephenville at my friend's home, Mike Odom, I witnessed a set of four very bright high intensity lights flying extremely fast in a very low altitude, what seemed to be coming directly at us, flying from east to west.
