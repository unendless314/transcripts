## Speaker Group 8

74. Thank you for your statement, Mr. Sheehan. We'll now begin the questioning of our witnesses and we're going to change the order. We're going to start with Dr. Bookman and we're just going to work our way down this way.

75. Mr. Dolan, we've had this conversation before and I think it might be helpful to the committee too. How many crashes do you find credible, roughly?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. I've never bothered to tally them up. There are a couple of very good book studies that have been done, one by a gentleman who's here, Dr. Kevin Randle, another by Ryan Wood.

77. How many do your colleagues generally, as you look at their materials, have you concluded?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. I don't think 10 would be outrageous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. Maybe 10 craft have been recovered, 10 crashes. Let's talk about those 10. We assume that we're not the most enlightened, caring, loving folk in the galaxy, I gather. Is there any evidence that the colleagues of these crashed extraterrestrials have come looking for them or attempted to recover their crash technology or their brothers and sisters who might have been held in captivity, no matter how comfortable here?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. All we're dealing with are leaks and more leaks and stories and claims. It would not be illogical. There have been claims that have been made proving these, getting corroboration is another story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. Yes, Representative Woolsey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. Thank you. I think we should shorten this as best we can, except for the Honorable Paul Heller. One thing I'd like to say to Paul Heller is, I think we know the answer about who knows about this, when you two guys brought it up. I think Mr. Heller answered it for us. It's the three sisters. I mean, they know of the industrial complexes, the oil cabal, the banking cabal. They know. They've been controlling this for a long time. We know they know, and we know they've been controlling it, so our question is now, what do we do about it? I don't think it does a lot of good to go out and insult the people that are going to have to do something about it, but we can do more than we're doing. We have to get money out of politics, one. I don't mean control the press, what they can see. We have to expand the press so that three or five corporations don't own the communications in our country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. We have to do something about our education system so that our students graduate knowing how to question, staying in school in the first place, but they have to learn how to question. They have to learn how to analyze. They have to make decisions that are in their own best interests, not in the best interests of the top 1% of the wealthiest people in this country. We have to have economic justice. I mean, there's so much that we have to do in this country. If we had a country that was not based on money and had a press that would speak truth to power and uneducated public, we'd be demanding and wanting to hear everything that I heard this week from all of you. It isn't there, it isn't happening, and we just do, I mean, we have so much work to do. I mean, and then the question of, well, my question is, what would it look like, why would it be upsetting to get this information
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. out? What does upsetting information look like?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. Well, Ms. Woolsey, if I might have something to say on that. I had a conversation with a gentleman who I will just say is of absolutely impeccable credentials who told me of his personal knowledge of a briefing that was given to President Jimmy Carter back in June of 1977 on exactly this matter. Now, he doesn't know the details of what was said, but he does know that it was a briefing about the extraterrestrial presence. This was in June of 1977, the beginning of his first year. And at the end of that meeting, the President was seen with his head in his hands, elbows on the desk, and weeping or deeply upset.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. Something was told to him that was very upsetting. I asked this individual if he had any idea what it was. He did not bother to speculate. But I will say that I have another gentleman who was a senior cabinet member in the first Reagan administration, who similarly told of being taken for several weeks after he got his job to an underground facility to receive a briefing and was deeply upset because, as he said to a trusted family member, I have a daughter and I am terrified for her. So there is something going on in which this phenomenon is either threatening or we might speculate beyond the control of the political powers that are officially representing us. Well, it is beyond control. It is the three sisters that are running it. So thank you. Thank you. And let's go to a representative from Maryland. Thank you very much. I want to, for a few

88. moments dwell a bit on a problem that was mentioned by both Mr. Hellyer and Dr. Bookman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. That is the constitutional issue here. For the moment, we are the undisputed economic and military superpower in the world. We are a bit less than 5% of the world's population.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. We are about one person out of 22 in the world. And we have just about, we represent about a fourth of the world's economy, which means we have about a fourth of all the good things in the world. How come? How come? We no longer have the best work ethic in the world. All you have to do is drive around and watch for people bending their back and sweating and working. You won't see very many white faces. You don't see very many black faces. You see Hispanic faces. We no longer have the most respect for the nuclear family. This year, almost half our babies will be born out of wedlock. We no longer have the most respect for technical education. This year, the Chinese will graduate seven times as many engineering students as we graduate. How is it then that we are so darn fortunate that we are the undisputed economic and military superpower in the world? I think it's because of our enormous respect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. And we have a fourth of all the good things in the world. I think it's our enormous respect for civil liberties. There's no other constitution. There's no other bill of rights to protect civil liberties like ours. And I think, by the way, you've mentioned it, gentlemen. We are not a democracy. We are a democratic process. But we are a republic, Benjamin Franklin asked.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. There's a fundamental difference there. There's a fundamental difference there. I'm very concerned that because our government today so easily ignores the constitution to do what they think are good things, that tomorrow, like some of the functions of our government that I think are extra constitutional, if not unconstitutional, like ignoring the First Amendment requirement that the citizens have a right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. And there's a grievance that there's not been a hearing on this for a very long time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. If the government can ignore the constitution to be good things today, tomorrow they can ignore the constitution to do bad things. Other countries have done it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. When my ex-chief of staff, who is now my colleague, called me and asked me if I was interested in this and warned me that there was a big probability that a lot of people would relegate me to the lunatic fringe for coming here. I told her that the primary reason that I would come was that there's a serious constitutional issue here. The citizens have a right for their government to tell them what's going on here. And I want to thank both of you for bringing up this constitutional issue because I think it is a very serious one. A government which ignores the constitution to do good things today, what they think are good things today, can ignore the constitution to do bad things tomorrow because it will rationalize that they are good things tomorrow. So thank you very much for your shared concern of this issue.
