## Speaker Group 8

74. Thank you for your statement, Mr. Sheehan. We'll now begin the questioning of our witnesses and we're going to change the order. We're going to start with Dr. Bookman and we're just going to work our way down this way.
→ {"text": "希恩先生，感謝您的陳述。我們現在開始向證人提問，並將改變順序。我們將從布克曼醫師開始，然後依序進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. Mr. Dolan, we've had this conversation before and I think it might be helpful to the committee too. How many crashes do you find credible, roughly?
→ {"text": "多蘭先生，我們之前談過這個問題，我想這對委員會也有幫助。您認為大約有多少起墜毀事件是可信的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. I've never bothered to tally them up. There are a couple of very good book studies that have been done, one by a gentleman who's here, Dr. Kevin Randle, another by Ryan Wood.
→ {"text": "我從未費心去統計。有幾本非常好的研究著作，一本是由在座的一位先生撰寫的，凱文·蘭德爾博士，另一本是由瑞安·伍德撰寫的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. How many do your colleagues generally, as you look at their materials, have you concluded?
→ {"text": "根據您閱讀同僚的資料，他們一般認為有多少起？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. I don't think 10 would be outrageous.
→ {"text": "我認為十起並不算誇張。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. Maybe 10 craft have been recovered, 10 crashes. Let's talk about those 10. We assume that we're not the most enlightened, caring, loving folk in the galaxy, I gather. Is there any evidence that the colleagues of these crashed extraterrestrials have come looking for them or attempted to recover their crash technology or their brothers and sisters who might have been held in captivity, no matter how comfortable here?
→ {"text": "也許有十架飛行器被回收，十起墜毀事件。讓我們談談這十起。我想我們假設自己並非銀河系中最開明、最有愛心、最仁慈的人。是否有任何證據顯示，這些墜毀外星人的同僚曾來尋找他們，或試圖回收他們的墜毀技術，或營救可能被拘禁在此的兄弟姐妹，無論這裡的環境多麼舒適？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. All we're dealing with are leaks and more leaks and stories and claims. It would not be illogical. There have been claims that have been made proving these, getting corroboration is another story.
→ {"text": "我們面對的只是洩密、更多的洩密、故事和說法。這並非不合邏輯。有人聲稱已經證明了這些，但要獲得證實則是另一回事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. Yes, Representative Woolsey.
→ {"text": "請說，伍爾西眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. Thank you. I think we should shorten this as best we can, except for the Honorable Paul Heller. One thing I'd like to say to Paul Heller is, I think we know the answer about who knows about this, when you two guys brought it up. I think Mr. Heller answered it for us. It's the three sisters. I mean, they know of the industrial complexes, the oil cabal, the banking cabal. They know. They've been controlling this for a long time. We know they know, and we know they've been controlling it, so our question is now, what do we do about it? I don't think it does a lot of good to go out and insult the people that are going to have to do something about it, but we can do more than we're doing. We have to get money out of politics, one. I don't mean control the press, what they can see. We have to expand the press so that three or five corporations don't own the communications in our country.
→ {"text": "謝謝。我想我們應該盡量縮短發言，除了尊貴的保羅·赫勒先生。我想對保羅·赫勒先生說的是，當你們兩位提出這個問題時，我想我們已經知道誰知道這件事了。我認為赫勒先生為我們解答了。就是三姐妹組織。我的意思是，他們知道工業複合體、石油集團、銀行集團。他們知道。他們已經控制這件事很長時間了。我們知道他們知道，我們也知道他們一直在控制，所以現在我們的問題是，我們該怎麼辦？我認為去侮辱那些必須採取行動的人並沒有什麼好處，但我們可以做得比現在更多。首先，我們必須讓金錢退出政治。我不是說要控制媒體、控制他們能看到什麼。我們必須擴大媒體規模，這樣三、五家公司就不會壟斷我們國家的通訊業。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Honorable Paul Heller 應為 Paul Hellyer，依據 terminology.yaml 及 topics.json 校正"}

84. We have to do something about our education system so that our students graduate knowing how to question, staying in school in the first place, but they have to learn how to question. They have to learn how to analyze. They have to make decisions that are in their own best interests, not in the best interests of the top 1% of the wealthiest people in this country. We have to have economic justice. I mean, there's so much that we have to do in this country. If we had a country that was not based on money and had a press that would speak truth to power and uneducated public, we'd be demanding and wanting to hear everything that I heard this week from各位。It isn't there, it isn't happening, and we just do, I mean, we have so much work to do. I mean, and then the question of, well, my question is, what would it look like, why would it be upsetting to get this information
→ {"text": "我們必須對教育體系採取行動，讓學生畢業時知道如何質疑，首先是要留在學校，但他們必須學會如何質疑。他們必須學會如何分析。他們必須做出符合自身最佳利益的決定，而不是符合這個國家最富有的百分之一人口的最佳利益。我們必須實現經濟正義。我的意思是，我們在這個國家還有太多事情要做。如果我們擁有一個不建立在金錢基礎上的國家，擁有敢於向權力說真話的媒體，以及未受教育的公眾，我們就會要求並希望聽到我本週從各位這裡聽到的一切。但現實並非如此，這沒有發生，我們只是，我的意思是，我們還有太多工作要做。我的意思是，然後問題是，嗯，我的問題是，這會是什麼樣子，為什麼獲得這些資訊會令人不安", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. out? What does upsetting information look like?
→ {"text": "呢？令人不安的資訊是什麼樣子的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. Well, Ms. Woolsey, if I might have something to say on that. I had a conversation with a gentleman who I will just say is of absolutely impeccable credentials who told me of his personal knowledge of a briefing that was given to President Jimmy Carter back in June of 1977 on exactly this matter. Now, he doesn't know the details of what was said, but he does know that it was a briefing about the extraterrestrial presence. This was in June of 1977, the beginning of his first year. And at the end of that meeting, the President was seen with his head in his hands, elbows on the desk, and weeping or deeply upset.
→ {"text": "嗯，伍爾西女士，如果我可以就此說幾句的話。我曾與一位先生交談，我只能說他的資歷絕對無可挑剔，他告訴我他親知一九七七年六月卡特總統曾就這件事接受過一次簡報。現在，他不知道具體說了什麼，但他確實知道那是一次關於外星存在的簡報。那是在一九七七年六月，他第一任期的開始。而在那次會議結束時，有人看到總統雙手抱頭，手肘撐在桌上，哭泣或深感不安。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. Something was told to him that was very upsetting. I asked this individual if he had any idea what it was. He did not bother to speculate. But I will say that I have another gentleman who was a senior cabinet member in the first Reagan administration, who similarly told of being taken for several weeks after he got his job to an underground facility to receive a briefing and was deeply upset because, as he said to a trusted family member, I have a daughter and I am terrified for her. So there is something going on in which this phenomenon is either threatening or we might speculate beyond the control of the political powers that are officially representing us. Well, it is beyond control. It is the three sisters that are running it. So thank you. Thank you. And let's go to a representative from Maryland. Thank you very much. I want to, for a few
→ {"text": "有人告訴了他一些非常令人不安的事情。我問這個人是否知道那是什麼。他沒有費心去猜測。但我要說的是，我認識另一位先生，他是雷根第一任政府的高級內閣成員，他同樣講述了在就職後幾週被帶到一個地下設施接受簡報的經歷，並且深感不安，因為正如他對一位信任的家人所說的，我有一個女兒，我為她感到恐懼。所以正在發生一些事情，這種現象要麼具有威脅性，要麼我們可以推測它超出了正式代表我們的政治權力的控制範圍。嗯，它確實超出了控制。是三姐妹組織在操控這一切。所以謝謝。謝謝。現在讓我們請馬里蘭州的眾議員發言。非常感謝。我想，用幾", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. moments dwell a bit on a problem that was mentioned by both Mr. Hellyer and Dr. Bookman.
→ {"text": "分鐘的時間，稍微深入探討一下赫勒先生和布克曼醫師都提到的一個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. That is the constitutional issue here. For the moment, we are the undisputed economic and military superpower in the world. We are a bit less than 5% of the world's population.
→ {"text": "那就是這裡的憲法問題。目前，我們是世界上無可爭議的經濟和軍事超級大國。我們的人口不到世界人口的百分之五。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. We are about one person out of 22 in the world. And we have just about, we represent about a fourth of the world's economy, which means we have about a fourth of all the good things in the world. How come? How come? We no longer have the best work ethic in the world. All you have to do is drive around and watch for people bending their back and sweating and working. You won't see very many white faces. You don't see very many black faces. You see Hispanic faces. We no longer have the most respect for the nuclear family. This year, almost half our babies will be born out of wedlock. We no longer have the most respect for technical education. This year, the Chinese will graduate seven times as many engineering students as we graduate. How is it then that we are so darn fortunate that we are the undisputed economic and military superpower in the world? I think it's because of our enormous respect.
→ {"text": "我們大約是世界上每二十二個人中的一個。而我們擁有，我們代表了世界經濟的四分之一，這意味著我們擁有世界上所有美好事物的四分之一。怎麼會這樣？怎麼會這樣？我們不再擁有世界上最好的職業道德。你只需要開車四處看看，觀察那些彎著腰、流汗工作的人。你不會看到很多白人的面孔。你也不會看到很多黑人的面孔。你看到的是拉丁裔的面孔。我們不再最尊重核心家庭。今年，我們幾乎一半的嬰兒將是非婚生子女。我們不再最尊重技術教育。今年，中國畢業的工程專業學生將是我們的七倍。那麼，我們為何如此幸運，成為世界上無可爭議的經濟和軍事超級大國呢？我認為這是因為我們對公民自由的高度尊重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. And we have a fourth of all the good things in the world. I think it's our enormous respect for civil liberties. There's no other constitution. There's no other bill of rights to protect civil liberties like ours. And I think, by the way, you've mentioned it, gentlemen. We are not a democracy. We are a democratic process. But we are a republic, Benjamin Franklin asked.
→ {"text": "我們擁有世界上所有美好事物的四分之一。我認為這是因為我們對公民自由的高度尊重。沒有其他的憲法。沒有其他的權利法案像我們的一樣保護公民自由。順便一提，我想，各位先生，你們已經提到了。我們不是一個民主國家。我們是一個民主程序。但我們是一個共和國，班傑明·富蘭克林曾經問過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. There's a fundamental difference there. There's a fundamental difference there. I'm very concerned that because our government today so easily ignores the constitution to do what they think are good things, that tomorrow, like some of the functions of our government that I think are extra constitutional, if not unconstitutional, like ignoring the First Amendment requirement that the citizens have a right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
→ {"text": "這其中有根本的差異。這其中有根本的差異。我非常擔心，因為我們的政府今天如此輕易地無視憲法去做他們認為是正确的事情，那麼明天，就像我們政府的一些職能，我認為是違憲的，如果不是違憲的話，比如無視第一修正案要求公民有權向政府請願以糾正冤情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. And there's a grievance that there's not been a hearing on this for a very long time.
→ {"text": "而有一項冤情是，已經很長時間沒有就此舉行聽證會了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. If the government can ignore the constitution to be good things today, tomorrow they can ignore the constitution to do bad things. Other countries have done it.
→ {"text": "如果政府今天可以無視憲法去做好事，明天他們就可以無視憲法去做壞事。其他國家已經這樣做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. When my ex-chief of staff, who is now my colleague, called me and asked me if I was interested in this and warned me that there was a big probability that a lot of people would relegate me to the lunatic fringe for coming here. I told her that the primary reason that I would come was that there's a serious constitutional issue here. The citizens have a right for their government to tell them what's going on here. And I want to thank both of you for bringing up this constitutional issue because I think it is a very serious one. A government which ignores the constitution to do good things today, what they think are good things today, can ignore the constitution to do bad things tomorrow because it will rationalize that they are good things tomorrow. So thank you very much for your shared concern of this issue.
→ {"text": "當我的前幕僚長，她現在是我的同事，打電話給我問我是否對此感興趣，並警告我說，如果我來這裡，很有可能很多人會把我歸入瘋狂的邊緣。我告訴她，我來的主要原因是這裡存在一個嚴重的憲法問題。公民有權要求他們的政府告訴他們這裡發生了什麼事。我要感謝你們兩位提出這個憲法問題，因為我認為這是一個非常嚴重的問題。一個今天無視憲法去做好事的政府，他們認為是正确的事，明天就可以無視憲法去做壞事，因為它會合理化這些明天的事是好事。所以非常感謝你們對這個問題的共同關注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
