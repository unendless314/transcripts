## Speaker Group 8

109. Thank you very much. We'll start the closing statements by Senator -- well, is there a -- As much as you want.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. Yeah, you get your closing statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. Don't ever say that to me. I filibuster.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. I should have warned Dr. Buckman about that, but anyway, go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. I'll be reasonable. I'll put it that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. First off, if I've sounded angry, I apologize for that, but there's a reason. I am angry, very angry, but I really want to point out that I love my country. I'm very critical of it because it needs to be criticized heavily. I consider myself a patriot, but I don't buy into -- but first and foremost, and I used to end a lot of my speeches and I lasted for 12 years, I am a citizen of the planet first and American second, and my priorities are on that way. Make no mistake about that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. Now, when we're analyzing the problem, whether it's the extraterrestrial situation issue or the 9/11 issue, which of course ginned up the ability of the crazies to really go after the world, we have to start and be a little humble and say, hey, those of us that have held office for a period of time, it's during that period of time that things have gone to hell, and when people say, well, we ought to take back our country, we never had our country, if you read the Constitution, it was passed in '87 and '89, the first -- we were putting in slavery for infinity, and if you look at -- and those of you that have this brochure, you'll look at all of our forebears that said the people should have the right to change their government, and that's based upon the Declaration of Independence where all human beings are created equal. Well, 12 years later, they're in Philadelphia,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. and they're not creating all human beings equal. What they're doing is they're making a distinction that white males are the only equal ones, and if you have enough property, the rest, and so those who get married to the Constitution, they like to rip the Constitution apart, and then when you say about, you know, obeying the Constitution, after the Civil War amendments, which really is the only improvement made in the Constitution of size because it expanded the franchise, and if you look at the amendments, the rest of it are just housekeeping, and so from the Civil War on, we had 90 years where, what, 12, 13 states were in total violation of the Constitution of the United States, and nobody gave a darn about it, and the political parties were all part of the conspiracy. So when you advance from there to here and look around and see how our scientific advancement has been so explosive, and we are stuck in
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. a system, a structure of governance that's 250 years old that is totally irrelevant to dealing with our problems that we face today, and then so we look at, say, oh, we're going to go to the Congress. I got to tell you, I've said that earlier in the week. It's a dead letter, and hold your breath. It's never going to happen, and it's not that I'm demeaning the Congress. I've been there, and I'll tell you that they don't have the power that you think they have. I don't want to engage in anything. I respect your views, but I just want to tell you that the problem, you have to come to some kind of a search internally with some humility and say, maybe, just maybe, our structure of governance is deficient, is deficient. We don't have a democracy, never had it. What we have is representative government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. That's what came out of the Age of Enlightenment, was representative government, where the majority of the people give their power away to a small minority, and that small minority, and you want to know what happened, $4 billion was spent in the last election in our government, the Congress, the executive, the bureaucracy, the judiciary. They are owned, locked, stocked, and barreled by the Wall Street, the military industrial complex, and all the special interests that we find abroad. Then when you see what's going on with NATO is nothing but the militarization, the globalization of the military industrial complex. That's what's going on. I referred to a study where it showed that 1,300 corporations with interlocking directorates and family ties own 60% of the wealth of the world. Then you've gone through the litany of the Bilderberg group and all of that group. Sure, they do what's natural to them. They've got power,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. and they're clever enough to keep it and work for it. Our task is to look at the structure of why we're failing as human beings. I say all of us, because we've had testimony replete of people in the military who are supposed to be courageous and prepared to charge up the hill, that they defer to authority that silences them. If you reason it out, it doesn't make any sense that they have to keep secrets like that. I had to make that decision in the Senate and put myself at risk when releasing the Pentagon papers. Those were top secret documents. The rest of the Congress was stymied like little kids in school that you could go read it, but you couldn't take any notes. They tried to impeach me, and I was saved by one person, Mike Mansfield. He had such power in the Senate. He stepped before a delegation led by Gerald Ford, brought it with Hugh Scott, went to visit him and said, "Well, we've
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. got to deal with this Gravel for what he's done," and Mansfield turned to him, sucking on his pipe. He says, "He's done nothing that I know of," and they walked right out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. That was the end of the story. That saved my career. When I went to see Mansfield, and I get emotional about it, because what he turned to me says, "Mike, if I had had your courage, I would have done the same thing," but stop and think what I did. The whole Congress had bought into the secrecy of these documents, and I had turned it all over and made the Supreme Court moot and put to shame the newspapers that were now afraid to do it, and the issue with the Supreme Court. Our government, representative government, is designed to keep the people in civic adolescence. That's what it's designed. What is adolescence? "Oh, I want that, but I don't want to pay any taxes. I want that, but I don't want to pay any taxes." That's adolescent behavior. Now, how do we bring the people to adulthood, civic adulthood?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. We do it the way we bring our children up. We give our children responsibility as they age, and then they come to adulthood. It's taking responsibility, but when you have a structure of government that doesn't permit the people to take responsibility, you guarantee the continuation of civic adolescence. What I've tried to do with this work, and this represents the last 25 years of my public life, and it will continue until the day I die, and that is that the answer is the people. It's not your leaders. Don't trust your leaders.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. It's the people. There's only two venues for change. One is the government, wherein structurally the problem exists, and the other is the people. The government won't, but the people can't because they give their power away. I'll close on one quote which says it all, and that is very simple. It's a quote from 2,000 years ago. Marcus Cicero defined freedom as participation in power. You will never, never see fundamental change in our society or global society until the power can be relegated to the people directly. It's just that simple. I make that as a prediction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. I've resigned myself that I'll keep working, but I won't see this in my lifetime. Won't see it in my lifetime, but someday people are going to wake up and say, "Hey, what's so worrisome about empowering the people to be able to do what?" When Cicero says freedom is power, is participation in power, what is the central power of all governments, whether tyrannies or democracy or republics? It's the ability to make laws that stand outside of ourselves and that we're supposed to obey them. At this point in time, only representatives make laws, and these representatives de facto are controlled by these forces beyond our control because they control society. The answer is to find a way to empower people to be able to make laws. Therefore, they will have the power to do away with the secrecy in government. Does it surprise you that 50% of the people don't even care about government?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. This is not Einstein's theory. Well, it is Einstein's theory. He said that to repeat over and over again something that doesn't work is the definition of insanity. That's a great theory. We vote for Democrats, nothing really happens. We vote for Republicans, nothing really happens. We go to Britain, we see one government, that government, nothing really happens to advance the needs of the human race. You can only come to one conclusion that the answer is not with the elites. They manipulate our elections. Mind you, I raise money from special sources to run for office, and I manipulate my constituency. I do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. I'm sure any successful politician has done that, is to manipulate the constituency for your thinking. To think that we in elective office want a turnout of voters, hell no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. We want a turnout of our voters, not the general voters. The whole structure of representative government is very deficient. Let me lead with this, that I have personally unreserved faith in the people. If you don't have faith in the people, what do you have faith in?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. The leaders, and that's exactly where we're at today. If you want to see this issue of being able to maturely, and I don't think we have close to the maturity to deal with the extraterrestrials. We're told, and I'll accept that, that we have the scientific ability to send ET home. Well, it's being sequestered away from the people, and that's a tragedy because there's a lot more out there that could benefit the human race, but we can't get our hands on it because we don't have the structure of governance to be able to go at it. Let me close on it. If those of you that don't have this, you can go to our website, National Citizens Initiative for Democracy. Hopefully, it won't succeed in my lifetime, but it is my contribution and a legacy. Forget the Pentagon Papers, forget the nuclear critique, forget the end of the draft. This is the contribution that I think is worthwhile, and I won't live
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. to see it. Thank you very much. If you will get in your car, and it'll be a little more spectacular in the wintertime because the air is thinner and it holds less moisture, and if you will drive out of the city away from the lights and away from the air pollution, and you drive up a mountain several thousand feet, you don't have to go very far to do that. A hundred miles in West Virginia will do it, and on a cloudless winter night you look up into the sky. You will just be astounded at the Milky Way. Wow, it looks like they took a whitewash brush across the sky. There are so darn many stars there, more than a billion. And then when you recognize that our star is a pretty mediocre star in this galaxy of the Milky Way, and then when you know that there are probably a billion other galaxies this size. You know, as a scientist, there just has to be another sun out there,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. another star, and another planet that has characteristics appropriate for the development of life. And I think you have to be very arrogant and very presumptive to believe that we're the only civilization in the universe, and the most advanced civilization. Wow, we're still killing each other in stupid wars, and not all that long ago, I'm Anglo-Saxon, German, and my forebears were wearing skins in a stone age running around Europe. As I mentioned earlier when my chief of staff, with whom I now work, said that I was invited to come here and warn me that you might be ridiculed for it, I told her that I was going to come because of the constitutional issue for no other, which I mentioned. Because if your government can rationalize that it's okay to deny you this hearing for your good, tomorrow they can be doing a lot of things that are very hurtful to you, because in the grand
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. scheme of things, they will rationalize that it's for your good. Thank you very much, those of you who organized this. I've really been privileged to be here. I'm honored that you invited me to come. And thank you to the witnesses. And I think back through these five days and the witnesses have come, some of them at considerable personal price. And a special thanks to those who have borne this secret for 40, 50 years, and now near their deathbed, come forward so that we can know. I ask myself why this cloak of secrecy? Clearly there is a cloak of secrecy. And I ask myself why. My wife says that I'm the eternal optimist. And I'd like to think the best of everybody until proven different. And so I want to believe that those who made decisions were patriotic Americans, believing that at the time they made the decision which was in the best interest of their country. This was just a few years
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. after the War of the Worlds thing where the East Coast was panicked when they thought we were being invaded by extraterrestrials. And that was one concern that I think they must have had that was fairly recent in their memory. Another concern would be, gee, there really is some advanced technology here, isn't there? And wouldn't it be tragic if the Soviets had that rather than us or shared it with us? And so I think for these two reasons they could very well have rationalized it. And that decision was made very early. Apparently it may have gone clear to the office of the president because within a few hours after they issued that press release that said that a flying saucer had crashed, they came with this ridiculous press release saying, gee, it was just a balloon. We goofed. But they did send what they found to Wright Field and they did send a number of people out to vacuum
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. the area for several days. These three things alone tell me that the Air Force knows that they're not telling us the truth. I hope that after 60-odd years of known incidents after the Soviet Union has gone that these two justifications they recognized are no longer valid and that they might come and tell the American people there is something out there that we can't explain. And we're sorry that for all these years that we rationalized that it was the national interest of our country to keep this from you. I may be the eternal optimist but I'd like to thank the best of people. Again, thank you so very much for putting this on. Thank you for honoring me to be a part of it. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. I certainly want to thank everybody that's been involved in this whole operation this week and I just want to say how grateful I am for being contacted and asked to participate and how glad I am that I accepted this opportunity to be on this panel. But I want to focus my closing statement and keep it very short on the witnesses. I still can't believe the quality of the witnesses that we've seen this week has been about 40, about 40. This is meant as a total compliment. I can't, when I contemplated coming here to Washington for this, I certainly couldn't imagine that you could assemble in one conference that number of people with that level of capability, competence, commitment, and intelligence. The witnesses are far better than I think anyone of us had a right to expect when we accepted this. And maybe it's because I don't know enough about ufology. And Congressman, there is five more behind every one of those
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. 40 that can come forward just as strong. I'm starting to have no doubt about that at all after hearing just a small sampling of pilots and controllers and people on the ground that have seen things and witnessed things. And the integrity and believability, honesty, and clear thought of each of these testimonies was something to behold. I have to say that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. I'm just very impressed on that. And I'm going to conclude the remarks by saying to all of the witnesses and each and every one witness, if you're a researcher, you keep on researching and redouble those research efforts. If you're someone in the media that's trying to understand this and help promote it, work harder at it. And if, I mean, you're doing a good job, don't get me wrong, but I just want you to redouble this. Because, you know, if it's true, I've announced before I even came here that I believe in extraterrestrial life. And that was from a religious standpoint. So I've been focusing on scientific evidence of it. And let me just say this. I'm like, sorry the name slips through me, but the person that used to be the minister of, or in the Ministry of Defense, Nick Pope. I'm like Nick Pope. I haven't come to a definite scientific conclusion on that question. But I hope in the short lifetime I have left,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. I can, based on science. And if you researchers will redouble the efforts and if anybody that can help fund and resource this kind of effort can get committed and get going, because hey, I can tell you this must have cost some real money, what you've done here. And that's a compliment to the fundraising skill that you obviously all have that have been involved.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. So I'd just like to end with this final sentence. Keep working hard. Use this as just kind of a springboard to redoubling your efforts. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. Well, I want to thank my colleagues and thanks for putting this group of six together. It could not have been better balanced. It was balanced politically. It was balanced gender-wise, absolutely. And it was balanced with our beliefs. And it's so clear. People say we don't get along. We get along. And when you take the politics out of it, it makes it a lot easier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. And I will say what we say in the Congress when we want to save time, is that I echo our chairman's viewpoint on the witnesses. He said it perfectly. The knowledge, the experience, and the integrity of this group of witnesses made it such an important week for me and I know for many others. Actually, with this amazing group of witnesses that we heard, and as we talked about this subject, it made it absolutely impossible for me to remain a skeptic. But I don't believe that it's about -- I don't believe it's about belief.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. I believe this whole situation is about information. And the existence of UFOs and ETs is becoming accepted worldwide. And the information we received was so important to support that and defend it. But it's time for our government, the U.S. government, to come to the party.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. It's time for our government to declassify and disclose what they know. And it is time that they trust the people of this country, that they can handle this information, whatever they think we can't handle, because they are dead wrong and it's going to get in the way of the get-along of this nation we live in. So we're not living in a flat-earth society.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. We know it, and it's time that our government realizes it, as well, and that they make it possible for us to go forward. Because if they don't, I agree that the general public will. And I thank you again for making this all possible. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Absolutely blessed to have been given the opportunity to fill Congresswoman Hooley's seat when she left earlier today. I'd like to echo what Congressman Cook said about the heroic actions of the witnesses who came here this week. And what Congressman Bartlett said about those brilliant stars under that winter night in West Virginia. But what I'm here to suggest is that we have stars who've shone just as brightly this week and other human beings who are here who were just as heroic. And I'd like to share a little bit about that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. I shared my gratitude for Congressman Kilpatrick, who was the first to say, "Yeah, I'll do it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. But there's other stories around that I'd like to share that I'd like everyone in the room to be aware of as well. Just before I do that, though, I'd also like to make a call-out to those watching this on the Internet stream, or those who might be in the room, or those who might see it in the weeks, months, years to come, who have the opportunity to be heroic, who do know about this, who have evidence, who could testify, who live perhaps in fear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. And my call-out to you is to do what these six members of Congress have done, which is to be heroic, to stand up and recognize an allegiance, if not to the Constitution, then to your fellow men on this planet, men and women on the planet, to share what you know to be true about this issue. Congressman Bartlett has been commuting two and a half hours every morning to be here, two and a half hours back to his farm in Virginia. He's 86 years old. [applause] Sir, you're a hero to me. Your commitment to our Constitution and the principles of liberty that it embodies, and yes, Senator Gravel's right, it never embodied them perfectly, but it was a huge advance in the history of humanity on this planet to grant liberty to the people, to see the government not as the giver of rights, but as of rights being self-evident and inalienable, inalienable for each individual.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. Your commitment to that is heroic. Congressman Woolsey, who's sitting next to me right now, authored legislation to protect whistleblowers that this government, this Congress, refused to pass. And we've been, if you haven't noticed, attacking whistleblowers for at least the last 12 years at an ever-increasing rate. It's unconstitutional. It's anti-liberty.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. It's criminal. And she and I have partnered on bringing greater freedom to other social organizations and inclusiveness in other battles not related to this issue. I mentioned Carolyn being first earlier, and I want to say how great a gift that was to all of us putting this together. Again, somebody had to be first. Senator Gravel, when I called him, said, "Do you mind if I quote you on this and share a private phone call for a bit, Senator, in the world of full disclosure?" He said, "How much money are you offering again? God damn it, I usually do these things for free, and this is the first time I can't go. My wife and I just made plans to be on a cruise on the Danube at that time, and he changed his vacation plans to be here." Canceled his vacation. Very few people in this room know, but just this past Sunday, Congresswoman Hooley was in the hotel, the Washington Plaza sobbing
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. because she had just learned her sister had died a couple of days earlier in California, and she'd had the opportunity to say goodbye to her sister, but she was devastated, and she came here anyway. That's a hero to all of us. Then one more, and I'll conclude, but I think it's fair to say as a fairly hardcore libertarian, I've had a seething contempt for most of Congress, for most of my life. I'm currently serving as the chair of the National Libertarian Party's platform committee, and thinking about these issues of how do we save what was once the land of the free and the home of the brave, and has become the land of the bailed out and the home of the terrorized by the tyranny of its government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. And I've fallen in love with Congress this week. You all have been learning about UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. I've been learning about the great character of the men and women who actually do serve this nation, and if you're representatives of what's still there, even a portion of it, all hope is not lost. Merrill Cook invited me to come down and brief him. He lives about a half hour from my home in Park City, and when I got there I discovered that he's the full-time caretaker for the love of his life, Camille, and he has every door of his house locked from the inside out so that she doesn't wander off. She's suffering from Alzheimer's.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. And his one concern before he agreed to be here was, "If I come, would it be possible for my wife to be in the audience where I could see her so that I know she's okay, because I'll never put her in an institution? She's the love of my life, but I need to have her in a seat where I can see her with someone sitting next to her so I can focus on the testimony. And sir, if I could love my wife half as much as I've seen you as an example of love to yours, I'll be okay." You, sir, are a hero as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. First of all, I would like to thank the panel. You'll be interested to know that I had considerable empathy with you to see all of that information being thrown at you so fast, and on a subject which was completely foreign to you. And you did a remarkable job of accepting it, adjusting it and being, in effect, transformed by it. And how I wish that more people would be in that position so that we could really get the word out and get the kind of action that we dream of. But as the Senator says, it may be just a dream, but I hope not, because time is running out. So thank you very much, every one of you. You are great, and we appreciate what you have done. And just hope, Mr. Chairman, that you too all redouble your effort when you go out to try and influence people to expose themselves to this kind of information so that they too may understand. And the witnesses, I must say, I agree with everything that's
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. been said about them. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Just absolutely transfixed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. I've seen more heroes in five days than I've seen ever before in my life, except perhaps on VE Day or something. But just wonderful people who are willing to stick their necks out because they are deeply, deeply committed in the search of truth. And that's what we've got to do. I hesitate to mention names because every single one of them should be singled up. I was particularly thankful this morning to both Richard and Linda that they got us into some of the things that we hadn't been in before. And I will never forget Colonel French admitting that his job was to invent the excuses for the UFOs and that he designated a lot of them as swamp gas. We all knew that the swamp gas and the plasma and the balloons and all this sort of stuff was you know what. But to have him say so was -- but he said something else that I think that is even more memorable to me. And that is never put weapons
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. in space. We adhere to the space treaty. Google the space treaty and listen to Carol Ross and on the reasons why we should have a common access to the space, everybody. And not try to see if we can outwit other people in being the first to spend a lot of money putting weapons in space. And I feel very strongly on that. It's an issue which I have been involved in for a long while and which I will continue to support. And final word is Bob Sallis I also remember because he summed up the situation in one classic sentence. It's power and greed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. It's not national security. That's what I believe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. And Paul mentioned heroes. Let me introduce one now. Jesse, do you have a few words to say before we leave?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. Well, I have a few words. I'll keep these remarks short because everything has already been said really. But I do want to express my appreciation and honor in presenting my story to this panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. Since 1947, I have known that we're not alone in this universe. Because based on the material I saw that my dad brought in from the desert, I realized this is not a human manufacture.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. So if we didn't make it, it means somebody else did. And when you look out at the night stars, night sky there in New Mexico, you realize this beautiful place that we live in is called the universe, or our galaxy. As a matter of fact, there's 10 of the 22nd power stars in the known galaxy, which equates the number of grains of sand on the beaches of the earth. And to say that only one grain of sand out of that multitude has sentient life like us around it is just begging the question there. Because someone once said very truthfully that if we're the only ones here, there's an awful lot of wasted space out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. So anyway, I started thinking about this. People ask me, "How does this affect my religion, my belief in God?" Well, I believe in the intelligent design. Because if in the very beginning at the Big Bang, when things were created, if the parameters were changed just ever so slightly, like the rate of expansion of the universe, or the charge on the proton, or the electron, or the masses thereof, had that been off by 1 trillion from what it turned out to be, we wouldn't be here, nor would our cousins from outer space be here too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. And I, you know, I'll give you my philosophy. I think we're all related. People of earth, people of star status, you know, wherever they come from, we're all related to them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. Because in the very beginning when the Big Bang occurred, there's something called quantum entanglement that occurred. And Einstein calls this spooky action at a distance, but that means that all particles created in the Big Bang are related to each other. One example is where they would take two matched particles, send one of them, could be light years away, but you'd make one change and one, the other one changes correspondingly instantly. Like there's faster than light communication.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. So again, we're all related, we're in this universe, and we have a lot of cousins out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. [Applause]
