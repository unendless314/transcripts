109. Thank you very much. We'll start the closing statements by Senator -- well, is there a -- As much as you want.

111. Don't ever say that to me. I filibuster.

113. I'll be reasonable. I'll put it that way.

114. First off, if I've sounded angry, I apologize for that, but there's a reason. I am angry, very angry, but I really want to point out that I love my country. I'm very critical of it because it needs to be criticized heavily. I consider myself a patriot, but I don't buy into -- but first and foremost, and I used to end a lot of my speeches and I lasted for 12 years, I am a citizen of the planet first and American second, and my priorities are on that way. Make no mistake about that.

115. Now, when we're analyzing the problem, whether it's the extraterrestrial situation issue or the 9/11 issue, which of course ginned up the ability of the crazies to really go after the world, we have to start and be a little humble and say, hey, those of us that have held office for a period of time, it's during that period of time that things have gone to hell, and when people say, well, we ought to take back our country, we never had our country, if you read the Constitution, it was passed in '87 and '89, the first -- we were putting in slavery for infinity, and if you look at -- and those of you that have this brochure, you'll look at all of our forebears that said the people should have the right to change their government, and that's based upon the Declaration of Independence where all human beings are created equal. Well, 12 years later, they're in Philadelphia,
→ {"text": "現在，當我們分析問題時，無論是外星情況問題還是九一一問題——這當然讓那些瘋狂分子有了真正攻擊世界的能力——我們必須先謙卑地說，嘿，我們這些曾經擔任公職一段時間的人，正是在那段時間事情變得一團糟，而當人們說，我們應該奪回我們的國家時，我們從來沒有真正擁有過我們的國家，如果你讀過憲法，它是在八七年和八九年通過的，最初——我們是在將奴隸制永久化，如果你看看——你們當中有這本小冊子的人，你們會看到我們所有的先輩都說人民應該有權改變他們的政府，這是基於獨立宣言，其中說人人生而平等。嗯，十二年後，他們在費城，", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. and they're not creating all human beings equal. What they're doing is they're making a distinction that white males are the only equal ones, and if you have enough property, the rest, and so those who get married to the Constitution, they like to rip the Constitution apart, and then when you say about, you know, obeying the Constitution, after the Civil War amendments, which really is the only improvement made in the Constitution of size because it expanded the franchise, and if you look at the amendments, the rest of it are just housekeeping, and so from the Civil War on, we had 90 years where, what, 12, 13 states were in total violation of the Constitution of the United States, and nobody gave a darn about it, and the political parties were all part of the conspiracy. So when you advance from there to here and look around and see how our scientific advancement has been so explosive, and we are stuck in

117. a system, a structure of governance that's 250 years old that is totally irrelevant to dealing with our problems that we face today, and then so we look at, say, oh, we're going to go to the Congress. I got to tell you, I've said that earlier in the week. It's a dead letter, and hold your breath. It's never going to happen, and it's not that I'm demeaning the Congress. I've been there, and I'll tell you that they don't have the power that you think they have. I don't want to engage in anything. I respect your views, but I just want to tell you that the problem, you have to come to some kind of a search internally with some humility and say, maybe, just maybe, our structure of governance is deficient, is deficient. We don't have a democracy, never had it. What we have is representative government.
→ {"text": "一個有兩百五十年歷史的治理體系和結構中，這與我們今天面臨的問題完全無關，然後所以我們看看，說，哦，我們要去找國會。我必須告訴你們，我這週早些時候就說過了。這是一紙空文，別抱希望。這永遠不會發生，而且這不是我在貶低國會。我去過那裡，我告訴你們，他們沒有你們想像的那種權力。我不想捲入任何事情。我尊重你們的觀點，但我只想告訴你們，這個問題，你們必須帶著謙卑的心進行某種內在探索，並說，也許，只是也許，我們的治理結構是有缺陷的，是有缺陷的。我們沒有民主，從來沒有過。我們有的是代議制政府。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. That's what came out of the Age of Enlightenment, was representative government, where the majority of the people give their power away to a small minority, and that small minority, and you want to know what happened, $4 billion was spent in the last election in our government, the Congress, the executive, the bureaucracy, the judiciary. They are owned, locked, stocked, and barreled by the Wall Street, the military industrial complex, and all the special interests that we find abroad. Then when you see what's going on with NATO is nothing but the militarization, the globalization of the military industrial complex. That's what's going on. I referred to a study where it showed that 1,300 corporations with interlocking directorates and family ties own 60% of the wealth of the world. Then you've gone through the litany of the Bilderberg group and all of that group. Sure, they do what's natural to them. They've got power,

119. and they're clever enough to keep it and work for it. Our task is to look at the structure of why we're failing as human beings. I say all of us, because we've had testimony replete of people in the military who are supposed to be courageous and prepared to charge up the hill, that they defer to authority that silences them. If you reason it out, it doesn't make any sense that they have to keep secrets like that. I had to make that decision in the Senate and put myself at risk when releasing the Pentagon papers. Those were top secret documents. The rest of the Congress was stymied like little kids in school that you could go read it, but you couldn't take any notes. They tried to impeach me, and I was saved by one person, Mike Mansfield. He had such power in the Senate. He stepped before a delegation led by Gerald Ford, brought it with Hugh Scott, went to visit him and said, "Well, we've

121. That was the end of the story. That saved my career. When I went to see Mansfield, and I get emotional about it, because what he turned to me says, "Mike, if I had had your courage, I would have done the same thing," but stop and think what I did. The whole Congress had bought into the secrecy of these documents, and I had turned it all over and made the Supreme Court moot and put to shame the newspapers that were now afraid to do it, and the issue with the Supreme Court. Our government, representative government, is designed to keep the people in civic adolescence. That's what it's designed. What is adolescence? "Oh, I want that, but I don't want to pay any taxes. I want that, but I don't want to pay any taxes." That's adolescent behavior. Now, how do we bring the people to adulthood, civic adulthood?
→ {"text": "故事就這樣結束了。那救了我的職業生涯。當我去見曼斯菲爾德時，我對此很激動，因為他轉向我說：「邁克，如果我有你的勇氣，我也會做同樣的事，」但停下來想想我做了什麼。整個國會都接受了這些文件的保密性，而我卻將全部公開，讓最高法院變得無關緊要，並讓那些現在不敢這樣做的報社感到羞愧，還有最高法院的問題。我們的政府，代議制政府，其設計目的就是讓人民保持在公民青春期。這就是它的設計目的。什麼是青春期？「哦，我想要那個，但我不想付任何稅。我想要那個，但我不想付任何稅。」這就是青少年行為。現在，我們如何讓人民走向成年，公民成年？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. We do it the way we bring our children up. We give our children responsibility as they age, and then they come to adulthood. It's taking responsibility, but when you have a structure of government that doesn't permit the people to take responsibility, you guarantee the continuation of civic adolescence. What I've tried to do with this work, and this represents the last 25 years of my public life, and it will continue until the day I die, and that is that the answer is the people. It's not your leaders. Don't trust your leaders.
→ {"text": "我們用撫養孩子的方式來做到這一點。我們隨著孩子年齡增長給予他們責任，然後他們就會成年。這就是承擔責任，但當你有一個不允許人民承擔責任的政府結構時，你就保證了公民青春期的延續。我在這項工作中一直試圖做的，這代表了我公共生活的最後二十五年，而且會持續到我死的那一天，那就是答案在於人民。不在於你們的領導人。不要信任你們的領導人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. It's the people. There's only two venues for change. One is the government, wherein structurally the problem exists, and the other is the people. The government won't, but the people can't because they give their power away. I'll close on one quote which says it all, and that is very simple. It's a quote from 2,000 years ago. Marcus Cicero defined freedom as participation in power. You will never, never see fundamental change in our society or global society until the power can be relegated to the people directly. It's just that simple. I make that as a prediction.
→ {"text": "在於人民。改變只有兩個途徑。一個是政府，問題在結構上就存在於其中，另一個是人民。政府不會改變，但人民不能改變，因為他們把權力交出去了。我將用一句話來結束，這句話說明了一切，而且非常簡單。這是兩千年前的一句話。馬庫斯·西塞羅將自由定義為參與權力。你永遠、永遠不會看到我們的社會或全球社會發生根本性改變，直到權力可以直接下放給人民。就是這麼簡單。我以此作為預測。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. I've resigned myself that I'll keep working, but I won't see this in my lifetime. Won't see it in my lifetime, but someday people are going to wake up and say, "Hey, what's so worrisome about empowering the people to be able to do what?" When Cicero says freedom is power, is participation in power, what is the central power of all governments, whether tyrannies or democracy or republics? It's the ability to make laws that stand outside of ourselves and that we're supposed to obey them. At this point in time, only representatives make laws, and these representatives de facto are controlled by these forces beyond our control because they control society. The answer is to find a way to empower people to be able to make laws. Therefore, they will have the power to do away with the secrecy in government. Does it surprise you that 50% of the people don't even care about government?
→ {"text": "我已經認命我會繼續努力，但我在有生之年不會看到這一天。不會在我的有生之年看到，但總有一天人們會醒來說：「嘿，賦予人民權力去做事，有什麼好擔心的？」當西塞羅說自由就是權力，就是參與權力時，所有政府的核心權力是什麼，無論是專制、民主還是共和國？那就是制定凌駕於我們自身之上、我們應該遵守的法律的能力。在這個時候，只有代表制定法律，而這些代表實際上被這些超出我們控制的力量所控制，因為他們控制著社會。答案是要找到一種方法賦予人民制定法律的能力。因此，他們將有權力消除政府中的保密。百分之五十的人甚至不在乎政府，這讓你驚訝嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

125. This is not Einstein's theory. Well, it is Einstein's theory. He said that to repeat over and over again something that doesn't work is the definition of insanity. That's a great theory. We vote for Democrats, nothing really happens. We vote for Republicans, nothing really happens. We go to Britain, we see one government, that government, nothing really happens to advance the needs of the human race. You can only come to one conclusion that the answer is not with the elites. They manipulate our elections. Mind you, I raise money from special sources to run for office, and I manipulate my constituency. I do that.
→ {"text": "這不是愛因斯坦的理論。嗯，這確實是愛因斯坦的理論。他說，一再重複做無效的事情就是瘋狂的定義。這是個偉大的理論。我們投票給民主黨，什麼也沒發生。我們投票給共和黨，什麼也沒發生。我們去英國，看到一個政府，那個政府，什麼也沒發生來推進人類的需求。你只能得出一個結論，答案不在精英身上。他們操縱我們的選舉。請注意，我從特殊來源籌集資金來競選公職，而我操縱我的選民。我這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. I'm sure any successful politician has done that, is to manipulate the constituency for your thinking. To think that we in elective office want a turnout of voters, hell no.

127. We want a turnout of our voters, not the general voters. The whole structure of representative government is very deficient. Let me lead with this, that I have personally unreserved faith in the people. If you don't have faith in the people, what do you have faith in?
→ {"text": "我們希望我們的選民出來投票，而不是一般選民。整個代議制政府的結構是非常有缺陷的。讓我先說這一點，我個人對人民有毫無保留的信心。如果你對人民沒有信心，你對什麼有信心？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. The leaders, and that's exactly where we're at today. If you want to see this issue of being able to maturely, and I don't think we have close to the maturity to deal with the extraterrestrials. We're told, and I'll accept that, that we have the scientific ability to send ET home. Well, it's being sequestered away from the people, and that's a tragedy because there's a lot more out there that could benefit the human race, but we can't get our hands on it because we don't have the structure of governance to be able to go at it. Let me close on it. If those of you that don't have this, you can go to our website, National Citizens Initiative for Democracy. Hopefully, it won't succeed in my lifetime, but it is my contribution and a legacy. Forget the Pentagon Papers, forget the nuclear critique, forget the end of the draft. This is the contribution that I think is worthwhile, and I won't live

A hundred miles in West Virginia will do it, and on a cloudless winter night you look up into the sky. You will just be astounded at the Milky Way. Wow, it looks like they took a whitewash brush across the sky. There are so darn many stars there, more than a billion.

And wouldn't it be tragic if the Soviets had that rather than us or shared it with us? And so I think for these two reasons they could very well have rationalized it. And that decision was made very early. Apparently it may have gone clear to the office of the president because within a few hours after they issued that press release that said that a flying saucer had crashed, they came with this ridiculous press release saying, gee, it was just a balloon.

I'd like to echo what Congressman Cook said about the heroic actions of the witnesses who came here this week. And what Congressman Bartlett said about those brilliant stars under that winter night in West Virginia.

Congressman Bartlett has been commuting two and a half hours every morning to be here, two and a half hours back to his farm in Virginia. He's 86 years old. [applause] Sir, you're a hero to me. Your commitment to our Constitution and the principles of liberty that it embodies, and yes, Senator Gravel's right, it never embodied them perfectly, but it was a huge advance in the history of humanity on this planet to grant liberty to the people, to see the government not as the giver of rights, but as of rights being self-evident and inalienable, inalienable for each individual.

I mentioned Carolyn being first earlier, and I want to say how great a gift that was to all of us putting this together. Again, somebody had to be first. Senator Gravel, when I called him, said, "Do you mind if I quote you on this and share a private phone call for a bit, Senator, in the world of full disclosure?" He said, "How much money are you offering again? God damn it, I usually do these things for free, and this is the first time I can't go.

I'm currently serving as the chair of the National Libertarian Party's platform committee, and thinking about these issues of how do we save what was once the land of the free and the home of the brave, and has become the land of the bailed out and the home of the terrorized by the tyranny of its government.

I've been learning about the great character of the men and women who actually do serve this nation, and if you're representatives of what's still there, even a portion of it, all hope is not lost.

He lives about a half hour from my home in Park City, and when I got there I discovered that he's the full-time caretaker for the love of his life, Camille, and he has every door of his house locked from the inside out so that she doesn't wander off.

And how I wish that more people would be in that position so that we could really get the word out and get the kind of action that we dream of. But as the Senator says, it may be just a dream, but I hope not, because time is running out. So thank you very much, every one of you. You are great, and we appreciate what you have done.

I hesitate to mention names because every single one of them should be singled up. I was particularly thankful this morning to both Richard and Linda that they got us into some of the things that we hadn't been in before.

And when you look out at the night stars, night sky there in New Mexico, you realize this beautiful place that we live in is called the universe, or our galaxy. As a matter of fact, there's 10 of the 22nd power stars in the known galaxy, which equates the number of grains of sand on the beaches of the earth.

165. Because in the very beginning when the Big Bang occurred, there's something called quantum entanglement that occurred. And Einstein calls this spooky action at a distance, but that means that all particles created in the Big Bang are related to each other. One example is where they would take two matched particles, send one of them, could be light years away, but you'd make one change and one, the other one changes correspondingly instantly. Like there's faster than light communication.
