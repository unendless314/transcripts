## Speaker Group 8

41. Thank you very much. We'll now hear from Richard Dolan for ten minutes.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。現在我們請 Richard Dolan（理查德·多蘭）發言十分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. Thank you, distinguished members of the committee, and let me just say it's been an honor for me personally to be here with you all week to be able to give statements to you and chat with some of you privately as well.
→ {"text": "感謝各位尊敬的委員會成員，請容我說，本週能與各位齊聚一堂，向各位陳述意見並與部分委員私下交流，對我個人而言實屬榮幸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. Regarding disclosure, I have often felt that disclosure on the matter of UFOs and ETs, possible extraterrestrials, is a paradox. It's impossible, but it is inevitable. It's impossible because there is no political motivation for it. It's inevitable, however, because our leaders are not the only factor in this equation. There are other beings, after all, but mainly I would say there is us, the people, who are going through this greatest social, cultural, and especially technological transformation in the history of humanity. In fact, I would say that we are the game changers.
→ {"text": "關於真相揭露（Disclosure），我時常認為，針對 UFO 與 ET（外星生命體），也就是可能存在的外星生物，進行真相揭露是一個悖論。這是不可能的，但卻是不可避免的。不可能，是因為沒有政治動機促使這麼做；然而不可避免，是因為我們的領導者並非這個方程式中的唯一因素。畢竟還有其他生命體存在，但我主要想說的是，還有我們——人民——我們正經歷人類歷史上最偉大的社會、文化，尤其是技術變革。事實上，我認為我們才是改變遊戲規則的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "disclosure 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「真相揭露」；ET 首次出現加註「外星生命體」；game changers 譯為「改變遊戲規則的人」"}

44. One day, and it won't be too long in the future, something is going to force someone's hand. It could be a major sighting. It could be a major leak. Something. Something that can no longer be denied. After all, we are fast approaching what experts in artificial intelligence call the singularity when computing intelligence exceeds our own. In such a future, I ask you, can we really think we will still be stuck in neutral on this issue? Something will force the president's hand. He or she will finally hold that long-awaited press conference and make that bombshell statement. It might go something like this.
→ {"text": "總有一天，而且不會太久，某件事將會迫使某人攤牌。可能是一次重大目擊事件，可能是一次重大洩密，總之是某件再也無法否認的事情。畢竟，我們正快速逼近人工智慧專家所稱的技術奇點（singularity），也就是運算智慧超越人類智慧的臨界點。在這樣的未來，請問各位，我們真的認為自己在這個議題上還會繼續原地踏步嗎？某件事將迫使總統不得不採取行動。他或她終將舉行那場期待已久的記者會，發表那項震撼聲明。內容可能會是這樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "singularity 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「技術奇點」；force someone's hand 譯為「迫使某人攤牌」；stuck in neutral 譯為「原地踏步」"}

45. I have been advised by the National Security Council and heads of our intelligence community that there is a reality to some of the UFO phenomenon, in that some UFOs are real physical craft not manufactured by any known civilization on earth. Or words to that effect.
→ {"text": "國家安全會議（National Security Council）及情報機構首長已向我報告，部分 UFO 現象確實存在，亦即某些 UFO 是真實的物理飛行器，並非由地球上任何已知文明所製造。或是類似這樣的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "National Security Council 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「國家安全會議」"}

46. It's the kind of statement that many proponents of UFO disclosure would like to hear, but the real question is what next? Because there would be quite a few follow-up questions.
→ {"text": "這是許多支持 UFO 真相揭露的人士希望聽到的聲明，但真正的問題是：接下來呢？因為將會出現相當多的後續問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. At the top of the list will be questions about who these other beings are and what their agenda or agendas might be. This will be a very difficult question for any president to answer. In the first place, there is a likelihood that even the leaders of the black budget or breakaway society that have been on top of this for years, they may not even know. Or at least not fully. And what if they do know? And moreover, what if at least some of that answer includes information that might be upsetting? Divining the intentions of non-human visitors, or permanent residents, whatever they may be, might not be the easiest thing to do. But it's entirely possible, judging from the data we do have, that some of them may not care very much about humanity. Some may. Some may not. And what if an agenda has been determined within the intelligence community
→ {"text": "首要的問題將是關於這些其他生命體是誰，以及他們的目的或目的為何。這對任何總統而言都將是極難回答的問題。首先，很有可能，即使是多年來主導此事的黑預算（black budget）或脫離文明（breakaway society）的領導者，他們也可能並不知情，或至少不完全知情。而如果他們確實知情呢？再者，如果部分答案包含可能令人不安的資訊呢？探知非人類訪客，或永久居民，無論他們是什麼，其意圖可能不是一件容易的事。但根據我們現有的資料，完全有可能其中一些並不太在乎人類，有些可能在乎，有些可能不在乎。而如果情報機構內部已經確定了某種目的呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "black budget 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「黑預算」；breakaway society 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「脫離文明」"}

48. and this agenda includes something to do with alleged abduction phenomenon? And even if that isn't true, does any president honestly believe he or she can contain rampant speculation along these lines? And even if the intentions of these other beings are said to be neutral or positive, there will clearly be tremendous suspicion by large swaths of humanity. This will not be an easy sell. There will already be a sizable number of people predisposed to interpreting these other beings as nothing less than demonic, short of bringing one of these entities to a podium and subjecting it to hours and days and weeks of questions by an insatiable public. It's very likely that any moment of disclosure will not satisfy the public the way it would like to be regarding alien motivations. That's only the beginning of the problems. One early and obvious question that will arise, one which will have deep,
→ {"text": "而這個目的涉及所謂的綁架現象呢？即使這不是真的，有任何總統真的相信他或她能夠遏制這類肆無忌憚的臆測嗎？即使這些其他生命體的意圖被說成是中立或正面的，顯然仍會有大批人類抱持極大的懷疑。這不會是容易說服大眾的事。除非把其中一個生命體帶到講台上，讓永不滿足的公眾對它進行數小時、數天、數週的質問，否則已經會有相當多的人傾向於將這些生命體解讀為不折不扣的惡魔。真相揭露的任何時刻，很可能都無法讓公眾如其所願地滿意於對外星生命動機的解釋。這還只是問題的開端。一個早期且明顯將浮現的問題，一個將具有深遠影響的問題，將會非常簡單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "abduction phenomenon 譯為「綁架現象」；demonic 譯為「惡魔」；short of 譯為「除非」；insatiable 譯為「永不滿足的」"}

49. profound political implications, will be very simple. How long have you managed to keep this secret all these years? Consider that our entire society has been told that UFOs do not represent anything truly anomalous, that ETs or aliens are definitely not here on earth interacting with us, that UFO believers may be well-meaning but had been mistaken about all of that. This has been a mindset embedded within all of our major institutions.
→ {"text": "具有深遠政治意涵的問題，將會非常簡單：這些年來，你們是怎麼成功守住這個秘密的？請想想，我們整個社會一直被灌輸 UFO 並不代表任何真正異常的事物，外星生命體（ET）或外星人肯定不在地球上與我們互動，UFO 信仰者或許出於善意，但對這一切都搞錯了。這種思維模式已經深植於我們所有主要機構之中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. Our educational institutions from primary school through universities and postdoctoral levels throughout our major news organizations in which an open belief in UFOs is a third rail for one's career, throughout our scientific establishment for sure and also throughout our political structure. Political careers have been destroyed or at least severely undermined by the UFO taint. Remember what happened to Dennis Kucinich in 2008 after it became known that many years before he had seen a UFO. Never mind the fact that the two witnesses he had been with came out and corroborated the sighting. They saw the same thing. All of these institutions and others have treated the UFO topic as nothing more than a joke, something suitable for immature minds. Can it really be that the professors throughout the United States uniformly have dismissed this phenomenon without any cooperation from
→ {"text": "我們的教育機構，從小學到大學再到博士後層級；我們的主要新聞機構，在這些機構中公開相信 UFO 是職業生涯的致命傷；我們的科學機構，當然也包括我們的政治體系。政治生涯因 UFO 的污名而被摧毀，或至少嚴重受損。還記得 2008 年 Dennis Kucinich（丹尼斯·庫辛尼奇）發生了什麼事嗎？當時外界得知他多年前曾目擊 UFO。別管與他同行的兩位證人出面證實了那次目擊，他們看到了同樣的東西。所有這些機構，以及其他機構，都將 UFO 議題視為不過是個笑話，只適合不成熟的心智。難道全美國的教授們真的在沒有任何合作的情況下，一致否定了這個現象嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Dennis Kucinich 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「丹尼斯·庫辛尼奇」；third rail 譯為「致命傷」，比喻政治上的禁忌議題"}

51. the intelligence community? Ditto the world of science, politics and media. Well, no.
→ {"text": "情報機構嗎？科學界、政界和媒體界也是如此。嗯，不可能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Ditto 譯為「也是如此」"}

52. Not when the most modest amount of research shows strong intelligence community influence over all of these institutions. In other words, people will see very clearly that the national security apparatus has created a global culture that has suffocated the truth. Researchers will begin to investigate in a serious way just how these relationships have undermined the credibility of all those institutions and undermined our apprehension of truth.
→ {"text": "因為只要做最基礎的研究就會發現，情報機構對所有這些機構都有強大的影響力。換句話說，人們將會非常清楚地看到，國家安全機器創造了一種窒息真相的全球文化。研究人員將開始認真調查這些關係是如何破壞所有這些機構的可信度，以及如何破壞我們對真相的理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "apprehension of truth 譯為「對真相的理解」"}

53. The result will be a major cultural and institutional house cleaning, but it won't stop there.
→ {"text": "結果將會是一場重大的文化與機構大清洗，但這還不會停止。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "house cleaning 譯為「大清洗」，指徹底的整頓與改革"}

54. Investors will naturally want to know specifics about the structure of secrecy itself. That is, they will want to know if the U.S. president has been out of the loop all these years, as it seems, then who exactly has been in the loop? Who has been running the UFO cover-up?
→ {"text": "調查人員自然會想要知道保密結構本身的具體細節。也就是說，他們會想知道，如果美國總統這些年來一直都被蒙在鼓裡，正如表面看來如此，那麼到底誰才是知情者？誰一直在主導 UFO 掩蓋行動？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "out of the loop 譯為「被蒙在鼓裡」；in the loop 譯為「知情者」"}

55. If the answer is anything along the lines of my own research so far, it will show that the cover-up has long ago gravitated away from formal presidential authority into international and private hands. It's not that the U.S. president is a non-player in all of this, but rather is more like the public face of the true power精英 that stands behind. We all, I think, have come to understand this when it comes to power in general, and this will likely be the case when we begin a sophisticated analysis of UFO secrecy. In other words, the moment of disclosure will trigger an intellectual revolution worldwide relating to the true structure of power on planet Earth. It will be a moment in which the world sees and acknowledges that the emperor has been wearing nothing at all. The political fallout will be tremendous and a great battle will develop within the first year of disclosure. Think of it this
→ {"text": "如果答案與我目前的研究方向一致，那將顯示這個掩蓋行動早已脫離正式的總統權力，轉移到國際和私人手中。這並不是說美國總統在這一切中毫無角色，而是說他更像是站在幕後的真正權力精英（power elite）的公眾面孔。我想，關於權力運作，我們都已經逐漸理解這一點，而當我們開始對 UFO 保密進行深入分析時，情況很可能也是如此。換句話說，真相揭露的那一刻將會引發一場全球性的思想革命，關乎地球權力結構的真相。那將是一個世界看清並承認皇帝根本沒有穿衣服的時刻。政治後果將是巨大的，而在真相揭露的第一年內，一場激烈的鬥爭就會展開。請這樣想。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "power elite 譯為「權力精英」；emperor has been wearing nothing at all 引用「國王的新衣」典故"}

56. way. Just because the president has been forced into making an announcement doesn't mean that the CIA and all the other intelligence groups that have been managing this will simply walk away. There has been a concerted effort spanning an entire human lifetime to control this topic. A great deal has been invested and mere disclosure is not going to change that. The real issue in the immediate post-disclosure world will be who controls the spin on the story, because right away there will be a great divide, a chasm. Once this topic is available for open discussion, you can be sure that people around the world will be demanding answers. You can be just as sure that on the other side of the fence information will be handed out as sparingly as possible. Government spin doctors will be out in great numbers trying to control the situation according to national security policy, although this
→ {"text": "請這樣想：僅僅因為總統被迫發表聲明，並不意味著 CIA 和所有其他一直在管理此事的情報機構就會輕易退出。為了控制這個議題，已經付出了持續整整一代人壽命的協同努力。大量的資源已經投入，僅僅的真相揭露並不會改變這一點。在真相揭露後的立即世界中，真正的問題將是誰能控制這個故事的論述導向（spin），因為馬上就會出現巨大的分歧，一道鴻溝。一旦這個議題可以公開討論，你可以確定世界各地的人們將會要求答案。你也可以同樣確定，在圍牆的另一邊，資訊將會被盡可能地節省發放。政府的公關操盤手（spin doctors）將會大量出動，試圖按照國家安全政策控制局勢，儘管這一次", "confidence": "high", "notes": "spin 譯為「論述導向」或「詮釋角度」；spin doctors 譯為「公關操盤手」；chasm 譯為「鴻溝」"}

57. time independent UFO searchers may get a public hearing that they hadn't gotten before. If the official spokespersons are making misleading or false statements, it's going to be a bit easier post-disclosure for independent researchers to point this out, because this time the world will be much more likely to listen. And there will be many, many more investigators into this topic after disclosure than there are today. How all that will turn out, only time will tell. There are so many other messy issues relating to global finance, energy, truth commissions, lawsuits, cultural transformations, cultural wars, religious and spiritual changes, scientific paradigm shifts, and ultimately geopolitical changes that will allow us to meet the challenge of, shall we call them others, here on planet Earth in some sort of coordinated, hopefully logical manner, and even more hopefully in some way that answers
→ {"text": "這一次獨立的 UFO 研究者可能會獲得他們以前從未有過的公開聽證機會。如果官方發言人發表誤導性或虛假的聲明，在真相揭露後，獨立研究者要指出這一點會容易一些，因為這一次世界將更願意傾聽。而且真相揭露後，研究這個議題的人將會比今天多得多。這一切將如何發展，只有時間能告訴我們。還有許多其他棘手的問題，涉及全球金融、能源、真相調查委員會、訴訟、文化轉型、文化戰爭、宗教與靈性變革、科學典範轉移，以及最終的地緣政治變化，這些將使我們能夠以某種協調的、希望是合乎邏輯的方式，在地球上應對這些——我們該稱他們為「他者」嗎？——的挑戰，更希望是以某種能回應", "confidence": "high", "notes": "truth commissions 譯為「真相調查委員會」；paradigm shifts 譯為「典範轉移」"}

58. to the people rather than a handful of elite human players. And for that, we will need a groundswell of public pressure from below and tremendous political energy, ethics, and courage to take on the black budget culture that has dominated this subject for so long and to begin a long, hard fight to reclaim some measure of freedom and dignity for humanity while we begin a new, better, and more mature phase of our existence. Thank you.
