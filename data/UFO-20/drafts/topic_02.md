## Speaker Group 8

11. We would give you 20 minutes, sir. >> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. My name, as I said, was Paul Hellyer. I'm a former Minister of National Defence for Canada. I served in three governments during a total of 23 and a half years as a member of Parliament. Although as Minister of National Defence, I had sighting reports of UFOs. I was too busy to be concerned about them at the time because I was trying to unify the Army, Navy and Air Force into a single Canadian Defence Force, and that itself was a kind of battle to the finish. So this was not high on my agenda. But about 10 years ago, I started getting interested due to a young man from Ottawa sending me material on the subject. I told him I was too busy to read it, but he had confidence that someday I would. He sent me a copy of Colonel Corso's book, The

12. Day After Roswell. It took me a while to get around to reading it, but I took it for my summer reading in 2005 and was really impressed with what was contained in it. And what I thought to myself is there are huge issues here, huge issues, and the American people and the people of the world have a right to know what's going on because they're part of it. It's not just an isolated thing. And so after confirming the contents of the book with a retired United States Air Force General, I accepted the invitation of Victor Vigiani, who's over here somewhere, and his cohort, Mike Bird, to speak to a symposium at the University of Toronto. And I said, UFOs are as real as the airplanes flying overhead.
→ {"text": "《羅斯威爾之後的日子》（The Day After Roswell）。我花了些時間才開始讀這本書，但我在2005年暑假讀了它，書中的內容讓我印象深刻。我心想，這裡面涉及巨大的議題，美國人民和全世界人民都有權知道發生了什麼事，因為他們也是其中的一部分。這不僅僅是孤立的事件。在與一位美國空軍（United States Air Force）退役將軍確認書中內容屬實後，我接受了維克多·維吉安尼（Victor Vigiani），他應該也在這裡某處，以及他的夥伴邁克·伯德（Mike Bird）的邀請，在多倫多大學的一場研討會上發表演說。我當時說：UFO就像頭頂上飛過的飛機一樣真實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. That gave me the dubious distinction of being the first person of cabinet rank in the G8 group of countries to say so unequivocally. Since then, I've learned a lot from many sources, including a number of the fantastic witnesses that we have heard these last four days. So they're so outstanding. I was just really blown away with them, the amount of information that was available. And I appreciate every single one of them. But because I'm not a ufologist, I'm a politician, there are only a few things that I want to add in that particular realm. The first is that about in the 1960s sometime, there was a flotilla of UFOs headed south that crossed into NATO territory in Europe. And the commander-in-chief of the Supreme Allied Headquarters in Europe was naturally very shaken. Fortunately, or maybe divine providence before the panic button was pushed, the flotilla turned around and
→ {"text": "這讓我成為了八國集團（G8）國家中第一位如此明確表態的內閣級官員，這個頭銜頗為尷尬。從那時起，我從許多來源學到了很多，包括我們過去四天聽到的幾位傑出證人。他們的證詞非常出色，讓我大為震驚，信息量非常豐富。我非常感謝每一位證人。但因為我不是UFO學家，我是政治家，所以在這個領域我只想補充幾點。首先是關於1960年代左右，有一支UFO艦隊向南飛行，進入了北約（NATO）在歐洲的領空。歐洲盟軍最高司令部（Supreme Allied Headquarters）的總司令自然非常震驚。幸運的是，或者說是天意，在按下恐慌按鈕之前，這支艦隊轉向返回了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. headed back north. Obviously, they had thought maybe they were Russian and they were very concerned about it. Anyway, an investigation was launched into this whole subject. And a document was prepared which concluded that at least four species had been visiting Earth for thousands of years. And this is my own view at this stage as well. So except for that, there are just a couple of things that we've talked about that I'd like to refer to. And one was that we were referring to them as they until this morning when Linda Bolton Howe, I think she was the first one, actually named three different species. I have brought my latest book called Light at the End of the Tunnel, the Survival Plan for the Human Species as an aide-memoire. And I named five different species here. I'm aware of more now. As a matter of fact, I saw a document just a few days ago that mentioned

15. 20. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman. We're interested in some of the places they might come from.

16. So I have in here Zeta Reticuli, the Pleiades, Orion, and Romita, and the Altair star systems.

17. So I don't think we can any more refer them to them as they because they're not an amorphous mass. They are different species and consequently may have different agendas. I don't think we can say that they all have the same agenda any more than that we could say that the United States, China, and Russia had the same agenda. Our real interests may be very similar, but as of now our perceived interests are still quite far apart. One more observation before I begin what I want to say, and that is that we spent quite a bit of time talking about the 66 year old cadavers. And I was glad to have Linda this morning finally say that there are live ETs on earth at this present time, and at least two of them probably working with the United States government. The seventh, the other species that I learned about not too long ago was called the tall whites. And this is when Paula Harris broke the story
→ {"text": "所以我認為我們不能再籠統地稱他們為「他們」，因為他們並不是一個無定形的群體。他們是不同的物種，因此可能有不同的議程。我們不能說他們都有相同的議程，就像我們不能說美國、中國和俄羅斯有相同的議程一樣。我們的真正利益可能非常相似，但就目前而言，我們所認知的利益仍然相去甚遠。在我開始發言之前，還有一個觀察，那就是我們花了不少時間談論那些66年歷史的屍體。我很高興今天早上琳達終於說，目前地球上有活著的外星人（ETs），其中至少有兩個可能正在與美國政府合作。第七個，也就是我不久前才知道的另一個物種，被稱為「白種人」（the tall whites）。這是寶拉·哈里斯（Paula Harris）幾年前披露的消息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. just a few years ago. And through her good offices I had the chance to talk for about three hours with former Airman Charles Hall and listen to this absolutely fascinating story of how he was working. First of all he was scared out of his skin, but after that when he got to know them how he was working with and finally they became to trust each other and have a good working relationship with the tall whites at the gunnery range at Indian Springs in Nevada. And these tall whites were living on United States Air Force property and working in cooperation with the United States Air Force and sharing technology with them. He wrote a book incidentally called Millennial Hospitality. There are four different versions but Paula says that Millennial Hospitality number two is the best. I think that's the one I read and it's a very interesting read if you want to sort of get inside the problem
→ {"text": "就在幾年前。通過她的協助，我有機會與前空軍士兵查爾斯·霍爾（Charles Hall）談了約三個小時，聽他講述那段絕對迷人的經歷。起初他嚇壞了，但後來當他認識他們之後，他學會了如何與他們合作，最終他們建立了互信，並在內華達州印第安泉（Indian Springs）的射擊場與「白種人」建立了良好的工作關係。這些「白種人」住在美國空軍（United States Air Force）的基地裡，與美國空軍合作並分享技術。順帶一提，他寫了一本書叫《千禧年款待》（Millennial Hospitality）。共有四個不同的版本，但寶拉說第二本最好。我想我讀的就是那本，如果你想了解那個問題的內幕，這是一本非常有趣的讀物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. Enough on that for now, my interest is in full disclosure. And I just, my only caveat is I think probably I would say 95 to 98 percent full disclosure. I know of one or two things that I'm not sure should be in the public domain at least yet. They will be someday I'm sure but not maybe immediately. But just as children survive the idea of the tooth fairy and Santa Claus when they become adult, I think that taxpaying citizens are quite capable of accepting the new and broader reality that we live in a cosmos teeming with life of various sorts. The fact that some other civilizations are more advanced than we are may be humbling but that could be a necessary step in our survival. The world is an unholy mess. We have it best until the end of this decade. In my book I said we have ten years to stop global warming if we don't want it to be beyond the point of no return. Two years

21. has gone past since it was written so I say we have until the end of the decade to arrest global warming. Yet our leaders don't even talk about it very much except in a superficial way. They appear to be more interested in starting wars to control more oil and in effect prolong the gravity of the threat. Of course even if they took the problem seriously they wouldn't have the finances to finance the transition from oil to the clean economy to the clean energy because we have an infinitely silly banking and financial system in the western world. And the United States Congress I regret to say is partly responsible and I'd be glad to elaborate on that later if you're interested. And finally they need the technology for clean energy and it exists and it's being kept secret by the same vested interests who control our destiny. Who are these vested interests and what are they up

22. to? Well, Senator, we're talking about a military junta. In my opinion that is true but I have broadened and deepened the definition to cabal and the cabal comprises members of the three sisters. The Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers and the Trilateral Commission, the International Banking Cartel, the Oil Cartel, members of various intelligence organizations and select members of the military unit who together have become a shadow government of not only the United States but of much of the western world. The Council on Foreign Relations is the oldest of the three sisters and as early as October 1940, years before Germany surrendered to the allied armies to vaporize Hitler's vision of empire, the Council's economic and financial group drafted a memorandum outlining a comprehensive policy "to set forth the political, military, territorial and economic requirements of the United States in its political

The Council made no effort to disguise the fact that the purpose of the Grand Area and later world hegemony was to support an expanding U.S. economy, to provide it with raw materials and markets for its products. This was labeled the "national interest." It was equally clear that the national interest was the interest of the ruling elite whose members comprised the Council. The real interests of the majority of rank-and-file Americans was never a factor in the equation.

We blew the chance of a lifetime to do good things. A small group of zealots undermined our golden opportunity to pursue peace, not war, and little did we dream that they had a vastly different vision of the new world order. Their plan, which is now commonly known as the Project for a New American Century, included preventive wars and clear violation of international law, regime change wherever and whenever the U.S. desires and if they can get away with it without excessive casualties, and the establishment of a kind of economic and cultural hegemony with America acting as "constabulary."

And the mere attempt to pursue the impossible pits neighbor against neighbor and the state power structure against everyone. All of the freedoms won by the millions of men and women who fought and died in World War II are being flushed unceremoniously down the drain. The only hope of peace is a negotiated settlement.

Quote, "Although the aliens are not themselves gods, their behavior is sometimes anything but godlike. Abductees consistently report that the beings seem closer to the godhead than we are, acting as messengers, guardian spirits or angels, intermediaries between us and the divine source." Thank you.
