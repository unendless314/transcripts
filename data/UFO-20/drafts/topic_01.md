9. Would you like to read this? >> Well, no. Dr. Bookman, I'd have you read that letter. >> There's not just one letter that the committee created. We also have all six members who have signed this because it does not deal with a foreign government. It deals with the Veterans Affairs Administration and is also addressed to the President of the United States. We're all six members of this committee, and I won't take the time to read it. You're welcome to come up later. Basically demand that Jim Penniston and Airman Burroughs be granted their medical records from this government.
→ {"text": "您要宣讀這封信嗎？>> 嗯，不用。布克曼醫師，我想請您宣讀那封信。>> 這不只是委員會起草的一封信。我們六位成員都簽署了這封信，因為這不涉及外國政府，而是與退伍軍人事務管理局（Veterans Affairs Administration）有關，同時也是寫給美國總統的。我們委員會六位成員都簽署了，我不想花時間宣讀全文，歡迎各位稍後過來看。這封信主要是要求政府將吉姆·佩尼斯頓（Jim Penniston）和伯勞茲士官（Airman Burroughs）的醫療記錄還給他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. Just a point of personal privilege, if I can just say that beyond the obvious benefits to those two heroic former members of the United States Air Force, the release of those records, the obvious medical benefits are clear, and that's alone enough reason for us to sign that. But the obvious implications of what's on those records in terms of breaking down the wall or putting another crack in that truth embargo are, I think, obvious to people in this room for sure. Let's go to our esteemed Honorable Paul Hellyer of Canada.
→ {"text": "請容我行使個人特權說明一下，除了對那兩位英勇的美國空軍（United States Air Force）退役人員有明顯的幫助之外，釋出那些醫療記錄所帶來的醫療福利也很清楚，單是這一點就足以讓我們簽署這封信。但那些記錄內容在打破那道牆，或者在真相封鎖（truth embargo）上再製造一道裂縫方面的明顯意義，我想在座各位一定都明白。現在有請我們尊貴的加拿大證人保羅·赫勒（Paul Hellyer）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
