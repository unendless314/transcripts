9. Would you like to read this? >> Well, no. Dr. Bookman, I'd have you read that letter. >> There's not just one letter that the committee created. We also have all six members who have signed this because it does not deal with a foreign government. It deals with the Veterans Affairs Administration and is also addressed to the President of the United States. We're all six members of this committee, and I won't take the time to read it. You're welcome to come up later. Basically demand that Jim Penniston and Airman Burroughs be granted their medical records from this government.

But the obvious implications of what's on those records in terms of breaking down the wall or putting another crack in that truth embargo are, I think, obvious to people in this room for sure. Let's go to our esteemed Honorable Paul Hellyer of Canada.
