60. Good afternoon. Again, I point out that I'm speaking in this context as our general counsel here for this gathering and our meeting. And I do this in the context of having served as an attorney, as I pointed out in my initial comments on the first day we gathered, that I have for various reasons ended up being the attorney for a number of different issues having to do with attempting to uncover ongoing cover-ups. From the time that I served as one of the attorneys for the New York Times and the Pentagon Papers case, having seen the 47 volumes of the concealment of a policy that was completely contrary to what was being publicly professed and told to the Congress, in fact. And then I ended up being counsel in the Karen Silkwood case, uncovering the fact that our central intelligence agency was smuggling 98% pure bomb-grade plutonium to Israel, et cetera. I pointed out at the

61. beginning of this conversation this week. And I pointed out that I ended up in the Iran Contra case as being the ones who, one of the ones that brought the information, attempted to bring it to Congress. And I want to point out here just at the very top of my conversation to repeat the reaction on the part of Peter Rodino, who was the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee at the time, when the information concerning the off-the-shelf self-financing covert operations enterprise that had been set up by the chief of covert operations for the central intelligence agency, Theodore Shackley, under George H.W. Bush, that when he was told this by Scott Armstrong, one of his trusted confidants, that Peter Rodino's response was, "My God, my God, Scott, I've been telling people for years that if they didn't like the way that our American policy was going, that they should write a letter
→ {"text": "本週對話的開頭。我還指出，我後來參與了伊朗門事件（Iran Contra case），成為將相關資訊帶給國會的人之一。我想在此首先重複彼得·羅迪諾（Peter Rodino）當時的反應，他當時是眾議院司法委員會（House Judiciary Committee）主席，當他從信任的親信斯科特·阿姆斯特朗（Scott Armstrong）那裡得知，中央情報局（CIA）秘密行動主管西奧多·沙克利（Theodore Shackley）在老布希總統（George H.W. Bush）任內設立了一個「現成自籌資金的秘密行動企業」時，彼得·羅迪諾的反應是：「我的天啊，我的天啊，斯科特，這些年來我一直告訴人們，如果他們不喜歡我們美國政策的走向，他們應該寫信給他們的國會議員。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Iran Contra case 譯為伊朗門事件，Peter Rodino 譯為彼得·羅迪諾，House Judiciary Committee 譯為眾議院司法委員會，Theodore Shackley 譯為西奧多·沙克利，George H.W. Bush 譯為老布希總統"}


62. to their congressperson. But if their congressperson did not respond, they should vote for someone else to be their congressperson. But if what you're telling me here is true, why then we haven't even been in charge? I'm not going to allow the United States Congress to investigate anything like that." Now, that's an absolute quote from Peter Rodino as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. This had only to do with the fact that there was a covert operation going on attempting to supply military equipment to the Contras. Now, what we're dealing with here is we've come full circle during the course of this week. We've discovered that the three major questions that have been in front of us, that being that what in the world is going on here with this phenomenon of so-called unidentified flying objects or the flying saucers themselves when we move beyond the unidentified nature of them, and these beings

63. that seem to be associated with these vehicles that have been seen on a number of occasions.
→ {"text": "這些生物似乎與這些在多次目擊事件中出現的載具有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. That's one of the big major questions. The second major question is, "Well, who in the world is it that knows what the answer to this question is?" Since so many of the government officials don't seem to know, yourselves included, one of the extraordinary events of the week has been watching the transition take place from six of our trusted and long-time representatives actually coming to discover that the information that actually exists about this is extraordinary and very detailed. It addresses the issue of the radar sightings. It addresses the issues of all the questions that have been asked, and it comes to an observation that not only does the Congress not know about this, but many people throughout the executive branch don't know about this. This question of who is it that does know about this, or is there anybody that knows about this? What we have heard over and over again in the testimony
→ {"text": "這是第一個重大問題。第二個重大問題是：「究竟有誰知道這個問題的答案？」既然這麼多政府官員似乎都不知道，包括你們在內，本週最非凡的事件之一就是目睹六位我們信賴且資深的代表，實際上逐漸發現關於此事存在的資訊是極其非凡且非常詳細的。這涉及雷達目擊的問題，涉及所有被提出的問題，並且我們觀察到，不僅國會不知道這些，行政部門的許多人也不知道。這個問題是：究竟有誰知道這些？或者說，有沒有人知道這些？我們在證詞中反覆聽到的是", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. is that there are many pieces of evidence that indicate that this is known about, that there was an agency set up by President Truman shortly after the discovery of the crash site at Roswell in 1947, the Majestic 12 group. There's been clear testimony that I believe is credible, would be credible in a court of law, that this organization has for various reasons taken this issue out from under the oversight of our Congress, out from under the control of our executive branch, and has taken this into a realm of semi-private control.
→ {"text": "有許多證據表明這是有人知道的，那就是杜魯門總統（President Truman）在1947年羅斯威爾事件（Roswell）墜毀現場被發現後不久設立的一個機構，即 MJ-12 組織（Majestic 12 group）。有明確的證詞，我相信是可信的，在法庭上也能被採信，這個組織出於各種原因已將這個議題從我們國會的監督之下、從行政部門的控制之下移出，並將其帶入一個半私人控制的領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "President Truman 譯為杜魯門總統，Roswell 譯為羅斯威爾事件，Majestic 12 group 譯為 MJ-12 組織"}

66. What you'll notice is as we come to the last panel of our week together here, the issue tends to turn more and more to that issue. What has happened to our country when a national security state seems to have arisen to conceal certain types of information from our people, from our congressional representatives, even from some of our presidents. That question seems to be in front of us right now, attempting to understand the nature of this elite group.
→ {"text": "你們會注意到，當我們來到本週最後一個小組討論時，議題越來越傾向於那個問題。當一個國家安全狀態（national security state）似乎已經興起，向我們的人民、向我們的國會代表、甚至向我們的一些總統隱瞞某些類型的資訊時，我們的國家發生了什麼事？這個問題似乎正擺在我們面前，試圖理解這個精英集團的本質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "national security state 首次出現保留原文並加註"}

67. What we want to do also is face the third question, is that when you get past these procedural questions to the ultimate question of who are these beings, what are the implications for our human family if we are, in fact, at a point of some rather dramatic transition.
→ {"text": "我們還想面對第三個問題，那就是當你超越這些程序性問題，來到最終的問題：這些生物是誰？如果我們事實上正處於某種相當劇烈的轉變時刻，這對我們人類大家庭意味著什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. I believe that what we're going to be experiencing in the very near future has been foreshadowed, as I mentioned earlier, by the positions being taken by the Catholic Church and the Vatican, that they are very clearly attempting to move into a position of utilizing the increasing discovery of more and more planets on which they are more and more confident that life is going to be discovered and that they're going to eventually not only recognize that at least microscopic life has been discovered, but that a civilization has been discovered and they're going to begin by pointing out that it's okay because they're very far away.
→ {"text": "我相信我們在不久的將來將要經歷的事情，正如我先前提到的，已經被天主教會和梵蒂岡所採取的立場所預示。他們顯然正試圖進入一種立場，利用越來越多行星的發現，他們越來越確信這些行星上將會發現生命，而且他們最終不僅會承認至少已經發現了微生物生命，而且還發現了一個文明。他們將首先指出這沒有問題，因為他們非常遙遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. We've discovered them, we've found the information, but they're very far away and they're going to engage in a process of feathering this consciousness into our people and that they're only then going to point out that this civilization seems to be a highly developed technological civilization and we will then reveal the existence of communication mechanisms that we have developed whereby we can have a longer range diplomatic type of negotiation with this civilization.

70. They're going to say let's not turn to the past, let's not reflect upon all this information and evidence that's been around for a long time that they seem to be here, we've known about it, there's been concealment about this, there may be concealment of certain technology that they've made, we had available to us, just as was said by the Obama administration, let's not look back at George W. Bush's administration, let's not review the question of the torture and the lying to the Congress of the United States to get us involved in this, let's not do that, let's look forward and be constructive, that's how we're all trained and what I'm saying is that I think we've come to try to share some of that consciousness here this week, what can we do to look forward to this and that's why the resolution has been put forth here to try to reach out and have a set of conferences sponsored by the United

71. Nations General Assembly start to reveal this information so we can participate in this to avoid a dialectical confrontation between the people of our country and this national security state apparatus, some of the details of which have been pointed out here in our final panel and I share in that wish to have this done constructively and peacefully and I believe that we can do that and I believe that you as members, former members of Congress recently retired, the reality is that if the six of you go and sit down with various people in Congress, not to expect that they're going to change overnight and say oh look, let's have a hearing on this and expose it to our people, but the fact that you have come to discover just this week so much more than you ever knew was going on, that you are experts at trying to share this information with people in your regions of the country and we have

What am I going to do now that I have left the Congress? Am I going to continue to represent the people in my district? Am I going to attempt to educate them? Because if you have come to the same conclusion that I came to when I was given the privilege of representing Dr. John Mack, if you've come to the same conclusion that I have, this is one of the most important issues that you've ever encountered in your life and you are the most skilled
