      cabinet rank in the G8 group of countries to say so unequivocally. Since then,
      I've learned a lot from many sources, including a number of the fantastic witnesses
      that we have heard these last four days. So they're so outstanding. I was just
      really blown away with them, the amount of information that was available. And
      I appreciate every single one of them. But because I'm not a ufologist, I'm
      a politician, there are only a few things that I want to add in that particular
      realm. The first is that about in the 1960s sometime, there was a flotilla of
      UFOs headed south that crossed into NATO territory in Europe. And the commander-in-chief
      of the Supreme Allied Headquarters in Europe was naturally very shaken. Fortunately,
      or maybe divine providence before the panic button was pushed, the flotilla
      turned around and

      of the decade to arrest global warming. Yet our leaders don't even talk about
      it very much except in a superficial way. They appear to be more interested
      in starting wars to control more oil and in effect prolong the gravity of the
      threat. Of course even if they took the problem seriously they wouldn't have
      the finances to finance the transition from oil to the clean economy to the
      clean energy because we have an infinitely silly banking and financial system
      in the western world. And the United States Congress I regret to say is partly
      responsible and I'd be glad to elaborate on that later if you're interested.
      And finally they need the technology for clean energy and it exists and it's
      being kept secret by the same vested interests who control our destiny. Who
      are these vested interests and what are they up

      Does this help you to understand why our civil rights are being taken away from
      us? I say us because Canada too is included in the grand plan. A giant leap
      in the wrong direction followed the end of the Cold War. No one could have been
      happier than I was when the Berlin Wall came down on November the 9th, 1989.
      The elation on our side of the curtain was near universal and very significant
      on the other side as one country after another regained its freedom.

    source_text: Okay. In short, American foreign policy was the root of the conflict.
      So here we are more than a decade later fighting another war that can't be won.
      There is no country on earth powerful enough to protect its citizens against
      fanatical hate as we learn from the Boston Marathon. And the mere attempt to
      pursue the impossible pits neighbor against neighbor and the state power structure
      against everyone. All of the freedoms won by the millions of men and women who
      fought and died in World War II are being flushed unceremoniously down the drain.
      The only hope of peace is a negotiated settlement. This will require a paradigm
      shift in American attitudes. It involves a de facto renunciation of the plan
      for a new American century and the adoption of a pledge of cooperation with
      all humankind to build the kind of world which we are collectively capable of.

      as our general counsel here for this gathering and our meeting. And I do this
      in the context of having served as an attorney, as I pointed out in my initial
      comments on the first day we gathered, that I have for various reasons ended
      up being the attorney for a number of different issues having to do with attempting
      to uncover ongoing cover-ups. From the time that I served as one of the attorneys
      for the New York Times and the Pentagon Papers case, having seen the 47 volumes
      of the concealment of a policy that was completely contrary to what was being
      publicly professed and told to the Congress, in fact. And then I ended up being
      counsel in the Karen Silkwood case, uncovering the fact that our central intelligence
      agency was smuggling 98% pure bomb-grade plutonium to Israel, et cetera. I pointed

      I ended up in the Iran Contra case as being the ones who, one of the ones that
      brought the information, attempted to bring it to Congress. And I want to point
      out here just at the very top of my conversation to repeat the reaction on the
      part of Peter Rodino, who was the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
      at the time, when the information concerning the off-the-shelf self-financing
      covert operations enterprise that had been set up by the chief of covert operations
      for the central intelligence agency, Theodore Shackley, under George H.W. Bush,
      that when he was told this by Scott Armstrong, one of his trusted confidants,
      that Peter Rodino's response was, "My God, my God, Scott, I've been telling
      people for years that if they didn't like the way that our American policy was
      going, that they should write a letter

      they should vote for someone else to be their congressperson. But if what you're
      telling me here is true, why then we haven't even been in charge? I'm not going
      to allow the United States Congress to investigate anything like that." Now,
      that's an absolute quote from Peter Rodino as the chairman of the Judiciary
      Committee. This had only to do with the fact that there was a covert operation
      going on attempting to supply military equipment to the Contras. Now, what we're
      dealing with here is we've come full circle during the course of this week.
      We've discovered that the three major questions that have been in front of us,
      that being that what in the world is going on here with this phenomenon of so-called
      unidentified flying objects or the flying saucers themselves when we move beyond
      the unidentified nature of them, and these beings

      taken by the Catholic Church and the Vatican, that they are very clearly attempting
      to move into a position of utilizing the increasing discovery of more and more
      planets on which they are more and more confident that life is going to be discovered
      and that they're going to eventually not only recognize that at least microscopic
      life has been discovered, but that a civilization has been discovered and they're
      going to begin by pointing out that it's okay because they're very far away.

      administration, who similarly told of being taken for several weeks after he
      got his job to an underground facility to receive a briefing and was deeply
      upset because, as he said to a trusted family member, I have a daughter and
      I am terrified for her. So there is something going on in which this phenomenon

      concern that I think they must have had that was fairly recent in their memory.
      Another concern would be, gee, there really is some advanced technology here,
      isn't there? And wouldn't it be tragic if the Soviets had that rather than us
      or shared it with us? And so I think for these two reasons they could very well
      have rationalized it. And that decision was made very early. Apparently it may
      have gone clear to the office of the president because within a few hours after
      they issued that press release that said that a flying saucer had crashed, they
      came with this ridiculous press release saying, gee, it was just a balloon.

      I can't, when I contemplated coming here to Washington for this, I certainly

      Sir, you're a hero to me. Your commitment to our Constitution and the principles
      of liberty that it embodies, and yes, Senator Gravel's right, it never embodied
      them perfectly, but it was a huge advance in the history of humanity on this
      planet to grant liberty to the people, to see the government not as the giver
      of rights, but as of rights being self-evident and inalienable, inalienable
      for each individual.

      effect, transformed by it. And how I wish that more people would be in that
      position so that we could really get the word out and get the kind of action
      that we dream of. But as the Senator says, it may be just a dream, but I hope
      not, because time is running out. So thank you very much, every one of you.
      You are great, and we appreciate what you have done. And just hope, Mr. Chairman,

      of what's on those records in terms of breaking down the wall or putting another

    source_text: We would give you 20 minutes, sir. >> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair,
      and thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. My name, as I said, was
      Paul Hellyer. I'm a former Minister of National Defence for Canada. I served
      in three governments during a total of 23 and a half years as a member of Parliament.
      Although as Minister of National Defence, I had sighting reports of UFOs. I
      was too busy to be concerned about them at the time because I was trying to
      unify the Army, Navy and Air Force into a single Canadian Defence Force, and
      that itself was a kind of battle to the finish. So this was not high on my agenda.
      But about 10 years ago, I started getting interested due to a young man from
      Ottawa sending me material on the subject. I told him I was too busy to read
      it, but he had confidence that someday I would. He sent me a copy of Colonel
      Corso's book, The

      I've learned a lot from many sources, including a number of the fantastic witnesses
      that we have heard these last four days. So they're so outstanding. I was just
      really blown away with them, the amount of information that was available. And
      I appreciate every single one of them. But because I'm not a ufologist, I'm
      a politician, there are only a few things that I want to add in that particular
      realm. The first is that about in the 1960s sometime, there was a flotilla of
      UFOs headed south that crossed into NATO territory in Europe. And the commander-in-chief
      of the Supreme Allied Headquarters in Europe was naturally very shaken. Fortunately,
      or maybe divine providence before the panic button was pushed, the flotilla
      turned around and

      and they were very concerned about it. Anyway, an investigation was launched
      into this whole subject. And a document was prepared which concluded that at
      least four species had been visiting Earth for thousands of years. And this
      is my own view at this stage as well. So except for that, there are just a couple
      of things that we've talked about that I'd like to refer to. And one was that
      we were referring to them as they until this morning when Linda Bolton Howe,
      I think she was the first one, actually named three different species. I have
      brought my latest book called Light at the End of the Tunnel, the Survival Plan
      for the Human Species as an aide-memoire. And I named five different species
      here. I'm aware of more now. As a matter of fact, I saw a document just a few

      they're not an amorphous mass. They are different species and consequently may
      have different agendas. I don't think we can say that they all have the same
      agenda any more than that we could say that the United States, China, and Russia
      had the same agenda. Our real interests may be very similar, but as of now our
      perceived interests are still quite far apart. One more observation before I
      begin what I want to say, and that is that we spent quite a bit of time talking
      about the 66 year old cadavers. And I was glad to have Linda this morning finally
      say that there are live ETs on earth at this present time, and at least two
      of them probably working with the United States government. The seventh, the
      other species that I learned about not too long ago was called the tall whites.

      have rationalized it. And that decision was made very early. Apparently it may
      have gone clear to the office of the president because within a few hours after
      they issued that press release that said that a flying saucer had crashed, they
      came with this ridiculous press release saying, gee, it was just a balloon.
      We goofed. But they did send what they found to Wright Field and they did send

      by saying to all of the witnesses and each and every one witness, if you're
      a researcher, you keep on researching and redouble those research efforts. If
      you're someone in the media that's trying to understand this and help promote
      it, work harder at it. And if, I mean, you're doing a good job, don't get me
      wrong, but I just want you to redouble this. Because, you know, if it's true,
      I've announced before I even came here that I believe in extraterrestrial life.
      And that was from a religious standpoint. So I've been focusing on scientific
      evidence of it. And let me just say this. I'm like, sorry the name slips through
      me, but the person that used to be the minister of, or in the Ministry of Defense,
      Nick Pope. I'm like Nick Pope. I haven't come to a definite scientific conclusion

      Hooley's seat when she left earlier today. I'd like to echo what Congressman
      Cook said about the heroic actions of the witnesses who came here this week.
      And what Congressman Bartlett said about those brilliant stars under that winter
      night in West Virginia. But what I'm here to suggest is that we have stars who've
      shone just as brightly this week and other human beings who are here who were

      to be first. Senator Gravel, when I called him, said, "Do you mind if I quote
      you on this and share a private phone call for a bit, Senator, in the world

      have done, which is to be heroic, to stand up and recognize an allegiance, if
      not to the Constitution, then to your fellow men on this planet, men and women
      on the planet, to share what you know to be true about this issue. Congressman
      Bartlett has been commuting two and a half hours every morning to be here, two
      and a half hours back to his farm in Virginia. He's 86 years old. [applause]
      Sir, you're a hero to me. Your commitment to our Constitution and the principles
      of liberty that it embodies, and yes, Senator Gravel's right, it never embodied
      them perfectly, but it was a huge advance in the history of humanity on this
      planet to grant liberty to the people, to see the government not as the giver
      of rights, but as of rights being self-evident and inalienable, inalienable
      for each individual.

      Thank you very much, those of you who organized this. I've really been privileged
      to be here. I'm honored that you invited me to come. And thank you to the witnesses.
      And I think back through these five days and the witnesses have come, some of
      them at considerable personal price. And a special thanks to those who have
      borne this secret for 40, 50 years, and now near their deathbed, come forward
      so that we can know. I ask myself why this cloak of secrecy? Clearly there is
      a cloak of secrecy. And I ask myself why. My wife says that I'm the eternal
      optimist. And I'd like to think the best of everybody until proven different.
      And so I want to believe that those who made decisions were patriotic Americans,
      believing that at the time they made the decision which was in the best interest
      of their country. This was just a few years

      this affect my religion, my belief in God?" Well, I believe in the intelligent
      design. Because if in the very beginning at the Big Bang, when things were created,
      if the parameters were changed just ever so slightly, like the rate of expansion
      of the universe, or the charge on the proton, or the electron, or the masses
      thereof, had that been off by 1 trillion from what it turned out to be, we wouldn't
      be here, nor would our cousins from outer space be here too.

      something called quantum entanglement that occurred. And Einstein calls this
      spooky action at a distance, but that means that all particles created in the
      Big Bang are related to each other. One example is where they would take two
      matched particles, send one of them, could be light years away, but you'd make
      one change and one, the other one changes correspondingly instantly. Like there's
      faster than light communication.

      said that to repeat over and over again something that doesn't work is the definition

      We vote for Republicans, nothing really happens. We go to Britain, we see one
      government, that government, nothing really happens to advance the needs of
      the human race. You can only come to one conclusion that the answer is not with
      the elites. They manipulate our elections. Mind you, I raise money from special
