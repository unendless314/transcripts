    obvious benefits to those two heroic former members of the United States Air Force,
    the release of those records, the obvious medical benefits are clear, and that's
    alone enough reason for us to sign that. But the obvious implications of what's
    on those records in terms of breaking down the wall or putting another crack in
    that truth embargo are, I think, obvious to people in this room for sure. Let's
    go to our esteemed Honorable Paul Hellyer of Canada.

    and thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. My name, as I said, was
    Paul Hellyer. I'm a former Minister of National Defence for Canada. I served in
    three governments during a total of 23 and a half years as a member of Parliament.
    Although as Minister of National Defence, I had sighting reports of UFOs. I was
    too busy to be concerned about them at the time because I was trying to unify
    the Army, Navy and Air Force into a single Canadian Defence Force, and that itself
    was a kind of battle to the finish. So this was not high on my agenda. But about
    10 years ago, I started getting interested due to a young man from Ottawa sending
    me material on the subject. I told him I was too busy to read it, but he had confidence
    that someday I would. He sent me a copy of Colonel Corso's book, The

    text: 我們給您20分鐘的時間，先生。>> 非常感謝主席，也感謝您給我這個發言的機會。如我所說，我叫保羅·赫勒（Paul Hellyer），是加拿大前國防部長（Minister
      of National Defence for Canada）。我在三屆政府中擔任國會議員，總共服務了23年半。雖然身為國防部長時，我確實收到過UFO目擊報告，但那時我太忙了，無暇顧及這些事情，因為我正忙於將陸軍、海軍和空軍統一整合為單一的加拿大國防部隊（Canadian
      Defence Force），這本身就是一場艱苦的戰鬥。所以這件事並不在我的優先議程上。但大約10年前，我開始對這個議題產生興趣，原因是一位來自渥太華的年輕人寄給我相關資料。我告訴他我太忙了沒時間讀，但他有信心總有一天我會讀的。他寄給我一本科索上校（Colonel
      Corso）的書，書名是《羅斯威爾之後的日子》（The Day After Roswell）。

  source_text: Day After Roswell. It took me a while to get around to reading it,
    but I took it for my summer reading in 2005 and was really impressed with what
    was contained in it. And what I thought to myself is there are huge issues here,
    huge issues, and the American people and the people of the world have a right
    to know what's going on because they're part of it. It's not just an isolated
    thing. And so after confirming the contents of the book with a retired United
    States Air Force General, I accepted the invitation of Victor Vigiani, who's over
    here somewhere, and his cohort, Mike Bird, to speak to a symposium at the University
    of Toronto. And I said, UFOs are as real as the airplanes flying overhead.
  translation:
    text: 《羅斯威爾之後的日子》（The Day After Roswell）。我花了些時間才開始讀這本書，但我在2005年暑假讀了它，書中的內容讓我印象深刻。我心想，這裡面涉及巨大的議題，美國人民和全世界人民都有權知道發生了什麼事，因為他們也是其中的一部分。這不僅僅是孤立的事件。在與一位美國空軍（United
      States Air Force）退役將軍確認書中內容屬實後，我接受了維克多·維吉安尼（Victor Vigiani），他應該也在這裡某處，以及他的夥伴邁克·伯德（Mike
      Bird）的邀請，在多倫多大學的一場研討會上發表演說。我當時說：UFO就像頭頂上飛過的飛機一樣真實。

  source_text: That gave me the dubious distinction of being the first person of cabinet
    rank in the G8 group of countries to say so unequivocally. Since then, I've learned
    a lot from many sources, including a number of the fantastic witnesses that we
    have heard these last four days. So they're so outstanding. I was just really
    blown away with them, the amount of information that was available. And I appreciate
    every single one of them. But because I'm not a ufologist, I'm a politician, there
    are only a few things that I want to add in that particular realm. The first is
    that about in the 1960s sometime, there was a flotilla of UFOs headed south that
    crossed into NATO territory in Europe. And the commander-in-chief of the Supreme
    Allied Headquarters in Europe was naturally very shaken. Fortunately, or maybe
    divine providence before the panic button was pushed, the flotilla turned around
    and

      Allied Headquarters）的總司令自然非常震驚。幸運的是，或者說是天意，在按下恐慌按鈕之前，這支艦隊轉向返回了。

    and they were very concerned about it. Anyway, an investigation was launched into
    this whole subject. And a document was prepared which concluded that at least
    four species had been visiting Earth for thousands of years. And this is my own
    view at this stage as well. So except for that, there are just a couple of things
    that we've talked about that I'd like to refer to. And one was that we were referring
    to them as they until this morning when Linda Bolton Howe, I think she was the
    first one, actually named three different species. I have brought my latest book
    called Light at the End of the Tunnel, the Survival Plan for the Human Species
    as an aide-memoire. And I named five different species here. I'm aware of more
    now. As a matter of fact, I saw a document just a few days ago that mentioned

      Bolton Howe），我想她是第一個，實際上點出了三個不同的物種。我帶來了我的新書《隧道盡頭的光》（Light at the End of the

    they're not an amorphous mass. They are different species and consequently may
    have different agendas. I don't think we can say that they all have the same agenda
    any more than that we could say that the United States, China, and Russia had
    the same agenda. Our real interests may be very similar, but as of now our perceived
    interests are still quite far apart. One more observation before I begin what
    I want to say, and that is that we spent quite a bit of time talking about the
    66 year old cadavers. And I was glad to have Linda this morning finally say that
    there are live ETs on earth at this present time, and at least two of them probably
    working with the United States government. The seventh, the other species that
    I learned about not too long ago was called the tall whites. And this is when
    Paula Harris broke the story

  source_text: just a few years ago. And through her good offices I had the chance
    to talk for about three hours with former Airman Charles Hall and listen to this
    absolutely fascinating story of how he was working. First of all he was scared
    out of his skin, but after that when he got to know them how he was working with
    and finally they became to trust each other and have a good working relationship
    with the tall whites at the gunnery range at Indian Springs in Nevada. And these
    tall whites were living on United States Air Force property and working in cooperation
    with the United States Air Force and sharing technology with them. He wrote a
    book incidentally called Millennial Hospitality. There are four different versions
    but Paula says that Millennial Hospitality number two is the best. I think that's
    the one I read and it's a very interesting read if you want to sort of get inside

      Springs）的射擊場與「白種人」建立了良好的工作關係。這些「白種人」住在美國空軍（United States Air Force）的基地裡，與美國空軍合作並分享技術。順帶一提，他寫了一本書叫《千禧年款待》（Millennial

    my only caveat is I think probably I would say 95 to 98 percent full disclosure.
    I know of one or two things that I'm not sure should be in the public domain at
    least yet. They will be someday I'm sure but not maybe immediately. But just as
    children survive the idea of the tooth fairy and Santa Claus when they become
    adult, I think that taxpaying citizens are quite capable of accepting the new
    and broader reality that we live in a cosmos teeming with life of various sorts.
    The fact that some other civilizations are more advanced than we are may be humbling
    but that could be a necessary step in our survival. The world is an unholy mess.
    We have it best until the end of this decade. In my book I said we have ten years
    to stop global warming if we don't want it to be beyond the point of no return.

    even if they took the problem seriously they wouldn't have the finances to finance
    the transition from oil to the clean economy to the clean energy because we have
    an infinitely silly banking and financial system in the western world. And the
    United States Congress I regret to say is partly responsible and I'd be glad to

    hate as we learn from the Boston Marathon. And the mere attempt to pursue the
    impossible pits neighbor against neighbor and the state power structure against
    everyone. All of the freedoms won by the millions of men and women who fought
    and died in World War II are being flushed unceremoniously down the drain. The
    only hope of peace is a negotiated settlement. This will require a paradigm shift
    in American attitudes. It involves a de facto renunciation of the plan for a new
    American century and the adoption of a pledge of cooperation with all humankind
    to build the kind of world which we are collectively capable of.

      for a New American Century），並採取與全人類合作的承諾，建立一個我們集體有能力建立的世界。

    if you'll allow me, Mr. Chair. This is from the late Dr. John Mack, an American
    secular Jewish psychiatrist who became a world leader in interviewing abductees
    or experiencers, as he called them, came to this conclusion in a startling book,
    Passport to the Cosmos. Quote, "Although the aliens are not themselves gods, their
    behavior is sometimes anything but godlike. Abductees consistently report that
    the beings seem closer to the godhead than we are, acting as messengers, guardian
    spirits or angels, intermediaries between us and the divine source." Thank you.

      to the Cosmos）中得出了這個結論。我引用：「雖然外星人本身不是神，但他們的行為有時絕非神性。被綁架者始終報告說，這些生物似乎比我們更接近神性，充當使者、守護靈或天使，是我們與神聖源頭之間的中介。」謝謝。

    of UFOs and ETs, possible extraterrestrials, is a paradox. It's impossible, but
    it is inevitable. It's impossible because there is no political motivation for
    it. It's inevitable, however, because our leaders are not the only factor in this
    equation. There are other beings, after all, but mainly I would say there is us,
    the people, who are going through this greatest social, cultural, and especially
    technological transformation in the history of humanity. In fact, I would say
    that we are the game changers.

    I think Mr. Heller answered it for us. It's the three sisters. I mean, they know
    of the industrial complexes, the oil cabal, the banking cabal. They know. They've
    been controlling this for a long time. We know they know, and we know they've
    been controlling it, so our question is now, what do we do about it? I don't think
    it does a lot of good to go out and insult the people that are going to have to
    do something about it, but we can do more than we're doing. We have to get money
    out of politics, one. I don't mean control the press, what they can see. We have
    to expand the press so that three or five corporations don't own the communications
    in our country.

    me if I was interested in this and warned me that there was a big probability
    that a lot of people would relegate me to the lunatic fringe for coming here.
    I told her that the primary reason that I would come was that there's a serious
    constitutional issue here. The citizens have a right for their government to tell
    them what's going on here. And I want to thank both of you for bringing up this
    constitutional issue because I think it is a very serious one. A government which
    ignores the constitution to do good things today, what they think are good things
    today, can ignore the constitution to do bad things tomorrow because it will rationalize
    that they are good things tomorrow. So thank you very much for your shared concern

    So I think, you know, there are some big problems. But I think Congress ultimately
    has the key to both the future of the United States and of the world. And this
    is what bothers me because they're not exercising their power to change the things
    that have to be changed. But if you'll indulge me, I'd like to read two pages
    from advice from the extraterrestrials. And I think they've got a lot of good
    advice because they know what's going on more than we do sometimes. This is a
    quote from Jim Sparks, who was probably the most abducted of all the people who
    have been abducted. And he was taken away one night late on. He'd been abducted
    dozens of times

    It's the ability to make laws that stand outside of ourselves and that we're supposed
    to obey them. At this point in time, only representatives make laws, and these
    representatives de facto are controlled by these forces beyond our control because
    they control society. The answer is to find a way to empower people to be able

    when they thought we were being invaded by extraterrestrials. And that was one
    concern that I think they must have had that was fairly recent in their memory.
    Another concern would be, gee, there really is some advanced technology here,
    isn't there? And wouldn't it be tragic if the Soviets had that rather than us
    or shared it with us? And so I think for these two reasons they could very well
    have rationalized it. And that decision was made very early. Apparently it may
    have gone clear to the office of the president because within a few hours after
    they issued that press release that said that a flying saucer had crashed, they
    came with this ridiculous press release saying, gee, it was just a balloon. We

    have done, which is to be heroic, to stand up and recognize an allegiance, if
    not to the Constitution, then to your fellow men on this planet, men and women
    on the planet, to share what you know to be true about this issue. Congressman
    Bartlett has been commuting two and a half hours every morning to be here, two
    and a half hours back to his farm in Virginia. He's 86 years old. [applause] Sir,
    you're a hero to me. Your commitment to our Constitution and the principles of
    liberty that it embodies, and yes, Senator Gravel's right, it never embodied them
    perfectly, but it was a huge advance in the history of humanity on this planet
    to grant liberty to the people, to see the government not as the giver of rights,
    but as of rights being self-evident and inalienable, inalienable for each individual.

    called quantum entanglement that occurred. And Einstein calls this spooky action
    at a distance, but that means that all particles created in the Big Bang are related
    to each other. One example is where they would take two matched particles, send
    one of them, could be light years away, but you'd make one change and one, the
    other one changes correspondingly instantly. Like there's faster than light communication.
