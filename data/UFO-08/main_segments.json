point."},{"segment_id":35,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That is one reason for keeping it secret."},{"segment_id":36,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The other one is they wouldn't want the public

great detail how our missiles operate."},{"segment_id":53,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They know ours, but we don't know theirs."},{"segment_id":54,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's right."},{"segment_id":55,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They can shut down our missiles at any time."},{"segment_id":56,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They have proven that."},{"segment_id":57,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They know in great detail how they operate."},{"segment_id":58,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so if you release that information to

shut our missiles down until we put EMF filters on our missiles in the early '70s, and by '76, they couldn't shut them down, because in my opinion of the EMF filters and some of the documentation that Robert Salas got unsealed, I looked at and found, in fact, in '68, after studying his shutdowns, they were looking at EMF as a problem."},{"segment_id":63,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I do distinctly remember our missiles being pulled offline one at a time before our incident happened and asked one of the members of the security maintenance teams, and they let it out of the bag that it was an EMF filter, and then they got shushed for it."},{"segment_id":64,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I also accompanied a nuclear warhead or crew duty."},{"segment_id":65,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Additional duty would be to do that on a convoy where we took a nuclear warhead out to a missile site to be replaced, to swap it out."},{"segment_id":66,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So in my opinion, the EMF filters caused a problem to these entities until they worked around that by the time in 2010."},{"segment_id":67,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't want to disagree with Mr. Fenstermacher, but I would like to point out that about the incident that I just mentioned in 2010, the jury's still out as to whether or not that was a UFO incident where 50 nuclear missiles were shut down while objects were seen overhead."},{"segment_id":68,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I certainly agree that after our incident in the early days, electromagnetic pulse or electromagnetic force was considered a possible cause for the shutdowns, and the Air Force did have an active program to improve the EMP protection."},{"segment_id":69,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Mr. Dolan?"},{"segment_id":70,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":71,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think the answers of technology and panic are probably top of the list."},{"segment_id":72,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Certainly if even one artifact of a UFO were ever recovered, and those who've studied this matter in detail most believe that that is the case, one can easily see why that would be of paramount interest to keep from other parties that you don't want to have that technology."},{"segment_id":73,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So the only way to do that for sure is to deny that there's a phenomenon that exists whatsoever."},{"segment_id":74,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But we actually know from the declassified literature that even as early as 1947, there were wind tunnel tests of disk-shaped airframes that were being conducted at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, and these were explicitly based on UFO sightings."},{"segment_id":75,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have a document from October 1947 authored by Colonel Wentworth, I believe, in which he references this."},{"segment_id":76,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So the obvious connection between UFO sightings alone and technological development is right there from the beginning."},{"segment_id":77,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the idea of panic is the worst, because what we find in many cases is that panic can escalate very quickly. 30 years ago in the lower New York state, Hudson Valley, for about three, four years there were a series of unbelievably incredible sightings by thousands of people."},{"segment_id":78,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This got the attention very quickly of national media by 1984."},{"segment_id":79,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The FAA quickly and clearly had, what could they literally say to the world?"},{"segment_id":80,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"\"Yes, there's these enormous boomerang-shaped objects flying over the Taconic Parkway."},{"segment_id":81,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But don't worry, even though we don't know who they are, we don't think they're here to eat us.\""},{"segment_id":82,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's just nothing that you could say, literally, to the public that would assuage their fears."},{"segment_id":83,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In 1997 over Phoenix, we have the incident of the famous Phoenix Lights, in which Governor Fife Symington at a press conference a few days later brought out a big guy in an alien costume and basically through cold water over the whole thing ridiculed it."},{"segment_id":84,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Ten years later, Governor Symington at this national press conference in 2007 said, not only did we have to do that to prevent public panic, which was in danger of escalating greatly at that moment, but I myself saw the object in question and it was unbelievable and he offered his strong opinion. He's an experienced pilot, by the way, that this is not anything from our civilization."},{"segment_id":85,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've had an opportunity to visit three or four aircraft carriers that a hundred or more planes can fly off of in my defense experience and the young men and women on ship who, nuclear submarines I might ask, aircraft carriers as well as nuclear submarines, I've seen the nukes lined up on the submarine, I don't know, 1,500 deep look like in rows."},{"segment_id":86,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We are supposedly the defense country of the world. If there's something in our atmosphere in the world that may question that, it seems to me, this member, that we need to take a look at it. If they wanted to blow us up, seems like they'd have done it 20, 30, 40 years ago. Maybe they want to coexist, but to not even begin to, whatever, you guys got more intelligence than I have. It's just the wrong way. I mean, there won't be a world."},{"segment_id":87,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Who wants that?"},{"segment_id":88,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Then my last one at this time would be the press, the press, very, very powerful.

Captain Salas?"},{"segment_id":89,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you, Ms. Gilpatrick. In 2004, I was contacted by the Peter Jennings group who's putting together a UFO special and flown to Dallas, Texas for about two or three days."},{"segment_id":90,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They interviewed me for a couple of days, got a lot of footage, said I had great testimony and they were going to feature my testimony on their special. With a week before that special, the Peter Jennings special on UFOs was to be broadcast. I got a call saying that they couldn't, they wouldn't be using my interview. There are other members here in the audience that were also interviewed for this. To me, they gave me no reason. I'm just suspicious that somebody got to them and did not want this story out."},{"segment_id":91,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Anyone else have any press? Before we go to the members, does anyone else at the table like to make a final statement as we go through? It may not be your final because we're going to interact a little bit longer, but if you want to add something at this point, otherwise I'll go right. Mr. Scott, Sergeant Scott?"},{"segment_id":92,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'd like to see the military and the local police be able to have their people, if they see a sighting or respond to a sighting, to be able to give an honest report of it. Because if it's a lie, if it's a joke and that, it's very easy to find that out quickly. If it's not, then what we're doing is gathering more intelligence information on a possible friend out there or a possible enemy. The more information we gather, the better it is for us. Right now the police department, my brother's a retired policeman, they would send a rookie cop out to investigate. They didn't want to do it. They would laugh about it. But once he found out I was coming here, then he got more serious after all these years and they told me he believed also."},{"segment_id":93,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Very good. Thank you. Are you hearing, sir? Okay. Let me then open it up to our members for our final or we can have some dialogue for a little while. Let me start with Councilman Bartlett."},{"segment_id":94,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you. I've been looking at some of the press clippings from yesterday's session and the government has been quite successful in relegating this issue to the lunatic fringe."},{"segment_id":95,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I have several articles. I'm going to comment on only one of them and I really don't know where it played. It says the mock Congress hearing on aliens is heavy on real-life Mulders and not Scullies. I didn't know who Mulders and Scullies were until I read it. But apparently in the X-Files, Agent Fox Mulder believes in all things, little green men, Roswell men in black, whatever, and Agent Dana Sculley believes in science. Sculley forces Mulder to find hard evidence that there's a massive conspiracy to cover up aliens' existence."},{"segment_id":96,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The problem with this week's alien panel, that we're an alien panel now, at the National Press Club is that any of the participating members of Congress who might nationally be a Scully have been incented to suspend their disbelief because the Citizen Hearing Foundation is paying them $20,000 plus expenses to listen to the testimony. That's just insulting that we can be bought for $20,000. That's ridiculous. It goes on to say that panelists, and I mention the panelists and I'm one of the panelists, and former member Roscoe Bartlett, in an opening statement, Bartlett said he hadn't fulfilled his duty in office by failing to hold hearings on extraterrestrials. I never said that. What I had said was that the Congress, I a part of it, had failed in its responsibility to respond to the constitutional requirement that we had a responsibility to respond to people to petition their government for a"},{"segment_id":97,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"redress of grievances. It's in the First Amendment. It's very clear. I never said that I believed in extraterrestrials. I believe that there are sightings out there that cannot be easily explained away. That is one of the possible explanations of them. There may be others."},{"segment_id":98,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I never made that statement. Compounding the problem of eyebrow-raising testimonies that several of these politicians have reputations for being a little wacky."},{"segment_id":99,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What does that end? Who said that? I don't know. Who said that? Who wrote it?"},{"segment_id":100,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't know. You tell me. No, no. Who's it from? What network of paper?"},{"segment_id":101,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't know. I can't tell you. This is the article. You tell me where it came from."},{"segment_id":102,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's terrible. It's terrible. Yeah. I want to read on. This is why I'm wacky. Bartlett has warned of the dangers of an electromagnetic pulse, a theoretical nuclear blast in space that would fry electrical circuits and kill the Internet. This is not theoretical."},{"segment_id":103,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We did precisely that in 1962 over at Johnson Island. It's called Starfish Prime, and it shut down – we didn't have any electronics in '62. It shut down electrical equipment in Hawaii 800 miles away. The Congress set up an EMP commission. It functioned for eight years for four congresses. It was chaired by Dr. Bill Graham, the science advisor to President Reagan. Johnny Foster was on it, the father of most of our nuclear weapons."},{"segment_id":104,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Dr. Joan Woodard was on it. She is the deputy director at Sandia Labs. And Dr. Lowell Wood from Lawrence Livermore was on it. This is the person that Tom Clancy told me, and his view was the smartest man hired by the U.S. government. That commission functioned for eight years. As a result of their functioning, the Pentagon has set up a permanent commission of permanent panel task force on EMP. John Kyle has made a statement that says that this is one of the few – as a matter of fact, I think it's the only event I know of – that could end us as a sovereign nation. You can read his comment on that."},{"segment_id":105,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know, I'm just insulted that the press does this. You know, these statements have no basis in reality. And I want to point out something else, how successful they've been."},{"segment_id":106,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Here is a fact sheet that is put out by the Air Force. And it's about Unidentified Flying Objects and Air Force Project Blue Book. They did everything they could to debunk 12,800 – 618 sightings, but 701 of them they could not find any way to rationalize it away. That's a pretty large number. And then they make two statements. You know, one thing they say is that there was never any indication of threat to our national security. Then why in heck the classification, the secret classification, that there's no threat to our security?"},{"segment_id":107,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Most of these things are just mutually exclusive, aren't they? You can't say one and then not – and then say the other. They said there was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as unidentified represented technology developed – developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge. It reminds me of Goebbels in his statement, \"Just say it often enough, no matter how big the lie and people will soon believe it.\" We have radar tracks. We have radar tracks showing that these objects, whatever they are, behave in ways that known aircraft of no country in the world can do. That just isn't true. There was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified were extraterrestrial vehicles. That's true. But there is a lot of evidence – but there was a lot of evidence – that they couldn't be anything that"},{"segment_id":108,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"is publicized by either our country or by Russia or by China.

One more war, but it's up there in space."},{"segment_id":117,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't want to do that.

And they don't have -- that's probably why we have seen less and less recently because they've done what -- you know, if humans can't figure out what they're capable of, then there's no -- they don't need to show us any other way.

But by the same token, if there's no other rational reason for something, you have to come to a conclusion. And the conclusion I can share with you, which is just logic, is if there's anything in this whole compendium of knowledge of UFOs, it's got to be what happened at Minot and Wyoming and so forth. What's been proven is that somebody out there, extraterrestrial, can shut off our defense capability just like that. Just like that. Now, how do you think that makes the people in Congress who are appropriating billions and billions of dollars for a defense system that doesn't work if you really push the shove?"},{"segment_id":132,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"(Applause.)"},{"segment_id":133,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so if there's ever a rationale for the government in cahoots with the military-industrial complex to defend the appropriation process that feeds them, it's got to be what's been discovered and they've got to put a lid on this.

It happened in Alaska."},{"segment_id":134,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know, we've got these silos in Alaska. We've got 16 of them.

They appropriated money for another 14 silos."},{"segment_id":135,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That will make 13 silos to go after North Korea. And I don't know if any of you know the defense concept. It's more expensive to build a shield than to build a spear. So you build all the shields you want.

And so deny it. It doesn't happen. It doesn't exist. Anybody talks about it, they're idiots. And so the press goes along with this. And we go back to our conclusion of yesterday. You know, I tried to conclude that we have a country ruled by juntas, military juntas and corporations in cahoots with our corporations. But what's been raised, and I hate to monopolize it on -- but maybe this afternoon is going to go too fast, but stop and think what we've concluded. That we're supposed to -- now, we didn't take an oath here. You took an oath. We didn't take an oath. But obviously you assume that all politicians"},{"segment_id":137,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"are truthful. Well, that's a fair sum.

Well, I for one will confess, I don't know anybody in a sense that I could approach that could give me five minutes' time on this particular subject, before or after the hearing. But what this hearing has done is not so much that it's going to persuade Congress. It's a first step to persuading the American public, or getting information out to the public. And that's where I think the great benefit and the contribution made with this hearing. But I just want to add one thing, and I'll follow through on it tomorrow or the day after. And that is, it's fine. We can educate the public. But does the public have any power to act on this new knowledge that they have? I don't see that.

This is five days, eight hours for five days."},{"segment_id":139,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When the likes of these pundits go out and speak, they get $30,000 for an hour.

And I says, \"Well, what do you get paid when you're out on a stump?\" This was somebody from Fox. And he confessed. $25,000, $30,000 is what he gets for an hour. And we're putting in 40 hours here. So we're underpaid, if anything, based upon the knowledge that we have."},{"segment_id":140,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I think we've concluded the reason for the cover-up. And that's really what we discovered today, this afternoon, was that somebody can shut off our defense just like that. And it's an embarrassment to the Air Force. It's an embarrassment to the federal government. It's an embarrassment to the Congress. And, of course, nobody wants to face that embarrassment."},{"segment_id":141,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That I yield.

I love you, North Dakota."},{"segment_id":146,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But wherever they come from, somebody is in Minot shutting off the missiles. Why?

I don't have to remind you about those possibilities in countries that are trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we've had enough nuclear weapons to destroy every living thing on Earth for a long, long time. And it would not take much to start a nuclear war, in my opinion. And that risk is getting worse. So I do believe that -- and I think they are extraterrestrial, and this is just my opinion -- that they are here to at least point to the fact that we are on the verge of annihilation, of suicide, if you will, our own civilization. And they would like to see us get rid of these weapons. And that's a message I got from my incident."},{"segment_id":148,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's my own conclusion that this was strictly a message. Get rid of your weapons. Get rid of those nuclear weapons. They are not weapons of war, by the way. They're weapons of mass destruction. They would never be used in a real war, because it would just be a complete suicide for civilization, like I said."},{"segment_id":149,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Anyone else want to jump in? Yes. Sergeant Scott? Yeah. In June of 2001, President Bush came on scene on ABC News, and it was carried throughout the networks and in Popular Mechanics magazine. He had with him a general from the Air Force, and he was announcing that the general was going to be the head of a new military force called the Space Force, and they were going to build this force and also put a military base on the moon. Now nobody questioned him on why. What was the purpose for that? But then September 11th comes around."},{"segment_id":150,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The terrorist attack comes. This general is posted as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Space Force never comes about. The question I have still, why did he want to create a new military force for outer space unless there's a threat? We have one. We have a space force. It's in existence. And it's been written about extensively. It's there. Okay. All right. Some acknowledge it and some don't. But your point's well taken, Sergeant. Is that the Black Ops? Black Ops, that's the real. Well, yeah, I know. You want me to answer that? No. No, I won't. No. Let me go to Congress. Oh, I'm sorry. He jumped in. Right, I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. Continuous. Your time, Congresswoman. I'd like to hear from you. I just said what he's talking about is Black Ops.

That's okay. I think they're at least trying to tell us to pay attention. We have the power to do this. Be careful. And one of my, I've got scenarios in my mind about, I've thought about this an awful lot. And one of my scenarios is perhaps in fact they've communicated with the leaders of the world and said back off from this stuff, or else you're going to annihilate yourself. And maybe that's why we cut back some of our missiles. And other scenarios, do these, I'll call them beings, do these entities, are we aware of these entities enough that they can go public instead of saying you can't handle the truth, we can't handle the truth, and going public with an innocuous thing like harmless beings that are visiting us just to keep in touch and everything's fine, or"},{"segment_id":152,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"do they consider us a species like we consider apes a species, or dolphins, or perhaps rodents, or perhaps insects? You know, so that sort of thing I don't want to know about. If it's just the fact that they're visiting and they're kind of trying to tell us to watch out for nuclear, they can come forward with that. The government should come forward to let us know, to ease our minds a bit. However, if it's the other scenarios, I just want to come forward and lie to us and tell us the entities are nice beings and they just want to warn us about nuclear.

I described to you one flight of 10 missiles that I'm aware of, but I'm also aware of other launch officers who've described to me similar situations. So, you know, it's not unique that him and I have been involved here. I mean, this was a situation that was occurring quite often when I served in 1966 and '67. And who knows that it's not still happening out there? There is no act of officers of any kind that will come out and admit that right now. But what I'd like to know is what's your speculation on these missiles being shut down?"},{"segment_id":157,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is that rhetorical, or you need an answer?"},{"segment_id":158,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'd like an answer to that."},{"segment_id":159,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, let me come back to you."},{"segment_id":160,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because I'm sure it would be just as good as my answer."},{"segment_id":161,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I might have something to end on, too. Let me get -- Let me offer one very -- 30-second opinion. I feel that we really do not have enough data, even now, to know exactly why this is happening. Because despite the number of cases where this does appear to have happened, there are thousands of missiles. And not all of them have been shut down, as far as we can tell. So if they're doing this, they're obviously not doing it uniformly. And I just -- I don't really feel that any researcher who has enough data to know precisely what those motivations might be. They obviously -- they seem to have demonstrated superiority over our technology. That's for sure. So at discrete moments, they seem to be able to do this. But they're not doing it uniformly. And they certainly haven't stopped all of the massive wars that have, you know, run over the planet. So there are"},{"segment_id":162,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"certain limits as to what they're willing to do, as well."},{"segment_id":163,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you.

From the things that you've described today, you all must have done what Captain Fenstermacher just indicated he has done. That's think about these things a lot during the times when you didn't say too much -- anything publicly, and after you've come out and started speaking, which, again, I congratulate the two of you that have done that today, for I understand the first time. So I think -- I've got to say, I think your speculations are a lot more informed than what our speculations might be on this. So I'd like to start with Captain Salas. And each of you have also said, I think, if I'm wrong on this, correct me, but that you've -- that you all complied, as you were asked to do and required to do, with the nondisclosure statements, short -- almost immediately after you described to your seniors in the military what you had just witnessed. Am I correct on that?"},{"segment_id":166,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, sir. You didn't?"},{"segment_id":167,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"See, I was involved in three sightings, three different bases, and not one time did I have to sign anything away.

You signed those -- Absolutely, sir."},{"segment_id":169,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, so -- Nondisclosure statement."},{"segment_id":170,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Absolutely. And I think your spec -- or your reasons that you might give this committee, this panel, as to both legitimate reasons why you might have been thinking over the years or at the time, that the Air Force might have asked you to do that, and the illegitimate reasons why they might have asked you to do that. There must -- you must have some idea on both sides of this what -- why did they make you come in and sign that right off the bat? I mean, and why were they then -- why were you then -- the whole culture was, don't talk about it, or you're going to be in trouble. What were the legitimate reasons for that, if there are -- if any, if any, or illegitimate reasons for that, if any?"},{"segment_id":171,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think I discovered the main reason, and that is -- is this on? Okay. That the Condon investigation was ongoing at the time, and the idea of the Condon investigation basically was to give the Air Force a way out of investigating UFOs. And if they had allowed me to speak to the Conant investigator about my incident, and Mr. Fiegel, and Mr. Mywald, and Mr. Carlson, they would have discovered that this was really a serious problem. And so that, I think, was the primary reason they were so anxious to get us to sign these nondisclosure statements at the time."},{"segment_id":172,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But that can also be very illegitimate, am I right? I'm talking about from the Air Force standpoint."},{"segment_id":173,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, if they were honest about this, that would have been illegitimate."},{"segment_id":174,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And my question is, what should they have done, and what should we start insisting the Air Force do?"},{"segment_id":175,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They should have been honest about it. They should have been straightforward about it, and let the people handle it. This belongs with the people. The people should decide something of this import, and not a small group of individuals in and out of government, which is what is going on right now. There is a small group of individuals, inside government and outside government, that are controlling this phenomenon. They're controlling the technology."},{"segment_id":176,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They're controlling what's said about it.

We didn't talk about it, but it is part of the phenomenon. And the abductions that are going on, another part of this phenomenon. This is such a complex thing, that these secrets are so powerful."},{"segment_id":184,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The men controlling this, men and women that are controlling this, I think the main motivation is power and greed."},{"segment_id":185,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Captain, Professor Markham, we're going to ask you this then. You made the comments about the filters, and I don't know all the technical terms, but I was quite interested.

'74, '75."},{"segment_id":186,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I would ask Captain Schindele and Captain Salas, isn't it likely or not that what you said to them, they believed you, because they started building technologies to protect against the very thing you were witnessing about? Am I right on that?"},{"segment_id":187,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, sir, as Mr. Bartlett pointed out, it was well known that nuclear explosions produce electromagnetic pulse."},{"segment_id":188,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But they don't just appear to the point where you need filters for the silos. Well, go ahead."},{"segment_id":189,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Excuse me, I didn't mean to."},{"segment_id":190,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was a bench test done at Boeing on the logic coupler, and it was shown in this bench test that at a certain frequency of EMP injected into the logic coupler that the coupler would be disabled. So they had that evidence. And so there's no doubt in my mind that one reason they tried to protect the missiles from EMP was nuclear explosions, but the other was as a result of the incident that I just described to help protect against UFO disabling the missiles."},{"segment_id":191,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Of course, they knew that."},{"segment_id":192,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, whether or not it was successful is another question."},{"segment_id":193,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":194,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"General, would you yield for just a moment?"},{"segment_id":195,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Certainly."},{"segment_id":196,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I just wanted to make an observation about that. We are using these bench test facilities several times, noted deficiencies in our ballistic missile system.

I appreciate that. And also just wanted to quickly ask, and so it's a little bit unclear in your mind, Captain Salas, Captain Schindele, that these filters that came in the '70s that were described here today, that they could have been brought forth by the Air Force because they were finally getting to something they felt had occurred as early as the 19--or that they knew about as early as the 1950s or something they might have experienced from the testimony."},{"segment_id":200,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because they've also been what you had told them, either one maybe. Or is that-- Well, I know I'm kind of into the weeds on this a little bit, and I apologize for that, but I just wanted to know whether--I mean, it really struck me when I heard Captain Fenstermacher the shields and the filters, that they had to have believed your testimonies and what you said you saw that day. They had to know that something was definitely happening, and then to keep this silent for 46 years as we've talked about."},{"segment_id":201,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know, I wasn't sure about this whole truth embargo even a few days ago, but this truth embargo indeed needs to start coming down."},{"segment_id":202,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The document that Bob Salas had released was very lengthy, really, with three sub-documents, and I spent a lot of time scanning it. And in fact, there was a little piece about UFOs."},{"segment_id":203,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What it was was a technical explanation of all the echo sites and what happened at each of the sites in the first document.

how EMF affected it, and that Boeing was going to work on the EMF problem."},{"segment_id":207,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I think what we installed was the result of his echo and Oscar flight and not his testimony, because it didn't happen."},{"segment_id":208,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They didn't believe him."},{"segment_id":209,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Just because they said they didn't believe him doesn't mean they didn't believe him."},{"segment_id":210,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah, but the technical aspects, they couldn't say it didn't happen,
