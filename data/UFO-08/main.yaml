    And Dr. Lowell Wood from Lawrence Livermore was on it. This is the person that
    Tom Clancy told me, and his view was the smartest man hired by the U.S. government.
    That commission functioned for eight years. As a result of their functioning,
    the Pentagon has set up a permanent commission of permanent panel task force on
    EMP. John Kyle has made a statement that says that this is one of the few – as
    a matter of fact, I think it's the only event I know of – that could end us as
    a sovereign nation. You can read his comment on that.

    you, which is just logic, is if there's anything in this whole compendium of knowledge
    of UFOs, it's got to be what happened at Minot and Wyoming and so forth. What's
    been proven is that somebody out there, extraterrestrial, can shut off our defense
    capability just like that. Just like that. Now, how do you think that makes the
    people in Congress who are appropriating billions and billions of dollars for
    a defense system that doesn't work if you really push the shove?

      UFO 知識彙編中有任何真實的事件，那必定是發生在邁諾特空軍基地和懷俄明州等地的事件。已經被證實的是，外太空的某個存在，外星的存在，能夠就這樣關閉我們的防禦能力。就這樣。現在，你認為這會讓國會那些撥款數十億美元用於防禦系統的人作何感想？如果真的面對緊急情況時，這個系統根本不管用？

    to annihilate yourself. And maybe that's why we cut back some of our missiles.

    situations. So, you know, it's not unique that him and I have been involved here.

    and '67. And who knows that it's not still happening out there? There is no act
    of officers of any kind that will come out and admit that right now. But what

    Salas. And each of you have also said, I think, if I'm wrong on this, correct
    me, but that you've -- that you all complied, as you were asked to do and required
    to do, with the nondisclosure statements, short -- almost immediately after you
    described to your seniors in the military what you had just witnessed. Am I correct
