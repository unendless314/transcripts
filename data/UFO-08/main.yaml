    to feature my testimony on their special. With a week before that special, the Peter Jennings special on UFOs was to be
    broadcast. I got a call saying that they couldn't, they wouldn't be using my interview. There are other members here in
    the audience that were also interviewed for this. To me, they gave me no reason. I'm just suspicious that somebody got
    to them and did not want this story out.

  source_text: I'd like to see the military and the local police be able to have their people, if they see a sighting or respond
    to a sighting, to be able to give an honest report of it. Because if it's a lie, if it's a joke and that, it's very easy
    to find that out quickly. If it's not, then what we're doing is gathering more intelligence information on a possible
    friend out there or a possible enemy. The more information we gather, the better it is for us. Right now the police department,
    my brother's a retired policeman, they would send a rookie cop out to investigate. They didn't want to do it. They would
    laugh about it. But once he found out I was coming here, then he got more serious after all these years and they told
    me he believed also.

    It says the mock Congress hearing on aliens is heavy on real-life Mulders and not Scullies. I didn't know who Mulders
    and Scullies were until I read it. But apparently in the X-Files, Agent Fox Mulder believes in all things, little green
    men, Roswell men in black, whatever, and Agent Dana Sculley believes in science. Sculley forces Mulder to find hard evidence
    that there's a massive conspiracy to cover up aliens' existence.

    any of the participating members of Congress who might nationally be a Scully have been incented to suspend their disbelief

    that we can be bought for $20,000. That's ridiculous. It goes on to say that panelists, and I mention the panelists and
    I'm one of the panelists, and former member Roscoe Bartlett, in an opening statement, Bartlett said he hadn't fulfilled
    his duty in office by failing to hold hearings on extraterrestrials. I never said that. What I had said was that the Congress,

    It functioned for eight years for four congresses. It was chaired by Dr. Bill Graham, the science advisor to President
    Reagan. Johnny Foster was on it, the father of most of our nuclear weapons.

    That commission functioned for eight years. As a result of their functioning, the Pentagon has set up a permanent commission

    of fact, I think it's the only event I know of – that could end us as a sovereign nation. You can read his comment on

    me of Goebbels in his statement, "Just say it often enough, no matter how big the lie and people will soon believe it."
    We have radar tracks. We have radar tracks showing that these objects, whatever they are, behave in ways that known aircraft
    of no country in the world can do. That just isn't true. There was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as
    unidentified were extraterrestrial vehicles. That's true. But there is a lot of evidence – but there was a lot of evidence

    need to show us any other way. Because I don't -- they obviously -- they may be -- probably aren't violent, because if
    they were -- did what they're capable of, they'd probably be eating some of us. You know?

    at Minot and Wyoming and so forth. What's been proven is that somebody out there, extraterrestrial, can shut off our defense
    capability just like that. Just like that. Now, how do you think that makes the people in Congress who are appropriating
    billions and billions of dollars for a defense system that doesn't work if you really push the shove?

    a first step to persuading the American public, or getting information out to the public. And that's where I think the
    great benefit and the contribution made with this hearing. But I just want to add one thing, and I'll follow through on
    it tomorrow or the day after. And that is, it's fine. We can educate the public. But does the public have any power to

    those possibilities in countries that are trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we've had enough nuclear weapons to destroy
    every living thing on Earth for a long, long time. And it would not take much to start a nuclear war, in my opinion. And
    that risk is getting worse. So I do believe that -- and I think they are extraterrestrial, and this is just my opinion
    -- that they are here to at least point to the fact that we are on the verge of annihilation, of suicide, if you will,
    our own civilization. And they would like to see us get rid of these weapons. And that's a message I got from my incident.

    Air Force, and he was announcing that the general was going to be the head of a new military force called the Space Force,
    and they were going to build this force and also put a military base on the moon. Now nobody questioned him on why. What
    was the purpose for that? But then September 11th comes around.

  source_text: The terrorist attack comes. This general is posted as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Space
    Force never comes about. The question I have still, why did he want to create a new military force for outer space unless
    there's a threat? We have one. We have a space force. It's in existence. And it's been written about extensively. It's
    there. Okay. All right. Some acknowledge it and some don't. But your point's well taken, Sergeant. Is that the Black Ops?
    Black Ops, that's the real. Well, yeah, I know. You want me to answer that? No. No, I won't. No. Let me go to Congress.
    Oh, I'm sorry. He jumped in. Right, I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. Continuous. Your time, Congresswoman. I'd like
    to hear from you. I just said what he's talking about is Black Ops. And I don't doubt that.

    And one of my, I've got scenarios in my mind about, I've thought about this an awful lot. And one of my scenarios is perhaps
    in fact they've communicated with the leaders of the world and said back off from this stuff, or else you're going to
    annihilate yourself. And maybe that's why we cut back some of our missiles. And other scenarios, do these, I'll call them
    beings, do these entities, are we aware of these entities enough that they can go public instead of saying you can't handle
    the truth, we can't handle the truth, and going public with an innocuous thing like harmless beings that are visiting

    kind of trying to tell us to watch out for nuclear, they can come forward with that. The government should come forward
    to let us know, to ease our minds a bit. However, if it's the other scenarios, I just want to come forward and lie to
    us and tell us the entities are nice beings and they just want to warn us about nuclear. I can't handle that truth that
    we're insects to these beings.

    occurring quite often when I served in 1966 and '67. And who knows that it's not still happening out there? There is no

    to have demonstrated superiority over our technology. That's for sure. So at discrete moments, they seem to be able to
    do this. But they're not doing it uniformly. And they certainly haven't stopped all of the massive wars that have, you

    indicated he has done. That's think about these things a lot during the times when you didn't say too much -- anything
    publicly, and after you've come out and started speaking, which, again, I congratulate the two of you that have done that
    today, for I understand the first time. So I think -- I've got to say, I think your speculations are a lot more informed
    than what our speculations might be on this. So I'd like to start with Captain Salas. And each of you have also said,
    I think, if I'm wrong on this, correct me, but that you've -- that you all complied, as you were asked to do and required
    to do, with the nondisclosure statements, short -- almost immediately after you described to your seniors in the military
    what you had just witnessed. Am I correct on that?

    And if they had allowed me to speak to the Conant investigator about my incident, and Mr. Fiegel, and Mr. Mywald, and
    Mr. Carlson, they would have discovered that this was really a serious problem. And so that, I think, was the primary
    reason they were so anxious to get us to sign these nondisclosure statements at the time.

    phenomenon, including paranormal subjects like telepathic thought, things like that, which are part of this phenomenon.
    We didn't talk about it, but it is part of the phenomenon. And the abductions that are going on, another part of this
    phenomenon. This is such a complex thing, that these secrets are so powerful.

    frequency of EMP injected into the logic coupler that the coupler would be disabled. So they had that evidence. And so
    there's no doubt in my mind that one reason they tried to protect the missiles from EMP was nuclear explosions, but the
    other was as a result of the incident that I just described to help protect against UFO disabling the missiles.

    Captain Salas, Captain Schindele, that these filters that came in the '70s that were described here today, that they could
    have been brought forth by the Air Force because they were finally getting to something they felt had occurred as early
    as the 19--or that they knew about as early as the 1950s or something they might have experienced from the testimony.

    me when I heard Captain Fenstermacher the shields and the filters, that they had to have believed your testimonies and
    what you said you saw that day. They had to know that something was definitely happening, and then to keep this silent
    for 46 years as we've talked about.
