      that he's aware of. I described to you one flight of 10 missiles that I'm aware
      of, but I'm also aware of other launch officers who've described to me similar
      situations. So, you know, it's not unique that him and I have been involved
      here. I mean, this was a situation that was occurring quite often when I served
      in 1966 and '67. And who knows that it's not still happening out there? There
      is no act of officers of any kind that will come out and admit that right now.
      But what I'd like to know is what's your speculation on these missiles being
      shut down?

      really what we discovered today, this afternoon, was that somebody can shut
      off our defense just like that. And it's an embarrassment to the Air Force.
      It's an embarrassment to the federal government. It's an embarrassment to the
      Congress. And, of course, nobody wants to face that embarrassment.

      take certainly hearings within the Congress and in the House and the Senate.
      But we have a big question, and that question is, are we doing this because
      we are going to arm space? And you know, let's just talk about getting rid of
      humanity in general. One more war, but it's up there in space.

      evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized
      as unidentified represented technology developed – developments or principles
      beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge. It reminds me of Goebbels in
      his statement, "Just say it often enough, no matter how big the lie and people
      will soon believe it." We have radar tracks. We have radar tracks showing that
      these objects, whatever they are, behave in ways that known aircraft of no country
      in the world can do. That just isn't true. There was no evidence indicating

    source_text: First of all, the world is facing a crisis right now about nuclear
      weapons. I don't have to remind you about those possibilities in countries that
      are trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we've had enough nuclear weapons
      to destroy every living thing on Earth for a long, long time. And it would not
      take much to start a nuclear war, in my opinion. And that risk is getting worse.
      So I do believe that -- and I think they are extraterrestrial, and this is just
      my opinion -- that they are here to at least point to the fact that we are on
      the verge of annihilation, of suicide, if you will, our own civilization. And
      they would like to see us get rid of these weapons. And that's a message I got
      from my incident.

      give an honest report of it. Because if it's a lie, if it's a joke and that,
      it's very easy to find that out quickly. If it's not, then what we're doing
      is gathering more intelligence information on a possible friend out there or
      a possible enemy. The more information we gather, the better it is for us. Right
      now the police department, my brother's a retired policeman, they would send
      a rookie cop out to investigate. They didn't want to do it. They would laugh
      about it. But once he found out I was coming here, then he got more serious

      the logic coupler that the coupler would be disabled. So they had that evidence.
      And so there's no doubt in my mind that one reason they tried to protect the
      missiles from EMP was nuclear explosions, but the other was as a result of the
      incident that I just described to help protect against UFO disabling the missiles.

      because in my opinion of the EMF filters and some of the documentation that

      his shutdowns, they were looking at EMF as a problem.

    source_text: Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. First of all, I'd like to thank our
      panel. You have been terrific. And anyone that wants to jump in and answer this
      question, I'm originally from North Dakota. I'm very familiar with Minot. So
      I have a problem with understanding why anyone would go to Minot. I'm sorry.
      That's not a good thing. I love you, North Dakota.

      missiles. Why? I mean, is that to show us that they can do that? Why would you
      do that?

    source_text: First of all, the world is facing a crisis right now about nuclear
      weapons. I don't have to remind you about those possibilities in countries that
      are trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we've had enough nuclear weapons
      to destroy every living thing on Earth for a long, long time. And it would not
      take much to start a nuclear war, in my opinion. And that risk is getting worse.
      So I do believe that -- and I think they are extraterrestrial, and this is just
      my opinion -- that they are here to at least point to the fact that we are on
      the verge of annihilation, of suicide, if you will, our own civilization. And
      they would like to see us get rid of these weapons. And that's a message I got
      from my incident.

    source_text: It's my own conclusion that this was strictly a message. Get rid
      of your weapons. Get rid of those nuclear weapons. They are not weapons of war,
      by the way. They're weapons of mass destruction. They would never be used in
      a real war, because it would just be a complete suicide for civilization, like
      I said.

    source_text: Anyone else want to jump in? Yes. Sergeant Scott? Yeah. In June of
      2001, President Bush came on scene on ABC News, and it was carried throughout
      the networks and in Popular Mechanics magazine. He had with him a general from
      the Air Force, and he was announcing that the general was going to be the head
      of a new military force called the Space Force, and they were going to build
      this force and also put a military base on the moon. Now nobody questioned him
      on why. What was the purpose for that? But then September 11th comes around.

      I have still, why did he want to create a new military force for outer space
      unless there's a threat? We have one. We have a space force. It's in existence.
      And it's been written about extensively. It's there. Okay. All right. Some acknowledge
      it and some don't. But your point's well taken, Sergeant. Is that the Black
      Ops? Black Ops, that's the real. Well, yeah, I know. You want me to answer that?
      No. No, I won't. No. Let me go to Congress. Oh, I'm sorry. He jumped in. Right,
      I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. Continuous. Your time, Congresswoman. I'd
      like to hear from you. I just said what he's talking about is Black Ops. And
      I don't doubt that.

    source_text: Thank you. From the things that you've described today, you all must
      have done what Captain Fenstermacher just indicated he has done. That's think
      about these things a lot during the times when you didn't say too much -- anything
      publicly, and after you've come out and started speaking, which, again, I congratulate
      the two of you that have done that today, for I understand the first time. So
      I think -- I've got to say, I think your speculations are a lot more informed
      than what our speculations might be on this. So I'd like to start with Captain
      Salas. And each of you have also said, I think, if I'm wrong on this, correct
      me, but that you've -- that you all complied, as you were asked to do and required
      to do, with the nondisclosure statements, short -- almost immediately after
      you described to your seniors in the military what you had just witnessed. Am
      I correct on that?

    source_text: I think I discovered the main reason, and that is -- is this on?
      Okay. That the Condon investigation was ongoing at the time, and the idea of
      the Condon investigation basically was to give the Air Force a way out of investigating
      UFOs. And if they had allowed me to speak to the Conant investigator about my
      incident, and Mr. Fiegel, and Mr. Mywald, and Mr. Carlson, they would have discovered
      that this was really a serious problem. And so that, I think, was the primary
      reason they were so anxious to get us to sign these nondisclosure statements
      at the time.

    source_text: There was a bench test done at Boeing on the logic coupler, and it
      was shown in this bench test that at a certain frequency of EMP injected into
      the logic coupler that the coupler would be disabled. So they had that evidence.
      And so there's no doubt in my mind that one reason they tried to protect the
      missiles from EMP was nuclear explosions, but the other was as a result of the
      incident that I just described to help protect against UFO disabling the missiles.
