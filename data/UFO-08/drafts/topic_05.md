→ {"text": "對大多數我們的潛在敵人而言，抵達這裡的最短路線是經由北極。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "依我判斷，我希望它永遠不會被使用，因為我認為它唯一可能被使用的時機是俄羅斯發射飛彈的時候，而它會很快被淹沒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. They have thousands of missiles.
→ {"text": "他們擁有數千枚飛彈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. In my judgment, they're the only country that would ever come over the pole, because if you have 100 weapons coming over, you know darn well where it came from.
→ {"text": "依我判斷，他們是唯一會從北極上空進攻的國家，因為如果有 100 枚武器從那裡飛來，你肯定知道它們來自哪裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. No one else has that many, so you know very well where it came from.
→ {"text": "沒有其他國家擁有那麼多飛彈，所以你很清楚它們來自哪裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "它們來自俄羅斯，所以他們沒有理由不從北極上空進攻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
