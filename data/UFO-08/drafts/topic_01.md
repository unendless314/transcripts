## Speaker Group 1

1. It's called the Hearing Back to Order.
→ {"text": "現在宣布聽證會恢復開會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. It's been wonderful.
→ {"text": "這是一次非常棒的聽證會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. We are into our last 50, 60 minutes of it, and it's, again, an honor to have chaired it and all of my members who have been invited to come, we appreciate your time as well.
→ {"text": "我們現在進入最後的五、六十分鐘，能夠主持這場聽證會再次令我感到榮幸，所有受邀前來的委員會成員，我們也非常感謝各位撥冗參與。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. Many have said they appreciate our time, and we think it's a mutual thing because there's -- in Congress, you can only be good at a couple things, and those are your major two committees, and you rely on others to help you get through the mirage of all of the rest of it.
→ {"text": "許多人表示感謝我們撥出時間，我們認為這是相互的，因為在國會中，你只能專精於幾件事，也就是你主要負責的兩個委員會，而你必須仰賴其他人幫助你度過其餘所有事務的迷霧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

5. And this is new for many of us, and we appreciate you very much.
→ {"text": "這對我們許多人來說都是全新的經驗，我們非常感謝各位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. We thought in this last hour or so that we'd go back to the panel first, if you have any comments that you'd like to make, and then the members will question, and then the members will have closing remarks.
→ {"text": "我們認為在最後這一小時左右的時間裡，首先回到證人小組，如果各位有任何想要發表的意見，然後由委員提問，最後由委員做結語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. We'll try to make time for that, and if you'd like to make a closing remark as well, we'll do that.
→ {"text": "我們會盡量安排時間，如果各位證人也想做結語，我們也會安排。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. I'd like to start off with this session with one question for all of you experienced men of this government and otherwise.
→ {"text": "我想以一個問題來開啟這個會期，這個問題是給所有在政府部門和其他領域經驗豐富的各位先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. Why do you believe today and 30, 40 years ago, the military primary -- primarily has suppressed the whole idea of what might be unidentified flying objects or extraterrestrial?
→ {"text": "為什麼你們認為，無論是今天還是三、四十年前，軍方主要都在壓制關於不明飛行物或外星生命的整個概念？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. And we can start anywhere, but why do you think they've done that?
→ {"text": "我們可以從任何地方開始，但你們認為他們為什麼這麼做？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. Never mentioned it again?
→ {"text": "再也不提起？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. Act like it never happened?
→ {"text": "表現得像什麼都沒發生過？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. It didn't really happen?
→ {"text": "這一切並未真正發生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. You know, those kinds of things.
→ {"text": "你們知道，諸如此類的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. Is there something we ought to know there?
→ {"text": "在這方面有什麼我們應該知道的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. Anybody got a comment on that?
→ {"text": "有人想對此發表意見嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. First of all, I think it's the technology factor.
→ {"text": "首先，我認為是技術因素。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. If they do have tangible objects in hand and have learned some technology, that is a very valuable stuff.
→ {"text": "如果他們確實掌握了實體物品並從中學到了某些技術，那是非常寶貴的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. That we don't have.
→ {"text": "那是我們所沒有的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. Technology that we don't currently have.
→ {"text": "我們目前還沒有的技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. That they have recovered, yes.
→ {"text": "他們已經回收了，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. Oh, that they've recovered of ours.
→ {"text": "噢，他們回收的是我們的。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語境稍微模糊，可能是在確認對話內容"}

24. If they have recovered, UFO technology, that is very valuable stuff, and that's worth keeping a secret.
→ {"text": "如果他們回收了不明飛行物的技術，那是非常寶貴的東西，值得保密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. The other thing is, if they were to let the general public know that they have no control over these objects, that they chase them, they can't catch them, that's something they didn't want the public to really know.
→ {"text": "另一件事是，如果他們讓一般大眾知道他們無法控制這些物體，他們追逐這些物體卻無法捕捉到，這是他們不想讓公眾真正知道的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. Those are very good.
→ {"text": "這些都是非常好的理由。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. The first being that our country may have acquired some new technology that we learned from them.
→ {"text": "第一個理由是我們國家可能獲得了一些從它們那裡學到的新技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. Was that your first point?
→ {"text": "那是你的第一個論點嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. Was your point something like that?
→ {"text": "你的論點是類似這樣的意思嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. That was my first point.
→ {"text": "那是我的第一個論點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. If they have recovered technology.
→ {"text": "如果他們回收了技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. All right.
→ {"text": "好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. And the second point.
→ {"text": "那第二個論點呢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. That is one reason for keeping it secret.
→ {"text": "這是保密的一個理由。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. The other one is they wouldn't want the public to know that they have no control over these objects.
→ {"text": "另一個理由是他們不想讓公眾知道他們無法控制這些物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. These objects that are seemingly controlled by some kind of intelligence.
→ {"text": "這些物體似乎受到某種智慧體的控制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. And why would they not want the public to know that we don't know what's there, or that they might be superior?
→ {"text": "那他們為什麼不想讓公眾知道我們不清楚那裡有什麼，或者它們可能比我們優越？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. Mr. Scott?
→ {"text": "Scott 先生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. They're afraid that we would panic.
→ {"text": "他們害怕我們會恐慌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. We as a people?
→ {"text": "我們作為一個民族？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. We as a country?
→ {"text": "我們作為一個國家？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. As a country, as the world, they're afraid that western civilization would collapse, western religion would collapse.
→ {"text": "作為一個國家，作為整個世界，他們害怕西方文明會崩潰，西方宗教會崩潰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. Your mind can go crazy on thinking the worst thing.
→ {"text": "當你想到最糟的情況時，你的思緒可能會變得混亂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. And if you say, well, let's bring a one world government into this for a defense, well, that could prove to be a one world dictatorship also.
→ {"text": "如果你說，好吧，讓我們為了防禦而建立一個世界政府，嗯，那也可能最終證明是一個世界獨裁政權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. So I can understand why the military and intelligence is keeping a lid on this until they might feel safe to let the cat out of the bag, but it's going to happen anyway.
→ {"text": "所以我能理解為什麼軍方和情報機構要對此保密，直到他們覺得可以安全地揭開真相為止，但這無論如何終究會發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. And those are very good points.
→ {"text": "這些都是非常好的論點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. Both of those.
→ {"text": "兩個論點都是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. I'm going to let Mr. Salas and I'm going to come to Mr. Dole.
→ {"text": "我要請 Salas 先生發言，然後我會請 Dole 先生發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Robert Salas 上尉"}

51. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. I'll just take the obvious in regards to my case, and that is these objects know in great detail how our missiles operate.
→ {"text": "我就從我的案例中最明顯的事實談起，那就是這些物體非常詳細地知道我們的飛彈如何運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. They know ours, but we don't know theirs.
→ {"text": "它們了解我們的，但我們不了解它們的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. That's right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. They can shut down our missiles at any time.
→ {"text": "它們可以隨時關閉我們的飛彈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. They have proven that.
→ {"text": "它們已經證明了這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. They know in great detail how they operate.
→ {"text": "它們非常詳細地知道這些飛彈如何運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. And so if you release that information to public, what do you say then about, you know, what kind of defense do we have against these things?
→ {"text": "所以如果你向公眾公開這些資訊，你要怎麼說，你知道，我們對這些東西有什麼樣的防禦能力？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

59. Anyone else?
→ {"text": "還有其他人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. Captain.
→ {"text": "上尉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. Well, they could shut our missiles down until we put EMF filters on our missiles in the early '70s, and by '76, they couldn't shut them down, because in my opinion of the EMF filters and some of the documentation that Robert Salas got unsealed, I looked at and found, in fact, in '68, after studying his shutdowns, they were looking at EMF as a problem.
→ {"text": "嗯，它們能夠關閉我們的飛彈，直到我們在 1970 年代初期在飛彈上安裝了 EMF 過濾器，到了 1976 年，它們就無法關閉飛彈了，因為根據我對 EMF 過濾器的了解，以及 Robert Salas 設法解密的一些文件，我查閱後發現，事實上在 1968 年，在研究他遭遇的飛彈關閉事件後，他們就將 EMF 視為一個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: EMF filters, Robert Salas"}

63. And I do distinctly remember our missiles being pulled offline one at a time before our incident happened and asked one of the members of the security maintenance teams, and they let it out of the bag that it was an EMF filter, and then they got shushed for it.
→ {"text": "我確實清楚記得在我們的事件發生前，我們的飛彈被逐一下線，我詢問了其中一名安全維護小組成員，他們不小心洩漏說那是 EMF 過濾器，然後他們就被要求噤聲了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. And I also accompanied a nuclear warhead or crew duty.
→ {"text": "我也曾執行核彈頭護送任務或機組值勤。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語句稍微不完整，可能是口語表達"}

65. Additional duty would be to do that on a convoy where we took a nuclear warhead out to a missile site to be replaced, to swap it out.
→ {"text": "額外的任務就是在護送車隊中執行，我們將核彈頭運送到飛彈基地進行更換。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. So in my opinion, the EMF filters caused a problem to these entities until they worked around that by the time in 2010.
→ {"text": "所以我認為，EMF 過濾器對這些實體造成了問題，直到它們在 2010 年前找到了解決辦法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. I don't want to disagree with Mr. Fenstermacher, but I would like to point out that about the incident that I just mentioned in 2010, the jury's still out as to whether or not that was a UFO incident where 50 nuclear missiles were shut down while objects were seen overhead.
→ {"text": "我不想與 Fenstermacher 先生意見相左，但我想指出，關於我剛才提到的 2010 年事件，這是否是一起在有物體被目擊於上空時 50 枚核飛彈被關閉的不明飛行物事件，目前仍無定論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Captain Fenstermacher"}

68. But I certainly agree that after our incident in the early days, electromagnetic pulse or electromagnetic force was considered a possible cause for the shutdowns, and the Air Force did have an active program to improve the EMP protection.
→ {"text": "但我確實同意，在我們早期的事件之後，電磁脈衝或電磁力被認為是飛彈關閉的可能原因，而且空軍確實有一個積極的計畫來改進電磁脈衝防護。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: electromagnetic pulse, EMP"}

69. Mr. Dolan?
→ {"text": "Dolan 先生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Richard Dolan, UFO researcher"}

70. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. I think the answers of technology and panic are probably top of the list.
→ {"text": "我認為技術和恐慌這兩個答案可能是最主要的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

72. Certainly if even one artifact of a UFO were ever recovered, and those who've studied this matter in detail most believe that that is the case, one can easily see why that would be of paramount interest to keep from other parties that you don't want to have that technology.
→ {"text": "當然，如果曾經回收過哪怕一件不明飛行物的文物，而大多數深入研究此事的人都相信確實如此，那麼人們很容易理解為什麼絕對有必要對其他你不希望擁有這項技術的勢力保密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. So the only way to do that for sure is to deny that there's a phenomenon that exists whatsoever.
→ {"text": "所以要確保做到這一點的唯一方法就是否認這種現象的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. But we actually know from the declassified literature that even as early as 1947, there were wind tunnel tests of disk-shaped airframes that were being conducted at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, and these were explicitly based on UFO sightings.
→ {"text": "但我們實際上從解密的文獻中得知，早在 1947 年，俄亥俄州代頓的萊特機場就進行了碟形機身的風洞測試，而這些測試明確是基於不明飛行物的目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Wright Field"}

75. We have a document from October 1947 authored by Colonel Wentworth, I believe, in which he references this.
→ {"text": "我們有一份我相信是溫特沃斯上校撰寫的 1947 年 10 月文件，其中提到了這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Colonel Wentworth"}

76. So the obvious connection between UFO sightings alone and technological development is right there from the beginning.
→ {"text": "所以僅從不明飛行物目擊事件與技術發展之間的明顯聯繫，從一開始就存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. But the idea of panic is the worst, because what we find in many cases is that panic can escalate very quickly. 30 years ago in the lower New York state, Hudson Valley, for about three, four years there were a series of unbelievably incredible sightings by thousands of people.
→ {"text": "但恐慌這個理由是最糟糕的，因為我們在許多案例中發現恐慌可以迅速升級。三十年前在紐約州下部的哈德遜谷，大約有三、四年的時間，數千人目擊了一系列令人難以置信的驚人景象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Hudson Valley"}

78. This got the attention very quickly of national media by 1984.
→ {"text": "到了 1984 年，這件事很快引起了全國媒體的關注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. The FAA quickly and clearly had, what could they literally say to the world?
→ {"text": "聯邦航空總署迅速且清楚地面臨，他們實際上能對世界說什麼呢？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句子稍微不完整，口語表達"}

80. "Yes, there's these enormous boomerang-shaped objects flying over the Taconic Parkway.
→ {"text": "「是的，有這些巨大的回旋鏢形物體在塔科尼克公園大道上空飛行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Taconic Parkway"}

81. But don't worry, even though we don't know who they are, we don't think they're here to eat us."
→ {"text": "但別擔心，雖然我們不知道它們是誰，但我們不認為它們來這裡是要吃掉我們。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. There's just nothing that you could say, literally, to the public that would assuage their fears.
→ {"text": "實際上你根本無法對公眾說任何能夠緩解他們恐懼的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. In 1997 over Phoenix, we have the incident of the famous Phoenix Lights, in which Governor Fife Symington at a press conference a few days later brought out a big guy in an alien costume and basically through cold water over the whole thing ridiculed it.
→ {"text": "1997 年在鳳凰城上空，我們有著名的鳳凰城光點事件，當時州長費伏·森明頓在幾天後的記者會上帶出一個穿著外星人服裝的壯漢，基本上對整件事潑冷水並加以嘲弄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Phoenix Lights, Governor Fife Symington"}

84. Ten years later, Governor Symington at this national press conference in 2007 said, not only did we have to do that to prevent public panic, which was in danger of escalating greatly at that moment, but I myself saw the object in question and it was unbelievable and he offered his strong opinion. He's an experienced pilot, by the way, that this is not anything from our civilization.
→ {"text": "十年後，森明頓州長在 2007 年的全國記者會上說，我們不僅必須這麼做以防止當時有升級危險的公眾恐慌，而且我本人也看到了那個物體，它令人難以置信，他提出了自己的強烈看法。順帶一提，他是一位經驗豐富的飛行員，他認為這不是來自我們文明的任何東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
