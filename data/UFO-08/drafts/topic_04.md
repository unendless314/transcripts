## Speaker Group 1

164. Thank you, Congresswoman -- Congressman Cook.

165. Thank you. From the things that you've described today, you all must have done what Captain Fenstermacher just indicated he has done. That's think about these things a lot during the times when you didn't say too much -- anything publicly, and after you've come out and started speaking, which, again, I congratulate the two of you that have done that today, for I understand the first time. So I think -- I've got to say, I think your speculations are a lot more informed than what our speculations might be on this. So I'd like to start with Captain Salas. And each of you have also said, I think, if I'm wrong on this, correct me, but that you've -- that you all complied, as you were asked to do and required to do, with the nondisclosure statements, short -- almost immediately after you described to your seniors in the military what you had just witnessed. Am I correct on that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. Yes, sir. You didn't?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. See, I was involved in three sightings, three different bases, and not one time did I have to sign anything away. Okay, Sergeant Scott, I appreciate that clarification.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. But I'm right, for example -- let's start with Captain Salas. You signed those -- Absolutely, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. Okay, so -- Nondisclosure statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. Absolutely. And I think your spec -- or your reasons that you might give this committee, this panel, as to both legitimate reasons why you might have been thinking over the years or at the time, that the Air Force might have asked you to do that, and the illegitimate reasons why they might have asked you to do that. There must -- you must have some idea on both sides of this what -- why did they make you come in and sign that right off the bat? I mean, and why were they then -- why were you then -- the whole culture was, don't talk about it, or you're going to be in trouble. What were the legitimate reasons for that, if there are -- if any, if any, or illegitimate reasons for that, if any?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. I think I discovered the main reason, and that is -- is this on? Okay. That the Condon investigation was ongoing at the time, and the idea of the Condon investigation basically was to give the Air Force a way out of investigating UFOs. And if they had allowed me to speak to the Conant investigator about my incident, and Mr. Fiegel, and Mr. Mywald, and Mr. Carlson, they would have discovered that this was really a serious problem. And so that, I think, was the primary reason they were so anxious to get us to sign these nondisclosure statements at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. But that can also be very illegitimate, am I right? I'm talking about from the Air Force standpoint.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. Well, if they were honest about this, that would have been illegitimate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. And my question is, what should they have done, and what should we start insisting the Air Force do?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. They should have been honest about it. They should have been straightforward about it, and let the people handle it. This belongs with the people. The people should decide something of this import, and not a small group of individuals in and out of government, which is what is going on right now. There is a small group of individuals, inside government and outside government, that are controlling this phenomenon. They're controlling the technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. They're controlling what's said about it. They're spreading disinformation about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. They are controlling the press, I think. And that's how they're keeping the ridicule factor going.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. Well, 1967, '66, in your experience, that's 45 years ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. Forty-six. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. Why aren't they releasing some of these statements by now, if you know, if you have any reasons for it? I mean, I just want to understand this as best I can. There's no way to pry open a can, unless you have the right tools to pry it open with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. If you just want my opinion, I'll be glad to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. Yes, well, that's what I'm asking. I want to know anybody else's opinion, if you have one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. I do think it's about power and greed. It is not about concern for public safety. That window passed a long time ago. But right now, because they have discovered so much about the technology and many other things regarding this phenomenon, including paranormal subjects like telepathic thought, things like that, which are part of this phenomenon. We didn't talk about it, but it is part of the phenomenon. And the abductions that are going on, another part of this phenomenon. This is such a complex thing, that these secrets are so powerful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. The men controlling this, men and women that are controlling this, I think the main motivation is power and greed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. Captain, Professor Markham, we're going to ask you this then. You made the comments about the filters, and I don't know all the technical terms, but I was quite interested. The timing of those filters coming on to protect nuclear installations, and that was in the '70s, you say? '74, '75.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. Well, I would ask Captain Schindele and Captain Salas, isn't it likely or not that what you said to them, they believed you, because they started building technologies to protect against the very thing you were witnessing about? Am I right on that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. Well, sir, as Mr. Bartlett pointed out, it was well known that nuclear explosions produce electromagnetic pulse.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. But they don't just appear to the point where you need filters for the silos. Well, go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. Excuse me, I didn't mean to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. There was a bench test done at Boeing on the logic coupler, and it was shown in this bench test that at a certain frequency of EMP injected into the logic coupler that the coupler would be disabled. So they had that evidence. And so there's no doubt in my mind that one reason they tried to protect the missiles from EMP was nuclear explosions, but the other was as a result of the incident that I just described to help protect against UFO disabling the missiles.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. Of course, they knew that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. Well, whether or not it was successful is another question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. General, would you yield for just a moment?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. Certainly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. I just wanted to make an observation about that. We are using these bench test facilities several times, noted deficiencies in our ballistic missile system. And we have corrected those.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. The last time we tested and the last time that we found deficiencies and fixed them, we never tested. We don't know whether they're fixed or not, but neither do the Russians.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. And so there's that big question, and that's how we left it. They aren't so sure what they'll work. We aren't dead sure they will work, but if there's any question about whether they will work or not, the mad philosophy still is offered, isn't it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. Okay. I appreciate that. And also just wanted to quickly ask, and so it's a little bit unclear in your mind, Captain Salas, Captain Schindele, that these filters that came in the '70s that were described here today, that they could have been brought forth by the Air Force because they were finally getting to something they felt had occurred as early as the 19--or that they knew about as early as the 1950s or something they might have experienced from the testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. Because they've also been what you had told them, either one maybe. Or is that-- Well, I know I'm kind of into the weeds on this a little bit, and I apologize for that, but I just wanted to know whether--I mean, it really struck me when I heard Captain Fenstermacher the shields and the filters, that they had to have believed your testimonies and what you said you saw that day. They had to know that something was definitely happening, and then to keep this silent for 46 years as we've talked about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. You know, I wasn't sure about this whole truth embargo even a few days ago, but this truth embargo indeed needs to start coming down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. The document that Bob Salas had released was very lengthy, really, with three sub-documents, and I spent a lot of time scanning it. And in fact, there was a little piece about UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. What it was was a technical explanation of all the echo sites and what happened at each of the sites in the first document. And there was a little piece about UFOs, and it said, "The rumor of any UFO creating this is disproved, just disowned." Disowned, I think, wasn't it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. It was disproven.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. The rumor was disproven. Now, I don't know how you disprove a rumor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. But at the very end document, it was a '68 document where they talked about they were concerned with how EMF affected it, and that Boeing was going to work on the EMF problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. And I think what we installed was the result of his echo and Oscar flight and not his testimony, because it didn't happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. They didn't believe him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. Just because they said they didn't believe him doesn't mean they didn't believe him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. Yeah, but the technical aspects, they couldn't say it didn't happen, because the flight had all these errors, and this is what happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. I think you're being very humble, Mr. Captain, and all of you, because you probably create a lot more technology than you believe, or that you even are willing to talk about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. Thank you very much, Congressman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
