## Speaker Group 1

164. Thank you, Congresswoman -- Congressman Cook.
→ {"text": "謝謝您，女眾議員——Cook 眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. Thank you. From the things that you've described today, you all must have done what Captain Fenstermacher just indicated he has done. That's think about these things a lot during the times when you didn't say too much -- anything publicly, and after you've come out and started speaking, which, again, I congratulate the two of you that have done that today, for I understand the first time. So I think -- I've got to say, I think your speculations are a lot more informed than what our speculations might be on this. So I'd like to start with Captain Salas. And each of you have also said, I think, if I'm wrong on this, correct me, but that you've -- that you all complied, as you were asked to do and required to do, with the nondisclosure statements, short -- almost immediately after you described to your seniors in the military what you had just witnessed. Am I correct on that?
→ {"text": "謝謝。從你們今天所描述的事情來看，你們所有人一定都做了芬斯特馬赫上尉剛才所說的事情，也就是在你們沒有公開說太多——或任何話的那段時間裡，大量思考這些事情，以及在你們出來開始發聲之後。我再次恭喜你們兩位今天這樣做，我理解這是第一次。所以我認為——我不得不說，我認為你們的推測比我們在這方面的推測要有根據得多。所以我想從薩拉斯上尉開始。你們每個人也都說過，我想，如果我錯了請糾正我，但你們——你們都遵守了要求你們做的事情，簽署了保密聲明，幾乎就在你們向軍中上級描述了你們剛剛目擊的事情之後。我說的對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. Yes, sir. You didn't?
→ {"text": "是的，先生。您沒有嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. See, I was involved in three sightings, three different bases, and not one time did I have to sign anything away. Okay, Sergeant Scott, I appreciate that clarification.
→ {"text": "您看，我參與過三次目擊事件，在三個不同的基地，沒有一次我需要簽署任何東西。好的，Scott 中士，我感謝您的澄清。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. But I'm right, for example -- let's start with Captain Salas. You signed those -- Absolutely, sir.
→ {"text": "但我說的對，比如——讓我們從薩拉斯上尉開始。您簽署了那些——絕對是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. Okay, so -- Nondisclosure statement.
→ {"text": "好的，所以——保密聲明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. Absolutely. And I think your spec -- or your reasons that you might give this committee, this panel, as to both legitimate reasons why you might have been thinking over the years or at the time, that the Air Force might have asked you to do that, and the illegitimate reasons why they might have asked you to do that. There must -- you must have some idea on both sides of this what -- why did they make you come in and sign that right off the bat? I mean, and why were they then -- why were you then -- the whole culture was, don't talk about it, or you're going to be in trouble. What were the legitimate reasons for that, if there are -- if any, if any, or illegitimate reasons for that, if any?
→ {"text": "絕對是的。我認為你們的推測——或者說你們可能向這個委員會、這個小組提出的理由，關於空軍當時可能要求你們這樣做的正當理由，以及他們可能要求你們這樣做的不正當理由。你們多年來或當時一定在思考這些。你們必定——你們必定對此有一些想法，為什麼他們讓你們立刻進來簽署那份文件？我是說，為什麼他們當時——為什麼你們當時——整個文化就是，不要談論它，否則你就會有麻煩。這樣做的正當理由是什麼，如果有的話——如果有的話，或者不正當理由是什麼，如果有的話？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. I think I discovered the main reason, and that is -- is this on? Okay. That the Condon investigation was ongoing at the time, and the idea of the Condon investigation basically was to give the Air Force a way out of investigating UFOs. And if they had allowed me to speak to the Conant investigator about my incident, and Mr. Fiegel, and Mr. Mywald, and Mr. Carlson, they would have discovered that this was really a serious problem. And so that, I think, was the primary reason they were so anxious to get us to sign these nondisclosure statements at the time.
→ {"text": "我認為我發現了主要原因，那就是——這個開著嗎？好的。當時康登調查正在進行中，而康登調查的目的基本上是為空軍提供一個退出調查 UFO 的途徑。如果他們允許我向康登調查員談論我的事件，以及 Fiegel 先生、Mywald 先生和 Carlson 先生的事件，他們就會發現這確實是一個嚴重的問題。所以我認為，這就是他們當時如此急於讓我們簽署這些保密聲明的主要原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Conant investigation 應為 Condon investigation（康登調查），已按正確名稱翻譯"}

172. But that can also be very illegitimate, am I right? I'm talking about from the Air Force standpoint.
→ {"text": "但這也可能非常不正當，我說的對嗎？我是從空軍的立場來說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. Well, if they were honest about this, that would have been illegitimate.
→ {"text": "嗯，如果他們對此誠實的話，那就會是不正當的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. And my question is, what should they have done, and what should we start insisting the Air Force do?
→ {"text": "我的問題是，他們應該做什麼，我們應該開始堅持要求空軍做什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. They should have been honest about it. They should have been straightforward about it, and let the people handle it. This belongs with the people. The people should decide something of this import, and not a small group of individuals in and out of government, which is what is going on right now. There is a small group of individuals, inside government and outside government, that are controlling this phenomenon. They're controlling the technology.
→ {"text": "他們應該對此誠實。他們應該直截了當地對待此事，讓人民來處理它。這應該屬於人民。人民應該決定如此重要的事情，而不是政府內外的一小群個人，這正是現在正在發生的事情。有一小群個人，在政府內部和政府外部，正在控制這個現象。他們正在控制這項技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. They're controlling what's said about it. They're spreading disinformation about it.
→ {"text": "他們正在控制關於它的言論。他們正在散佈關於它的虛假訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. They are controlling the press, I think. And that's how they're keeping the ridicule factor going.
→ {"text": "我認為他們正在控制媒體。這就是他們如何保持嘲笑因素持續運作的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

178. Well, 1967, '66, in your experience, that's 45 years ago.
→ {"text": "嗯，1967 年、66 年，以你的經驗來說，那是 45 年前的事了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. Forty-six. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "46 年。是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. Why aren't they releasing some of these statements by now, if you know, if you have any reasons for it? I mean, I just want to understand this as best I can. There's no way to pry open a can, unless you have the right tools to pry it open with.
→ {"text": "為什麼他們到現在還不公開其中一些聲明，如果你知道的話，如果你有任何理由的話？我是說，我只是想盡可能理解這件事。除非你有合適的工具來撬開，否則沒有辦法撬開一個罐頭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

181. If you just want my opinion, I'll be glad to.
→ {"text": "如果您只是想要我的意見，我很樂意提供。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. Yes, well, that's what I'm asking. I want to know anybody else's opinion, if you have one.
→ {"text": "是的，嗯，這正是我在問的。我想知道任何其他人的意見，如果你有的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. I do think it's about power and greed. It is not about concern for public safety. That window passed a long time ago. But right now, because they have discovered so much about the technology and many other things regarding this phenomenon, including paranormal subjects like telepathic thought, things like that, which are part of this phenomenon. We didn't talk about it, but it is part of the phenomenon. And the abductions that are going on, another part of this phenomenon. This is such a complex thing, that these secrets are so powerful.
→ {"text": "我確實認為這是關於權力和貪婪。這與公共安全的考量無關。那個時機早已過去。但現在，因為他們已經發現了太多關於這項技術以及有關這個現象的許多其他事情，包括像心靈感應思想這樣的超自然主題，諸如此類的事情，這些都是這個現象的一部分。我們沒有談論它，但它是這個現象的一部分。還有正在發生的綁架事件，也是這個現象的另一部分。這是一件如此複雜的事情，以至於這些秘密是如此強大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. The men controlling this, men and women that are controlling this, I think the main motivation is power and greed.
→ {"text": "控制這件事的男人，控制這件事的男人和女人，我認為主要動機是權力和貪婪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. Captain, Professor Markham, we're going to ask you this then. You made the comments about the filters, and I don't know all the technical terms, but I was quite interested. The timing of those filters coming on to protect nuclear installations, and that was in the '70s, you say? '74, '75.
→ {"text": "上尉，Markham 教授，那麼我們要問你這個問題。你對過濾器發表了評論，我不知道所有的技術術語，但我非常感興趣。那些用於保護核設施的過濾器出現的時機，你說那是在 70 年代嗎？74 年、75 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. Well, I would ask Captain Schindele and Captain Salas, isn't it likely or not that what you said to them, they believed you, because they started building technologies to protect against the very thing you were witnessing about? Am I right on that?
→ {"text": "嗯，我想問 Schindele 上尉和薩拉斯上尉，你們對他們說的話，他們相信了你們，是不是很有可能，因為他們開始建造技術來防禦你們所目擊的那件事？我說的對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. Well, sir, as Mr. Bartlett pointed out, it was well known that nuclear explosions produce electromagnetic pulse.
→ {"text": "嗯，先生，正如 Bartlett 先生指出的，眾所周知核爆炸會產生電磁脈衝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

188. But they don't just appear to the point where you need filters for the silos. Well, go ahead.
→ {"text": "但它們不會只是出現到你需要為發射井安裝過濾器的程度。嗯，請繼續。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. Excuse me, I didn't mean to.
→ {"text": "對不起，我不是故意的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. There was a bench test done at Boeing on the logic coupler, and it was shown in this bench test that at a certain frequency of EMP injected into the logic coupler that the coupler would be disabled. So they had that evidence. And so there's no doubt in my mind that one reason they tried to protect the missiles from EMP was nuclear explosions, but the other was as a result of the incident that I just described to help protect against UFO disabling the missiles.
→ {"text": "波音公司對邏輯耦合器進行了台架測試，這個台架測試顯示，在特定頻率的電磁脈衝注入邏輯耦合器時，耦合器會失效。所以他們有這個證據。所以我毫不懷疑，他們試圖保護飛彈免受電磁脈衝影響的一個原因是核爆炸，但另一個原因是我剛才描述的事件的結果，以幫助防禦 UFO 關閉飛彈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. Of course, they knew that.
→ {"text": "當然，他們知道那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. Well, whether or not it was successful is another question.
→ {"text": "嗯，它是否成功是另一個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. General, would you yield for just a moment?
→ {"text": "將軍，您能讓一下嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. Certainly.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

196. I just wanted to make an observation about that. We are using these bench test facilities several times, noted deficiencies in our ballistic missile system. And we have corrected those.
→ {"text": "我只是想對此做一個觀察。我們多次使用這些台架測試設施，注意到我們彈道飛彈系統的缺陷。我們已經糾正了這些缺陷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. The last time we tested and the last time that we found deficiencies and fixed them, we never tested. We don't know whether they're fixed or not, but neither do the Russians.
→ {"text": "我們最後一次測試以及我們最後一次發現缺陷並修復它們時，我們從未測試過。我們不知道它們是否修復了，但俄羅斯人也不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. And so there's that big question, and that's how we left it. They aren't so sure what they'll work. We aren't dead sure they will work, but if there's any question about whether they will work or not, the mad philosophy still is offered, isn't it?
→ {"text": "所以有那個大問題，我們就是這樣留下它的。他們不太確定它們會起作用。我們也不是完全確定它們會起作用，但如果對它們是否會起作用有任何疑問，互相保證毀滅哲學仍然有效，不是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. Okay. I appreciate that. And also just wanted to quickly ask, and so it's a little bit unclear in your mind, Captain Salas, Captain Schindele, that these filters that came in the '70s that were described here today, that they could have been brought forth by the Air Force because they were finally getting to something they felt had occurred as early as the 19--or that they knew about as early as the 1950s or something they might have experienced from the testimony.
→ {"text": "好的。我感謝這一點。我也只是想快速問一下，所以在你們心中有點不清楚，薩拉斯上尉、Schindele 上尉，今天在這裡描述的這些在 70 年代出現的過濾器，它們可能是空軍提出的，因為他們終於開始處理他們認為早在 19——或者他們早在 1950 年代就知道的事情，或者從證詞中可能經歷過的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. Because they've also been what you had told them, either one maybe. Or is that-- Well, I know I'm kind of into the weeds on this a little bit, and I apologize for that, but I just wanted to know whether--I mean, it really struck me when I heard Captain Fenstermacher the shields and the filters, that they had to have believed your testimonies and what you said you saw that day. They had to know that something was definitely happening, and then to keep this silent for 46 years as we've talked about.
→ {"text": "因為它們也是你們告訴他們的東西，可能是其中之一。或者那是——嗯，我知道我在這方面有點陷入細節了，我為此道歉，但我只是想知道是否——我是說，當我聽到芬斯特馬赫上尉談到屏蔽和過濾器時，我真的感到震驚，他們必須相信你們的證詞以及你們說你們那天看到的東西。他們必須知道確實有事情發生，然後像我們談到的那樣，將此保持沉默 46 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. You know, I wasn't sure about this whole truth embargo even a few days ago, but this truth embargo indeed needs to start coming down.
→ {"text": "你知道，即使在幾天前，我對這整個真相禁運還不確定，但這個真相禁運確實需要開始瓦解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. The document that Bob Salas had released was very lengthy, really, with three sub-documents, and I spent a lot of time scanning it. And in fact, there was a little piece about UFOs.
→ {"text": "Bob Salas 公布的文件確實非常冗長，有三個子文件，我花了很多時間掃描它。事實上，裡面有一小段關於 UFO 的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. What it was was a technical explanation of all the echo sites and what happened at each of the sites in the first document. And there was a little piece about UFOs, and it said, "The rumor of any UFO creating this is disproved, just disowned." Disowned, I think, wasn't it?
→ {"text": "它是對所有回音站點以及第一份文件中每個站點發生的事情的技術解釋。有一小段關於 UFO 的內容，它說：「任何 UFO 造成這件事的謠言都被證偽了，只是被否認了。」是否認，我想，不是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. It was disproven.
→ {"text": "是被證偽。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. The rumor was disproven. Now, I don't know how you disprove a rumor.
→ {"text": "謠言被證偽了。現在，我不知道你如何證偽一個謠言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. But at the very end document, it was a '68 document where they talked about they were concerned with how EMF affected it, and that Boeing was going to work on the EMF problem.
→ {"text": "但在最後的文件中，那是一份 68 年的文件，他們談到他們擔心電磁力如何影響它，波音公司將要處理電磁力問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. And I think what we installed was the result of his echo and Oscar flight and not his testimony, because it didn't happen.
→ {"text": "我認為我們安裝的東西是他的回音和 Oscar 飛行的結果，而不是他的證詞，因為它沒有發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. They didn't believe him.
→ {"text": "他們不相信他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. Just because they said they didn't believe him doesn't mean they didn't believe him.
→ {"text": "僅僅因為他們說他們不相信他，並不意味著他們不相信他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. Yeah, but the technical aspects, they couldn't say it didn't happen, because the flight had all these errors, and this is what happened.
→ {"text": "是的，但從技術方面來說，他們無法說它沒有發生，因為飛行出現了所有這些錯誤，這就是發生的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. I think you're being very humble, Mr. Captain, and all of you, because you probably create a lot more technology than you believe, or that you even are willing to talk about.
→ {"text": "我認為你們非常謙虛，上尉先生，以及你們所有人，因為你們可能創造的技術比你們相信的，或者甚至願意談論的要多得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. Thank you very much, Congressman.
→ {"text": "非常感謝您，眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
