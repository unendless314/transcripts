## Speaker Group 1

85. I've had an opportunity to visit three or four aircraft carriers that a hundred or more planes can fly off of in my defense experience and the young men and women on ship who, nuclear submarines I might ask, aircraft carriers as well as nuclear submarines, I've seen the nukes lined up on the submarine, I don't know, 1,500 deep look like in rows.
→ {"text": "在我的國防經歷中，我有機會訪問過三、四艘航空母艦，那些可以讓一百多架飛機起飛的航艦，還有艦上的年輕男女，我也參觀過核潛艇，航空母艦以及核潛艇，我見過潛艇上排列整齊的核武器，我不知道，看起來大概有一千五百枚，一排排的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. We are supposedly the defense country of the world. If there's something in our atmosphere in the world that may question that, it seems to me, this member, that we need to take a look at it. If they wanted to blow us up, seems like they'd have done it 20, 30, 40 years ago. Maybe they want to coexist, but to not even begin to, whatever, you guys got more intelligence than I have. It's just the wrong way. I mean, there won't be a world.
→ {"text": "我們理應是世界的防禦國家。如果我們的大氣層中、世界上有什麼東西可能對此提出質疑，在我這個委員看來，我們需要對此進行調查。如果它們想要炸毀我們，似乎在二、三、四十年前就已經做了。也許它們想要共存，但甚至不去嘗試，無論如何，你們比我有更多的情報。這就是錯誤的做法。我的意思是，將不會有一個世界。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句子稍顯複雜，口語表達"}

87. Who wants that?
→ {"text": "誰會想要那樣？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. Then my last one at this time would be the press, the press, very, very powerful. Do any of you know of any occasions where the press might have been, I don't know, caused to go one way or the other? Positive or make joke of it or all? Captain Salas?
→ {"text": "那麼我此時最後一個問題是關於媒體，媒體，非常、非常有影響力。你們是否知道任何媒體可能被，我不知道，促使往某個方向報導的情況？正面報導或嘲笑它或所有情況？Salas 上尉？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "口語化表達，略微不完整"}

89. Thank you, Ms. Gilpatrick. In 2004, I was contacted by the Peter Jennings group who's putting together a UFO special and flown to Dallas, Texas for about two or three days.
→ {"text": "謝謝，吉爾派翠克女士。2004 年，我被正在製作不明飛行物特輯的彼得·詹寧斯團隊聯繫，並飛往德州達拉斯待了大約兩、三天。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Peter Jennings, Ms. Gilpatrick"}

90. They interviewed me for a couple of days, got a lot of footage, said I had great testimony and they were going to feature my testimony on their special. With a week before that special, the Peter Jennings special on UFOs was to be broadcast. I got a call saying that they couldn't, they wouldn't be using my interview. There are other members here in the audience that were also interviewed for this. To me, they gave me no reason. I'm just suspicious that somebody got to them and did not want this story out.
→ {"text": "他們採訪了我好幾天，拍攝了大量鏡頭，說我的證詞很精彩，他們將在特輯中重點呈現我的證詞。在該特輯，也就是彼得·詹寧斯的不明飛行物特輯即將播出的前一週，我接到一通電話說他們無法使用、不會使用我的採訪。在場的觀眾中也有其他人接受了這次採訪。對我來說，他們沒有給我任何理由。我只是懷疑有人找上了他們，不希望這個故事被報導出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. Anyone else have any press? Before we go to the members, does anyone else at the table like to make a final statement as we go through? It may not be your final because we're going to interact a little bit longer, but if you want to add something at this point, otherwise I'll go right. Mr. Scott, Sergeant Scott?
→ {"text": "還有其他人有媒體經驗嗎？在我們轉向委員之前，在座的各位是否還有人想在這個過程中做最後陳述？這可能不是你們的最後發言，因為我們還會再互動一段時間，但如果你們現在想補充什麼，否則我就繼續了。Scott 先生，Scott 中士？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. I'd like to see the military and the local police be able to have their people, if they see a sighting or respond to a sighting, to be able to give an honest report of it. Because if it's a lie, if it's a joke and that, it's very easy to find that out quickly. If it's not, then what we're doing is gathering more intelligence information on a possible friend out there or a possible enemy. The more information we gather, the better it is for us. Right now the police department, my brother's a retired policeman, they would send a rookie cop out to investigate. They didn't want to do it. They would laugh about it. But once he found out I was coming here, then he got more serious after all these years and they told me he believed also.
→ {"text": "我希望看到軍方和地方警察能夠讓他們的人員，如果他們看到目擊事件或回應目擊事件，能夠誠實地報告。因為如果那是謊言，如果那是玩笑之類的，很容易就能快速查明。如果不是，那麼我們所做的就是收集更多關於可能的朋友或可能的敵人的情報資訊。我們收集的資訊越多，對我們越有利。現在警察局，我哥哥是一名退休警察，他們會派一名菜鳥警察去調查。他們不想做這件事。他們會嘲笑這件事。但一旦他發現我要來這裡，在這麼多年之後他變得更認真了，他們告訴我他也相信了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Sighting"}

93. Very good. Thank you. Are you hearing, sir? Okay. Let me then open it up to our members for our final or we can have some dialogue for a little while. Let me start with Councilman Bartlett.
→ {"text": "非常好。謝謝。先生，您聽得到嗎？好的。那麼讓我向我們的委員開放發言，進行最後陳述，或者我們可以再對話一會兒。讓我從巴特利特議員開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Councilman Bartlett"}

94. Thank you. I've been looking at some of the press clippings from yesterday's session and the government has been quite successful in relegating this issue to the lunatic fringe.
→ {"text": "謝謝。我一直在看昨天會議的一些媒體剪報，政府在將這個議題貶為瘋子邊緣方面相當成功。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. I have several articles. I'm going to comment on only one of them and I really don't know where it played. It says the mock Congress hearing on aliens is heavy on real-life Mulders and not Scullies. I didn't know who Mulders and Scullies were until I read it. But apparently in the X-Files, Agent Fox Mulder believes in all things, little green men, Roswell men in black, whatever, and Agent Dana Sculley believes in science. Sculley forces Mulder to find hard evidence that there's a massive conspiracy to cover up aliens' existence.
→ {"text": "我有幾篇文章。我只會評論其中一篇，我真的不知道它刊登在哪裡。文章說，模擬國會的外星人聽證會充滿了現實生活中的穆德，而非史考莉。我在讀到這篇文章之前不知道穆德和史考莉是誰。但顯然在《X檔案》中，Fox Mulder 探員相信所有事情，小綠人、羅斯威爾、黑衣人，隨便什麼，而 Dana Sculley 探員相信科學。史考莉迫使穆德找到確鑿證據，證明存在掩蓋外星人存在的大規模陰謀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Mulders and Scullies, X-Files, Roswell"}

96. The problem with this week's alien panel, that we're an alien panel now, at the National Press Club is that any of the participating members of Congress who might nationally be a Scully have been incented to suspend their disbelief because the Citizen Hearing Foundation is paying them $20,000 plus expenses to listen to the testimony. That's just insulting that we can be bought for $20,000. That's ridiculous. It goes on to say that panelists, and I mention the panelists and I'm one of the panelists, and former member Roscoe Bartlett, in an opening statement, Bartlett said he hadn't fulfilled his duty in office by failing to hold hearings on extraterrestrials. I never said that. What I had said was that the Congress, I a part of it, had failed in its responsibility to respond to the constitutional requirement that we had a responsibility to respond to people to petition their government for a
→ {"text": "本週在國家新聞俱樂部舉行的外星人小組，我們現在是外星人小組了，問題在於任何原本可能扮演史考莉角色的參與國會議員都被激勵暫停懷疑，因為公民聽證會基金會支付他們兩萬美元加上費用來聆聽證詞。說我們可以被兩萬美元收買，這簡直是侮辱。這太荒謬了。文章繼續說小組成員，我提到小組成員，我就是小組成員之一，前議員羅斯科·巴特利特在開幕陳述中說，巴特利特表示他未能履行職責，因為他在任內未能就外星人舉行聽證會。我從未這麼說。我所說的是，國會，我是其中一員，未能履行回應憲法要求的責任，即我們有責任回應人民向其政府請願要求", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: National Press Club, Citizen Hearing Foundation, Roscoe Bartlett。段落未完，等待下一段"}

97. redress of grievances. It's in the First Amendment. It's very clear. I never said that I believed in extraterrestrials. I believe that there are sightings out there that cannot be easily explained away. That is one of the possible explanations of them. There may be others.
→ {"text": "申冤的責任。這在第一修正案中。非常清楚。我從未說過我相信外星人。我相信有些目擊事件無法輕易被解釋掉。這是對它們的一種可能解釋。可能還有其他解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. But I never made that statement. Compounding the problem of eyebrow-raising testimonies that several of these politicians have reputations for being a little wacky.
→ {"text": "但我從未做出那樣的陳述。令人側目的證詞問題更加複雜的是，這些政治人物中有幾位以有點古怪而聞名。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. What does that end? Who said that? I don't know. Who said that? Who wrote it?
→ {"text": "那結尾是什麼意思？誰說的？我不知道。誰說的？誰寫的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. I don't know. You tell me. No, no. Who's it from? What network of paper?
→ {"text": "我不知道。你告訴我。不，不。這是哪裡來的？哪個網路或報紙？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. I don't know. I can't tell you. This is the article. You tell me where it came from.
→ {"text": "我不知道。我無法告訴你。這就是那篇文章。你告訴我它從哪裡來的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

102. It's terrible. It's terrible. Yeah. I want to read on. This is why I'm wacky. Bartlett has warned of the dangers of an electromagnetic pulse, a theoretical nuclear blast in space that would fry electrical circuits and kill the Internet. This is not theoretical.
→ {"text": "太糟糕了。太糟糕了。是的。我想繼續讀下去。這就是為什麼我很古怪。巴特利特警告過電磁脈衝的危險，一種理論上的太空核爆炸，會炸毀電路並癱瘓互聯網。這不是理論性的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: electromagnetic pulse"}

103. We did precisely that in 1962 over at Johnson Island. It's called Starfish Prime, and it shut down – we didn't have any electronics in '62. It shut down electrical equipment in Hawaii 800 miles away. The Congress set up an EMP commission. It functioned for eight years for four congresses. It was chaired by Dr. Bill Graham, the science advisor to President Reagan. Johnny Foster was on it, the father of most of our nuclear weapons.
→ {"text": "我們在 1962 年在約翰遜島就精確地做了這件事。它叫做海星計畫，它關閉了——我們在 1962 年還沒有任何電子設備。它關閉了 800 英里外夏威夷的電氣設備。國會成立了一個 EMP 委員會。它運作了八年，經歷了四屆國會。它由雷根總統的科學顧問 Bill Graham 博士主持。Johnny Foster 也在其中，他是我們大部分核武器之父。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Johnson Island, Starfish Prime, EMP commission"}

104. Dr. Joan Woodard was on it. She is the deputy director at Sandia Labs. And Dr. Lowell Wood from Lawrence Livermore was on it. This is the person that Tom Clancy told me, and his view was the smartest man hired by the U.S. government. That commission functioned for eight years. As a result of their functioning, the Pentagon has set up a permanent commission of permanent panel task force on EMP. John Kyle has made a statement that says that this is one of the few – as a matter of fact, I think it's the only event I know of – that could end us as a sovereign nation. You can read his comment on that.
→ {"text": "Joan Woodard 博士也在其中。她是桑迪亞國家實驗室的副主任。來自勞倫斯利福摩爾國家實驗室的 Lowell Wood 博士也在其中。Tom Clancy 告訴我這個人，在他看來是美國政府聘用的最聰明的人。該委員會運作了八年。由於他們的工作，五角大廈成立了一個關於 EMP 的常設委員會或常設小組特別工作組。John Kyle 發表聲明說，這是少數幾個——事實上，我認為這是我所知道的唯一一個——可能終結我們作為主權國家的事件。你可以閱讀他對此的評論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. You know, I'm just insulted that the press does this. You know, these statements have no basis in reality. And I want to point out something else, how successful they've been.
→ {"text": "你知道，媒體這樣做讓我感到受辱。你知道，這些陳述沒有任何現實依據。我想指出另一件事，他們有多麼成功。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. Here is a fact sheet that is put out by the Air Force. And it's about Unidentified Flying Objects and Air Force Project Blue Book. They did everything they could to debunk 12,800 – 618 sightings, but 701 of them they could not find any way to rationalize it away. That's a pretty large number. And then they make two statements. You know, one thing they say is that there was never any indication of threat to our national security. Then why in heck the classification, the secret classification, that there's no threat to our security?
→ {"text": "這是空軍發布的事實說明書。它是關於不明飛行物和空軍藍皮書計畫。他們盡一切努力揭穿 12,618 次目擊事件，但其中 701 次他們找不到任何方法來合理化解釋。這是一個相當大的數字。然後他們做了兩個陳述。你知道，他們說的一件事是從未有任何跡象表明對我們國家安全構成威脅。那麼為什麼還要機密分類，秘密分類，如果對我們的安全沒有威脅？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Air Force Project Blue Book, National Security"}

107. Most of these things are just mutually exclusive, aren't they? You can't say one and then not – and then say the other. They said there was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as unidentified represented technology developed – developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge. It reminds me of Goebbels in his statement, "Just say it often enough, no matter how big the lie and people will soon believe it." We have radar tracks. We have radar tracks showing that these objects, whatever they are, behave in ways that known aircraft of no country in the world can do. That just isn't true. There was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified were extraterrestrial vehicles. That's true. But there is a lot of evidence – but there was a lot of evidence – that they couldn't be anything that
→ {"text": "這些事情大多數都是相互矛盾的，不是嗎？你不能說一件事，然後不——然後又說另一件事。他們說，沒有證據提交給空軍或被空軍發現，證明被歸類為不明的目擊事件代表了超出現代科學知識範圍的技術發展或原理。這讓我想起戈培爾的聲明，「只要說得夠多，無論謊言有多大，人們很快就會相信。」我們有雷達追蹤。我們有雷達追蹤顯示這些物體，無論它們是什麼，以世界上任何國家的已知飛行器都無法做到的方式行動。那根本不是真的。沒有證據表明被歸類為不明的目擊事件是外星飛行器。這是真的。但有很多證據——但有很多證據——證明它們不可能是任何", "confidence": "high", "notes": "terminology.yaml: extraterrestrial。段落未完，等待下一段"}

108. is publicized by either our country or by Russia or by China. China is now entering as a player in this – in this domain. I'm generally a pretty quiet individual, but you know, this press – this press stuff is just clear – clearly outrageous. The audacity and the ignorance of something like that just infuriates me.

109. (Applause.)

110. And then this same press that is ridiculing what we're doing today is totally silent when the Air Force puts out a fact sheet like this that is anything but a fact sheet because there are statements on it that are clearly, clearly not true. You know, this – there has to be an accountability for this, does there not? Thank you for holding this hearing.
→ {"text": "然後這些今天嘲笑我們所做之事的媒體，在空軍發布這樣一份根本不是事實說明書的說明書時卻完全保持沉默，因為上面有明顯、明顯不真實的陳述。你知道，這個——必須有人為此負責，不是嗎？謝謝你們舉辦這場聽證會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. Well, I have a thought. And the thought is, once there can be disclosure about what is out there and what is coming in and an understanding, which will take certainly hearings within the Congress and in the House and the Senate. But we have a big question, and that question is, are we doing this because we are going to arm space? And you know, let's just talk about getting rid of humanity in general. One more war, but it's up there in space.
→ {"text": "嗯，我有一個想法。這個想法是，一旦能夠揭露那裡有什麼以及正在進入什麼，並達成理解，這當然需要在國會、眾議院和參議院內舉行聽證會。但我們有一個大問題，這個問題是，我們這樣做是因為我們要武裝太空嗎？你知道，讓我們來談談總體上擺脫人類。再來一場戰爭，但這次是在太空中。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "terminology.yaml: Disclosure。「擺脫人類」可能指「消滅人類」或「人類滅亡」"}

117. We don't want to do that. And I just think this is the sneaky way to get there by not admitting that there's all of this challenge out there. And I honestly believe that the visitors, the UFOs, have shown us what they can do. I mean, they can turn off full nuclear sites. And they don't have -- that's probably why we have seen less and less recently because they've done what -- you know, if humans can't figure out what they're capable of, then there's no -- they don't need to show us any other way. Because I don't -- they obviously -- they may be -- probably aren't violent, because if they were -- did what they're capable of, they'd probably be eating some of us. You know?
→ {"text": "我們不想這樣做。我只是認為這是一種狡猾的方式，透過不承認那裡存在所有這些挑戰來達到目的。我真誠地相信，訪客，這些不明飛行物，已經向我們展示了它們能做什麼。我的意思是，它們可以關閉整個核武基地。它們不需要——這可能就是為什麼我們最近看到越來越少的原因，因為它們已經做了——你知道，如果人類無法理解它們的能力，那麼就沒有——它們不需要以其他方式向我們展示。因為我不——它們顯然——它們可能——可能不是暴力的，因為如果它們是——做了它們能做的事，它們可能會吃掉我們中的一些人。你知道嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. Annihilating.

119. But they're annihilating us, yes. And we don't, you know, come on. We need to talk about this.

120. We need to be furious how the press is covering it. And they will. But thank you, everybody.

121. And we've got three more days of this, you know. So we'll be thanking, I guess, until the cows come home here. But we've got some work to do. And our world has some work to do, not just the United States of America. So thank you, Madam Chairman.
