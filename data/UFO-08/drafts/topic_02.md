## Speaker Group 1

85. I've had an opportunity to visit three or four aircraft carriers that a hundred or more planes can fly off of in my defense experience and the young men and women on ship who, nuclear submarines I might ask, aircraft carriers as well as nuclear submarines, I've seen the nukes lined up on the submarine, I don't know, 1,500 deep look like in rows.

86. We are supposedly the defense country of the world. If there's something in our atmosphere in the world that may question that, it seems to me, this member, that we need to take a look at it. If they wanted to blow us up, seems like they'd have done it 20, 30, 40 years ago. Maybe they want to coexist, but to not even begin to, whatever, you guys got more intelligence than I have. It's just the wrong way. I mean, there won't be a world.

87. Who wants that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. Then my last one at this time would be the press, the press, very, very powerful. Do any of you know of any occasions where the press might have been, I don't know, caused to go one way or the other? Positive or make joke of it or all? Captain Salas?

89. Thank you, Ms. Gilpatrick. In 2004, I was contacted by the Peter Jennings group who's putting together a UFO special and flown to Dallas, Texas for about two or three days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. They interviewed me for a couple of days, got a lot of footage, said I had great testimony and they were going to feature my testimony on their special. With a week before that special, the Peter Jennings special on UFOs was to be broadcast. I got a call saying that they couldn't, they wouldn't be using my interview. There are other members here in the audience that were also interviewed for this. To me, they gave me no reason. I'm just suspicious that somebody got to them and did not want this story out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. Anyone else have any press? Before we go to the members, does anyone else at the table like to make a final statement as we go through? It may not be your final because we're going to interact a little bit longer, but if you want to add something at this point, otherwise I'll go right. Mr. Scott, Sergeant Scott?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. I'd like to see the military and the local police be able to have their people, if they see a sighting or respond to a sighting, to be able to give an honest report of it. Because if it's a lie, if it's a joke and that, it's very easy to find that out quickly. If it's not, then what we're doing is gathering more intelligence information on a possible friend out there or a possible enemy. The more information we gather, the better it is for us. Right now the police department, my brother's a retired policeman, they would send a rookie cop out to investigate. They didn't want to do it. They would laugh about it. But once he found out I was coming here, then he got more serious after all these years and they told me he believed also.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. Very good. Thank you. Are you hearing, sir? Okay. Let me then open it up to our members for our final or we can have some dialogue for a little while. Let me start with Councilman Bartlett.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. Thank you. I've been looking at some of the press clippings from yesterday's session and the government has been quite successful in relegating this issue to the lunatic fringe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. I have several articles. I'm going to comment on only one of them and I really don't know where it played. It says the mock Congress hearing on aliens is heavy on real-life Mulders and not Scullies. I didn't know who Mulders and Scullies were until I read it. But apparently in the X-Files, Agent Fox Mulder believes in all things, little green men, Roswell men in black, whatever, and Agent Dana Sculley believes in science. Sculley forces Mulder to find hard evidence that there's a massive conspiracy to cover up aliens' existence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. The problem with this week's alien panel, that we're an alien panel now, at the National Press Club is that any of the participating members of Congress who might nationally be a Scully have been incented to suspend their disbelief because the Citizen Hearing Foundation is paying them $20,000 plus expenses to listen to the testimony. That's just insulting that we can be bought for $20,000. That's ridiculous. It goes on to say that panelists, and I mention the panelists and I'm one of the panelists, and former member Roscoe Bartlett, in an opening statement, Bartlett said he hadn't fulfilled his duty in office by failing to hold hearings on extraterrestrials. I never said that. What I had said was that the Congress, I a part of it, had failed in its responsibility to respond to the constitutional requirement that we had a responsibility to respond to people to petition their government for a

97. redress of grievances. It's in the First Amendment. It's very clear. I never said that I believed in extraterrestrials. I believe that there are sightings out there that cannot be easily explained away. That is one of the possible explanations of them. There may be others.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. But I never made that statement. Compounding the problem of eyebrow-raising testimonies that several of these politicians have reputations for being a little wacky.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. What does that end? Who said that? I don't know. Who said that? Who wrote it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. I don't know. You tell me. No, no. Who's it from? What network of paper?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. I don't know. I can't tell you. This is the article. You tell me where it came from.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. It's terrible. It's terrible. Yeah. I want to read on. This is why I'm wacky. Bartlett has warned of the dangers of an electromagnetic pulse, a theoretical nuclear blast in space that would fry electrical circuits and kill the Internet. This is not theoretical.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. We did precisely that in 1962 over at Johnson Island. It's called Starfish Prime, and it shut down – we didn't have any electronics in '62. It shut down electrical equipment in Hawaii 800 miles away. The Congress set up an EMP commission. It functioned for eight years for four congresses. It was chaired by Dr. Bill Graham, the science advisor to President Reagan. Johnny Foster was on it, the father of most of our nuclear weapons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. Dr. Joan Woodard was on it. She is the deputy director at Sandia Labs. And Dr. Lowell Wood from Lawrence Livermore was on it. This is the person that Tom Clancy told me, and his view was the smartest man hired by the U.S. government. That commission functioned for eight years. As a result of their functioning, the Pentagon has set up a permanent commission of permanent panel task force on EMP. John Kyle has made a statement that says that this is one of the few – as a matter of fact, I think it's the only event I know of – that could end us as a sovereign nation. You can read his comment on that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. You know, I'm just insulted that the press does this. You know, these statements have no basis in reality. And I want to point out something else, how successful they've been.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. Here is a fact sheet that is put out by the Air Force. And it's about Unidentified Flying Objects and Air Force Project Blue Book. They did everything they could to debunk 12,800 – 618 sightings, but 701 of them they could not find any way to rationalize it away. That's a pretty large number. And then they make two statements. You know, one thing they say is that there was never any indication of threat to our national security. Then why in heck the classification, the secret classification, that there's no threat to our security?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. Most of these things are just mutually exclusive, aren't they? You can't say one and then not – and then say the other. They said there was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as unidentified represented technology developed – developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge. It reminds me of Goebbels in his statement, "Just say it often enough, no matter how big the lie and people will soon believe it." We have radar tracks. We have radar tracks showing that these objects, whatever they are, behave in ways that known aircraft of no country in the world can do. That just isn't true. There was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified were extraterrestrial vehicles. That's true. But there is a lot of evidence – but there was a lot of evidence – that they couldn't be anything that
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. is publicized by either our country or by Russia or by China. China is now entering as a player in this – in this domain. I'm generally a pretty quiet individual, but you know, this press – this press stuff is just clear – clearly outrageous. The audacity and the ignorance of something like that just infuriates me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. And then this same press that is ridiculing what we're doing today is totally silent when the Air Force puts out a fact sheet like this that is anything but a fact sheet because there are statements on it that are clearly, clearly not true. You know, this – there has to be an accountability for this, does there not? Thank you for holding this hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. Thank you. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. Congresswoman Woolsey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. Well, I have a thought. And the thought is, once there can be disclosure about what is out there and what is coming in and an understanding, which will take certainly hearings within the Congress and in the House and the Senate. But we have a big question, and that question is, are we doing this because we are going to arm space? And you know, let's just talk about getting rid of humanity in general. One more war, but it's up there in space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. We don't want to do that. And I just think this is the sneaky way to get there by not admitting that there's all of this challenge out there. And I honestly believe that the visitors, the UFOs, have shown us what they can do. I mean, they can turn off full nuclear sites. And they don't have -- that's probably why we have seen less and less recently because they've done what -- you know, if humans can't figure out what they're capable of, then there's no -- they don't need to show us any other way. Because I don't -- they obviously -- they may be -- probably aren't violent, because if they were -- did what they're capable of, they'd probably be eating some of us. You know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. Annihilating.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. But they're annihilating us, yes. And we don't, you know, come on. We need to talk about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. We need to be furious how the press is covering it. And they will. But thank you, everybody.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. And we've got three more days of this, you know. So we'll be thanking, I guess, until the cows come home here. But we've got some work to do. And our world has some work to do, not just the United States of America. So thank you, Madam Chairman.
