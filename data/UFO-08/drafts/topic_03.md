122. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. Senator?
→ {"text": "參議員？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. Well, I'm sorry I ruined his afternoon, because I brought the press stuff to his attention. [laughter] It's garbage. I mean, it's garbage. But does that surprise you? I would ask one question on the Peter Jennings. Did they go on with the show?
→ {"text": "嗯，我很抱歉毀了他的下午，因為我把媒體報導拿給他看。（笑聲）那是垃圾。我的意思是，那真是垃圾。但這讓你驚訝嗎？我想問一個關於 Peter Jennings 的問題。他們有繼續播出那個節目嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Peter Jennings 保留原文"}

125. Yes, sir, they did.
→ {"text": "是的，先生，他們播了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. They just took you out.
→ {"text": "他們只是把你剪掉了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. They just took me out. And I think -- Did they have any good evidence in the show at all?
→ {"text": "他們就是把我剪掉了。而且我認為——那個節目裡有任何有力的證據嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. Not in my opinion.
→ {"text": "在我看來沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. Good.
→ {"text": "很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. I mean, that's par for the course for mainstream media. He brought to my attention, so he's ruining my afternoon. This is the fact sheet put out by the government. There is no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified were extraterrestrial. What else could they be? There's no -- I mean -- and this, I think -- I want to hit a couple of you on this.
→ {"text": "我是說，這對主流媒體來說是意料中事。他把這拿給我看，所以毀了我的下午。這是政府發布的事實說明書。沒有證據顯示被歸類為不明的目擊事件是外星的。那它們還能是什麼？沒有——我是說——而這點，我認為——我想就這點問你們幾個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "extraterrestrial 譯為「外星的」，符合 terminology.yaml"}

131. You know, you could say, "Well, we're skeptical." Sure, I'm skeptical of everything. But by the same token, if there's no other rational reason for something, you have to come to a conclusion. And the conclusion I can share with you, which is just logic, is if there's anything in this whole compendium of knowledge of UFOs, it's got to be what happened at Minot and Wyoming and so forth. What's been proven is that somebody out there, extraterrestrial, can shut off our defense capability just like that. Just like that. Now, how do you think that makes the people in Congress who are appropriating billions and billions of dollars for a defense system that doesn't work if you really push the shove?
→ {"text": "你知道，你可以說「嗯，我們持懷疑態度。」當然，我對所有事情都抱持懷疑。但同樣地，如果某件事沒有其他合理的解釋，你就必須得出結論。而我可以與你們分享的結論，純粹基於邏輯，就是如果在整個 UFO 知識彙編中有任何真實的事件，那必定是發生在邁諾特空軍基地和懷俄明州等地的事件。已經被證實的是，外太空的某個存在，外星的存在，能夠就這樣關閉我們的防禦能力。就這樣。現在，你認為這會讓國會那些撥款數十億美元用於防禦系統的人作何感想？如果真的面對緊急情況時，這個系統根本不管用？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Minot 譯為「邁諾特空軍基地」，extraterrestrial 譯為「外星的」，均符合 terminology.yaml"}

132. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "（掌聲。）", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. And so if there's ever a rationale for the government in cahoots with the military-industrial complex to defend the appropriation process that feeds them, it's got to be what's been discovered and they've got to put a lid on this. I mean, this makes these -- all this wealth obsolete. I'll give you an example of what happened recently. It happened in Alaska.
→ {"text": "因此，如果政府與軍工複合體勾結，為了保護養活他們的撥款程序而需要一個理由，那必然就是這些已經被發現的事情，而他們必須壓制這件事。我的意思是，這讓這些——所有這些財富都變得過時了。我給你們舉個最近發生的例子。發生在阿拉斯加。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "military-industrial complex 譯為「軍工複合體」，符合 terminology.yaml"}

134. You know, we've got these silos in Alaska. We've got 16 of them. And, of course, nobody's proven that they work, except the phony testing that's been done. Now, as soon as this -- we had this craze with North Korea. What happened? They appropriated money for another 14 silos.
→ {"text": "你知道，我們在阿拉斯加有這些飛彈發射井。我們有 16 個。當然，除了那些虛假的測試之外，沒有人證明它們真的有用。現在，一旦這個——我們有這個對北韓的恐慌。發生了什麼事？他們又撥款建造另外 14 個發射井。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. That will make 13 silos to go after North Korea. And I don't know if any of you know the defense concept. It's more expensive to build a shield than to build a spear. So you build all the shields you want. All they do is have more spears to get by your shields.
→ {"text": "這樣就有 13 個發射井用來對付北韓。我不知道你們當中有沒有人了解防禦概念。建造盾牌比建造長矛更昂貴。所以你想建多少盾牌都可以。他們只需要製造更多長矛來突破你的盾牌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. So this is the first thing I learned in one of the hearings on this subject. So it doesn't take -- you have to go very far to realize that what we have here is the goods of why the simple, simple rational formulation that this threatens the entire Defense Department's capability. And so deny it. It doesn't happen. It doesn't exist. Anybody talks about it, they're idiots. And so the press goes along with this. And we go back to our conclusion of yesterday. You know, I tried to conclude that we have a country ruled by juntas, military juntas and corporations in cahoots with our corporations. But what's been raised, and I hate to monopolize it on -- but maybe this afternoon is going to go too fast, but stop and think what we've concluded. That we're supposed to -- now, we didn't take an oath here. You took an oath. We didn't take an oath. But obviously you assume that all politicians
→ {"text": "這是我在某次關於這個主題的聽證會上學到的第一件事。所以你不需要——你不必走太遠就能意識到，我們這裡掌握的就是為什麼要用這個簡單、簡單的理性說法來否認的原因，即這威脅到整個國防部的能力。所以就否認它。它沒有發生。它不存在。任何談論它的人都是白痴。於是媒體也就配合這一套。我們回到昨天的結論。你知道，我試圖得出結論，我們的國家是由軍政府、軍事集團和與我們企業勾結的公司所統治的。但已經提出的問題，我不想壟斷這個話題——但也許今天下午會過得太快，但停下來想想我們得出了什麼結論。我們應該——現在，我們沒有在這裡宣誓。你們宣過誓。我們沒有宣誓。但顯然你們假設所有政治人物", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "段落語句較長且口語化，翻譯保留原文語氣與結構"}

137. are truthful. Well, that's a fair sum. But let me point out to you that the hope is, is that we will go back to members of Congress and try to persuade them as to the knowledge that we've acquired. Well, I for one will confess, I don't know anybody in a sense that I could approach that could give me five minutes' time on this particular subject, before or after the hearing. But what this hearing has done is not so much that it's going to persuade Congress. It's a first step to persuading the American public, or getting information out to the public. And that's where I think the great benefit and the contribution made with this hearing. But I just want to add one thing, and I'll follow through on it tomorrow or the day after. And that is, it's fine. We can educate the public. But does the public have any power to act on this new knowledge that they have? I don't see that. All they
→ {"text": "都是誠實的。嗯，這是個合理的假設。但讓我向你們指出，我們的希望是，我們會回到國會議員那裡，試圖說服他們接受我們獲得的知識。嗯，就我而言，我坦白說，在某種意義上我不認識任何人，無論在聽證會前後，我能找到誰願意在這個特定主題上給我五分鐘的時間。但這次聽證會所做的，與其說是要說服國會，不如說是說服美國公眾的第一步，或者是向公眾傳遞資訊。我認為這就是這次聽證會帶來的巨大利益和貢獻所在。但我只想補充一件事，我會在明天或後天繼續探討。那就是，這很好。我們可以教育公眾。但公眾有任何權力根據他們擁有的這些新知識採取行動嗎？我看不到。他們所能做的", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "段落較長且口語化，保留原文語氣"}

138. can do on election day is vote for people like us, who when we're there don't pay attention to this. This is the problem we have. So I leave it at that. I was going to ask about the $20,000. They're complaining about $20,000. This is five days, eight hours for five days.
→ {"text": "只能在選舉日投票給像我們這樣的人，而我們在位時卻不關注這件事。這就是我們面臨的問題。我就說到這裡。我本來想問關於那兩萬美元的事。他們在抱怨兩萬美元。這是五天，每天八小時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. When the likes of these pundits go out and speak, they get $30,000 for an hour. They get $100,000 for an hour and a half. I mean, it's ridiculous that it took, that this is raised by, and it was raised in an interview. Somebody raised it with me. And I says, "Well, what do you get paid when you're out on a stump?" This was somebody from Fox. And he confessed. $25,000, $30,000 is what he gets for an hour. And we're putting in 40 hours here. So we're underpaid, if anything, based upon the knowledge that we have.
→ {"text": "當這些評論家出去演講時，他們一小時能拿到三萬美元。他們一個半小時能拿到十萬美元。我的意思是，這太荒謬了，這個問題被提出來，而且是在一次訪談中提出的。有人向我提這個問題。我說：「嗯，你在演講台上演講時能拿多少錢？」這是 Fox 的某個人。他承認了。他一小時拿兩萬五千美元到三萬美元。而我們在這裡投入了 40 個小時。所以根據我們擁有的知識，如果有什麼的話，我們的報酬太低了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Fox 保留原文（指 Fox News）"}

140. So I think we've concluded the reason for the cover-up. And that's really what we discovered today, this afternoon, was that somebody can shut off our defense just like that. And it's an embarrassment to the Air Force. It's an embarrassment to the federal government. It's an embarrassment to the Congress. And, of course, nobody wants to face that embarrassment.
→ {"text": "所以我認為我們已經得出了真相掩蓋的原因。而這正是我們今天下午所發現的，就是有某個存在能夠就這樣關閉我們的防禦系統。這讓空軍難堪。這讓聯邦政府難堪。這讓國會難堪。當然，沒有人願意面對這種難堪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "cover-up 譯為「真相掩蓋」，符合 terminology.yaml"}

141. That I yield. I reserve the balance of my time in case I want to come back.
→ {"text": "我讓出發言權。我保留剩餘時間，以防我想再發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. That's right. That's right. Thank you, Senator, very much.
→ {"text": "沒錯。沒錯。非常感謝您，參議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. Thank you.

144. Congresswoman Hooley?
→ {"text": "胡利女眾議員？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Congresswoman Hooley 譯為「胡利女眾議員」，符合 terminology.yaml"}

145. Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. First of all, I'd like to thank our panel. You have been terrific. And anyone that wants to jump in and answer this question, I'm originally from North Dakota. I'm very familiar with Minot. So I have a problem with understanding why anyone would go to Minot. I'm sorry. That's not a good thing. I love you, North Dakota.
→ {"text": "是的。謝謝您，主席女士。首先，我想感謝我們的證人小組。你們表現得非常好。任何想參與回答這個問題的人，我來自北達科他州。我對邁諾特非常熟悉。所以我無法理解為什麼有人會去邁諾特。我很抱歉。那不是什麼好地方。我愛你，北達科他州。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Minot 譯為「邁諾特」，符合 terminology.yaml"}

146. But wherever they come from, somebody is in Minot shutting off the missiles. Why? I mean, is that to show us that they can do that? Why would you do that?
→ {"text": "但不管他們來自哪裡，有人在邁諾特關閉了飛彈。為什麼？我的意思是，這是為了向我們展示他們能做到這一點嗎？為什麼要這樣做？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Minot 譯為「邁諾特」，符合 terminology.yaml"}

147. First of all, the world is facing a crisis right now about nuclear weapons. I don't have to remind you about those possibilities in countries that are trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we've had enough nuclear weapons to destroy every living thing on Earth for a long, long time. And it would not take much to start a nuclear war, in my opinion. And that risk is getting worse. So I do believe that -- and I think they are extraterrestrial, and this is just my opinion -- that they are here to at least point to the fact that we are on the verge of annihilation, of suicide, if you will, our own civilization. And they would like to see us get rid of these weapons. And that's a message I got from my incident.
→ {"text": "首先，世界目前正面臨核武器的危機。我不需要提醒你們那些試圖獲取核武器的國家的可能性。我們擁有足以摧毀地球上所有生物的核武器已經很長很長時間了。在我看來，引發核戰爭並不需要太多。而且這種風險正在惡化。所以我確實相信——我認為他們是外星的，這只是我的意見——他們來到這裡至少是為了指出這樣一個事實：我們正處於毀滅的邊緣，可以說是我們自己文明的自殺。他們希望看到我們擺脫這些武器。這就是我從我的事件中得到的訊息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "nuclear weapons 譯為「核武器」，extraterrestrial 譯為「外星的」，均符合 terminology.yaml"}

148. It's my own conclusion that this was strictly a message. Get rid of your weapons. Get rid of those nuclear weapons. They are not weapons of war, by the way. They're weapons of mass destruction. They would never be used in a real war, because it would just be a complete suicide for civilization, like I said.
→ {"text": "這是我自己的結論，這嚴格來說就是一個訊息。擺脫你們的武器。擺脫那些核武器。順便說一句，它們不是戰爭武器。它們是大規模毀滅性武器。它們永遠不會在真正的戰爭中使用，因為如我所說，那將是文明的完全自殺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "nuclear weapons 譯為「核武器」，符合 terminology.yaml"}

149. Anyone else want to jump in? Yes. Sergeant Scott? Yeah. In June of 2001, President Bush came on scene on ABC News, and it was carried throughout the networks and in Popular Mechanics magazine. He had with him a general from the Air Force, and he was announcing that the general was going to be the head of a new military force called the Space Force, and they were going to build this force and also put a military base on the moon. Now nobody questioned him on why. What was the purpose for that? But then September 11th comes around.
→ {"text": "還有其他人想參與嗎？有的。Scott 中士？是的。2001 年 6 月，布希總統在 ABC 新聞上露面，這則新聞被各大電視網和《大眾機械》雜誌報導。他帶著一位空軍將領，宣布這位將領將成為一支名為太空部隊的新軍事力量的首長，他們將建立這支部隊，並在月球上設立軍事基地。現在沒有人質疑他為什麼。那個目的是什麼？但隨後 911 事件發生了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Space Force 譯為「太空部隊」，符合 terminology.yaml"}

150. The terrorist attack comes. This general is posted as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Space Force never comes about. The question I have still, why did he want to create a new military force for outer space unless there's a threat? We have one. We have a space force. It's in existence. And it's been written about extensively. It's there. Okay. All right. Some acknowledge it and some don't. But your point's well taken, Sergeant. Is that the Black Ops? Black Ops, that's the real. Well, yeah, I know. You want me to answer that? No. No, I won't. No. Let me go to Congress. Oh, I'm sorry. He jumped in. Right, I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. Continuous. Your time, Congresswoman. I'd like to hear from you. I just said what he's talking about is Black Ops. And I don't doubt that.
→ {"text": "恐怖攻擊發生了。這位將領被任命為參謀長聯席會議主席，而太空部隊從未成立。我仍然有個疑問，為什麼他想要為外太空創建一支新的軍事力量，除非有威脅？我們有一支。我們有太空部隊。它已經存在了。而且已經被廣泛報導過。它就在那裡。好的。沒錯。有些人承認，有些人不承認。但你的觀點很有道理，中士。那是黑色行動嗎？黑色行動，那才是真的。嗯，是的，我知道。你要我回答嗎？不。不，我不會。不。讓我回到國會。哦，對不起。他插話了。對，對不起。你完全正確。繼續。您的時間，女眾議員。我想聽聽您的意見。我剛才說的是，他談論的是黑色行動。我對此毫不懷疑。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Joint Chiefs of Staff 譯為「參謀長聯席會議」，Space Force 譯為「太空部隊」，Black Ops 譯為「黑色行動」，均符合 terminology.yaml；段落包含多人對話，語氣較口語化"}

151. But I'm concerned that they're trying to tell us. I don't quite totally agree with Bob, but I do agree with you. That's okay. I think they're at least trying to tell us to pay attention. We have the power to do this. Be careful. And one of my, I've got scenarios in my mind about, I've thought about this an awful lot. And one of my scenarios is perhaps in fact they've communicated with the leaders of the world and said back off from this stuff, or else you're going to annihilate yourself. And maybe that's why we cut back some of our missiles. And other scenarios, do these, I'll call them beings, do these entities, are we aware of these entities enough that they can go public instead of saying you can't handle the truth, we can't handle the truth, and going public with an innocuous thing like harmless beings that are visiting us just to keep in touch and everything's fine, or
→ {"text": "但我擔心的是，他們正試圖告訴我們。我不完全同意 Bob 的看法，但我同意你的觀點。沒關係。我認為他們至少試圖告訴我們要注意。我們有能力做到這一點。小心點。我有一個，我腦海中有一些場景，我對此想了很多。我的場景之一是，也許事實上他們已經與世界領導人溝通過，並說退出這些東西，否則你們會毀滅自己。也許這就是我們削減一些飛彈的原因。還有其他場景，這些，我稱他們為生命體，這些實體，我們對這些實體的了解是否足夠讓他們能夠公開露面，而不是說你們無法承受真相，我們無法承受真相，而是公開一些無害的事情，比如有無害的生命體正在拜訪我們只是為了保持聯繫，一切都很好，或者", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "段落較長且口語化，Bob 保留原文（指證人 Bob Salas）"}

152. do they consider us a species like we consider apes a species, or dolphins, or perhaps rodents, or perhaps insects? You know, so that sort of thing I don't want to know about. If it's just the fact that they're visiting and they're kind of trying to tell us to watch out for nuclear, they can come forward with that. The government should come forward to let us know, to ease our minds a bit. However, if it's the other scenarios, I just want to come forward and lie to us and tell us the entities are nice beings and they just want to warn us about nuclear. I can't handle that truth that we're insects to these beings.
→ {"text": "他們是否把我們視為一個物種，就像我們把猿類視為一個物種，或者海豚，或者也許是齧齒動物，或者也許是昆蟲？你知道，那種事情我不想知道。如果只是因為他們在拜訪我們，並試圖告訴我們要小心核武，他們可以公開這一點。政府應該站出來讓我們知道，讓我們的心稍微安定一些。然而，如果是其他場景，我只想讓他們站出來對我們撒謊，告訴我們這些實體是友善的生命體，他們只是想警告我們關於核武的事。我無法承受我們對這些生命體來說只是昆蟲這個真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. Thank you so much. Yes, David?

155. No, I don't.

156. But these missiles being shut down, Captain Salas described two flights that he's aware of. I described to you one flight of 10 missiles that I'm aware of, but I'm also aware of other launch officers who've described to me similar situations. So, you know, it's not unique that him and I have been involved here. I mean, this was a situation that was occurring quite often when I served in 1966 and '67. And who knows that it's not still happening out there? There is no act of officers of any kind that will come out and admit that right now. But what I'd like to know is what's your speculation on these missiles being shut down?
→ {"text": "但關於這些飛彈被關閉的事，Salas 上尉描述了他所知道的兩次飛行中隊事件。我向您描述了我所知道的一次 10 枚飛彈的飛行中隊，但我也知道其他發射官員向我描述過類似的情況。所以，你知道，我和他參與其中並不是獨一無二的。我的意思是，這是我在 1966 年和 1967 年服役時經常發生的情況。誰知道現在是否還在發生？目前沒有任何軍官願意站出來承認這一點。但我想知道的是，您對這些飛彈被關閉有什麼推測？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Captain Salas 譯為「Salas 上尉」"}

161. I might have something to end on, too. Let me get -- Let me offer one very -- 30-second opinion. I feel that we really do not have enough data, even now, to know exactly why this is happening. Because despite the number of cases where this does appear to have happened, there are thousands of missiles. And not all of them have been shut down, as far as we can tell. So if they're doing this, they're obviously not doing it uniformly. And I just -- I don't really feel that any researcher who has enough data to know precisely what those motivations might be. They obviously -- they seem to have demonstrated superiority over our technology. That's for sure. So at discrete moments, they seem to be able to do this. But they're not doing it uniformly. And they certainly haven't stopped all of the massive wars that have, you know, run over the planet. So there are
