## Speaker Group 1

122. Sure.

123. Senator?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. Well, I'm sorry I ruined his afternoon, because I brought the press stuff to his attention. [laughter] It's garbage. I mean, it's garbage. But does that surprise you? I would ask one question on the Peter Jennings. Did they go on with the show?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. Yes, sir, they did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. They just took you out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. They just took me out. And I think -- Did they have any good evidence in the show at all?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. Not in my opinion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. Good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. I mean, that's par for the course for mainstream media. He brought to my attention, so he's ruining my afternoon. This is the fact sheet put out by the government. There is no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified were extraterrestrial. What else could they be? There's no -- I mean -- and this, I think -- I want to hit a couple of you on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. You know, you could say, "Well, we're skeptical." Sure, I'm skeptical of everything. But by the same token, if there's no other rational reason for something, you have to come to a conclusion. And the conclusion I can share with you, which is just logic, is if there's anything in this whole compendium of knowledge of UFOs, it's got to be what happened at Minot and Wyoming and so forth. What's been proven is that somebody out there, extraterrestrial, can shut off our defense capability just like that. Just like that. Now, how do you think that makes the people in Congress who are appropriating billions and billions of dollars for a defense system that doesn't work if you really push the shove?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. And so if there's ever a rationale for the government in cahoots with the military-industrial complex to defend the appropriation process that feeds them, it's got to be what's been discovered and they've got to put a lid on this. I mean, this makes these -- all this wealth obsolete. I'll give you an example of what happened recently. It happened in Alaska.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. You know, we've got these silos in Alaska. We've got 16 of them. And, of course, nobody's proven that they work, except the phony testing that's been done. Now, as soon as this -- we had this craze with North Korea. What happened? They appropriated money for another 14 silos.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. That will make 13 silos to go after North Korea. And I don't know if any of you know the defense concept. It's more expensive to build a shield than to build a spear. So you build all the shields you want. All they do is have more spears to get by your shields.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. So this is the first thing I learned in one of the hearings on this subject. So it doesn't take -- you have to go very far to realize that what we have here is the goods of why the simple, simple rational formulation that this threatens the entire Defense Department's capability. And so deny it. It doesn't happen. It doesn't exist. Anybody talks about it, they're idiots. And so the press goes along with this. And we go back to our conclusion of yesterday. You know, I tried to conclude that we have a country ruled by juntas, military juntas and corporations in cahoots with our corporations. But what's been raised, and I hate to monopolize it on -- but maybe this afternoon is going to go too fast, but stop and think what we've concluded. That we're supposed to -- now, we didn't take an oath here. You took an oath. We didn't take an oath. But obviously you assume that all politicians
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. are truthful. Well, that's a fair sum. But let me point out to you that the hope is, is that we will go back to members of Congress and try to persuade them as to the knowledge that we've acquired. Well, I for one will confess, I don't know anybody in a sense that I could approach that could give me five minutes' time on this particular subject, before or after the hearing. But what this hearing has done is not so much that it's going to persuade Congress. It's a first step to persuading the American public, or getting information out to the public. And that's where I think the great benefit and the contribution made with this hearing. But I just want to add one thing, and I'll follow through on it tomorrow or the day after. And that is, it's fine. We can educate the public. But does the public have any power to act on this new knowledge that they have? I don't see that. All they
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. can do on election day is vote for people like us, who when we're there don't pay attention to this. This is the problem we have. So I leave it at that. I was going to ask about the $20,000. They're complaining about $20,000. This is five days, eight hours for five days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. When the likes of these pundits go out and speak, they get $30,000 for an hour. They get $100,000 for an hour and a half. I mean, it's ridiculous that it took, that this is raised by, and it was raised in an interview. Somebody raised it with me. And I says, "Well, what do you get paid when you're out on a stump?" This was somebody from Fox. And he confessed. $25,000, $30,000 is what he gets for an hour. And we're putting in 40 hours here. So we're underpaid, if anything, based upon the knowledge that we have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. So I think we've concluded the reason for the cover-up. And that's really what we discovered today, this afternoon, was that somebody can shut off our defense just like that. And it's an embarrassment to the Air Force. It's an embarrassment to the federal government. It's an embarrassment to the Congress. And, of course, nobody wants to face that embarrassment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. That I yield. I reserve the balance of my time in case I want to come back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. That's right. That's right. Thank you, Senator, very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Congresswoman Hooley?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. First of all, I'd like to thank our panel. You have been terrific. And anyone that wants to jump in and answer this question, I'm originally from North Dakota. I'm very familiar with Minot. So I have a problem with understanding why anyone would go to Minot. I'm sorry. That's not a good thing. I love you, North Dakota.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. But wherever they come from, somebody is in Minot shutting off the missiles. Why? I mean, is that to show us that they can do that? Why would you do that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. First of all, the world is facing a crisis right now about nuclear weapons. I don't have to remind you about those possibilities in countries that are trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we've had enough nuclear weapons to destroy every living thing on Earth for a long, long time. And it would not take much to start a nuclear war, in my opinion. And that risk is getting worse. So I do believe that -- and I think they are extraterrestrial, and this is just my opinion -- that they are here to at least point to the fact that we are on the verge of annihilation, of suicide, if you will, our own civilization. And they would like to see us get rid of these weapons. And that's a message I got from my incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. It's my own conclusion that this was strictly a message. Get rid of your weapons. Get rid of those nuclear weapons. They are not weapons of war, by the way. They're weapons of mass destruction. They would never be used in a real war, because it would just be a complete suicide for civilization, like I said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. Anyone else want to jump in? Yes. Sergeant Scott? Yeah. In June of 2001, President Bush came on scene on ABC News, and it was carried throughout the networks and in Popular Mechanics magazine. He had with him a general from the Air Force, and he was announcing that the general was going to be the head of a new military force called the Space Force, and they were going to build this force and also put a military base on the moon. Now nobody questioned him on why. What was the purpose for that? But then September 11th comes around.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. The terrorist attack comes. This general is posted as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Space Force never comes about. The question I have still, why did he want to create a new military force for outer space unless there's a threat? We have one. We have a space force. It's in existence. And it's been written about extensively. It's there. Okay. All right. Some acknowledge it and some don't. But your point's well taken, Sergeant. Is that the Black Ops? Black Ops, that's the real. Well, yeah, I know. You want me to answer that? No. No, I won't. No. Let me go to Congress. Oh, I'm sorry. He jumped in. Right, I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. Continuous. Your time, Congresswoman. I'd like to hear from you. I just said what he's talking about is Black Ops. And I don't doubt that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. But I'm concerned that they're trying to tell us. I don't quite totally agree with Bob, but I do agree with you. That's okay. I think they're at least trying to tell us to pay attention. We have the power to do this. Be careful. And one of my, I've got scenarios in my mind about, I've thought about this an awful lot. And one of my scenarios is perhaps in fact they've communicated with the leaders of the world and said back off from this stuff, or else you're going to annihilate yourself. And maybe that's why we cut back some of our missiles. And other scenarios, do these, I'll call them beings, do these entities, are we aware of these entities enough that they can go public instead of saying you can't handle the truth, we can't handle the truth, and going public with an innocuous thing like harmless beings that are visiting us just to keep in touch and everything's fine, or
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. do they consider us a species like we consider apes a species, or dolphins, or perhaps rodents, or perhaps insects? You know, so that sort of thing I don't want to know about. If it's just the fact that they're visiting and they're kind of trying to tell us to watch out for nuclear, they can come forward with that. The government should come forward to let us know, to ease our minds a bit. However, if it's the other scenarios, I just want to come forward and lie to us and tell us the entities are nice beings and they just want to warn us about nuclear. I can't handle that truth that we're insects to these beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. Thank you so much. Yes, David?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. You've asked us to speculate. I don't know. You probably don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. No, I don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. But these missiles being shut down, Captain Salas described two flights that he's aware of. I described to you one flight of 10 missiles that I'm aware of, but I'm also aware of other launch officers who've described to me similar situations. So, you know, it's not unique that him and I have been involved here. I mean, this was a situation that was occurring quite often when I served in 1966 and '67. And who knows that it's not still happening out there? There is no act of officers of any kind that will come out and admit that right now. But what I'd like to know is what's your speculation on these missiles being shut down?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. Is that rhetorical, or you need an answer?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. I'd like an answer to that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. Okay, let me come back to you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. Because I'm sure it would be just as good as my answer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. I might have something to end on, too. Let me get -- Let me offer one very -- 30-second opinion. I feel that we really do not have enough data, even now, to know exactly why this is happening. Because despite the number of cases where this does appear to have happened, there are thousands of missiles. And not all of them have been shut down, as far as we can tell. So if they're doing this, they're obviously not doing it uniformly. And I just -- I don't really feel that any researcher who has enough data to know precisely what those motivations might be. They obviously -- they seem to have demonstrated superiority over our technology. That's for sure. So at discrete moments, they seem to be able to do this. But they're not doing it uniformly. And they certainly haven't stopped all of the massive wars that have, you know, run over the planet. So there are
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. certain limits as to what they're willing to do, as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. Thank you. And I yield back my time. Madam Chair?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
