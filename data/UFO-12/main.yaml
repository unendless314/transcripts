    over the Foreign Technology Division under which is run by Colonel Paul Sleeper. Because I had left the Office of Special
    Investigations, I did not do any kind of formal report as I had been reassigned to the Pacific Air Forces at Tongyeong,
    which is in Korea. For that reason, I went out of the business.

  source_text: When I was originally in the OSI, the very first of it, there are very common appearance at a place called
    Gulf Breeze, Florida. Is that familiar to you, that location? The reason I say that is on virtually any evening you can
    go out there and you'll see them come in and land or take off. We used to report that what they were were swamp gas, very
    frankly.

    saying. I'm going to ask you just some specific questions. I want to start by saying I commend you for all the service
    you've given our country in uniform and for the things you've done that way. This is such a significant statement that
    I'm going to ask some rather specific questions if that's all right. Can you remember about when in the late '60s this
    event occurred? As close as you can. I mean, that's fine. It was just late '60s. If you know something a little more I'd
    be most interested.

    let me just turn back a little bit to Stanton Friedman and anybody that might want to answer any of these questions. What
    evidence do we have since '47, certainly in the '60s or at the time of this Alamogordo incident or anything of -- what
    is the evidence that we have that's as solid as we have? What is the most solid evidence of the humanoid parts and so
    on that somebody told Colonel French about? Can we get to a direct person that might have said something either to Colonel
    French or anybody else about Alamogordo or anything that has to do with humanoids? Let's get into that. I want to know
    the best evidence there is out there today.

  source_text: There's a book out there captured, "The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience." It's about two people who were
    abducted. They were carefully investigated by Dr. Benjamin Simon, a psychiatrist who ran a hospital for 3,000 shell shock
    war veterans. He says the emotional upheaval in their voices as he had 10 sessions with each of them was as strong as
    that in any of the war veterans that he had dealt with with PTSD. He's in the Army movie about PTSD. He knows that field,
    doesn't know flying saucers. And they saw -- they were close, intimately close to humanoids, to occupants from a vehicle
    from up there.

    and Barney Hill UFO Experience," by myself. And the woman who did most of the work was Kathleen Marden, who's Betty's
    niece. She has the hypnosis tapes. It's a long story, an involved story, but one of the best ones around in terms of the
    quality of the people. Betty was a social worker.

    weren't human. They weren't human." Since then, Brazl's own granddaughter, Fawn Fritz, has described to us that she overheard
    her grandfather also make the remark about the poor, unfortunate creatures. We've also talked to young ranch boys at that
    time, Dee Proctor and Sidney Jack Wright, who were supposedly with Brazl when he would discover a couple of bodies a few
    miles from the debris field at another location, another location, at Frankie Rowe.

    interested. I was just going to say what you seem to be asking me was, "Do we have any contemporary records from that
    time?" Somebody wrote in their diary, "I saw bodies." If you want to talk about people who saw the bodies in 1947, yeah,
    we can give you lots of names. That's all I wanted is people that said it at the time, and nobody questions they said
    it at the time. And you had said, "Well, we've got them saying it later." And I just wanted to clarify this.

  source_text: Thank you. We had mentioned Frankie Rowe. Her father was a firefighter with the Roswell Fire Department. His
    name was Dan Dwyer. And the Fire Department adjoined the courthouse at that time. There was one phone line that ran into
    both. You couldn't report an incident to one without both hearing about it. So there was the report of a crash north of
    town. There was a talk about something that had gone down north of town. And the Fire Department investigated it. They
    went to check it out. According to Frankie Rowe, who was still alive, that when her father returned, the military already
    was securing the site, but that he described that they had seen the bodies. And it was later, whether it was that evening
    or shortly thereafter, they were visited by the military, by a military officer and a number of other MPs. And they were
    very sternly warned about not talking about this.

    So Mr. Colonel Marcel, do you want to talk about what -- anything that you want to talk about that you didn't talk about
    on the first panel? Well, I just have formed a lot of opinions about UFOs and extraterrestrial visitations. And what I'd
    like to emphasize is the fact that the universe is such a large place. There's 10 to 20 second-power stars, which is about
    the number of grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. And just to say that one -- if they represent all the stars,
    there are all the grains of sand on the beach, if you only say that one has life around it like us and the rest of them
    are devoid of life, then I think

    Mogul nonsense. And the Air Force explanation that Project Mogul explains it all, that Project Mogul was highly classified,
    and that's why the officers at Roswell were unable to identify the wreckage when they saw it. But it turns out Project
    Mogul was -- although it was highly classified, the purpose, the equipment and the experiments being carried out in New
    Mexico was not classified. They were mentioned in the newspaper on July 10th as an explanation for what was found at Roswell.
    Charles Moore, who was the -- one of the scientists on Project Mogul, had said that it was so highly classified, they
    didn't even know the name. Yet, if you review Dr. Crary's diary from 1947, what you see is the name Mogul appearing periodically
    in it. The Air Forces used this as the cover. They said

    balloon. And then they gave us another one, another weather balloon as an explanation. And that seems to have set in now
    after the last 10 years with the media that, well, Roswell's explained as a weather balloon. And the answer is they can't
    even point to a flight of these balloons that have not been identified as such. So the Project Mogul explanation simply
    doesn't work. We looked at -- and I say we, Don and Stan and I have looked for alternative explanations for the Roswell
    case. We went to White Sands Missile Range to see if there was a missile launch that would account for the debris found
    on the Brazel Ranch. We went to the archives in Alamogordo on the space program to see if they were launching any kind
    of creatures, whether they were mice or mayflies or chimpanzees

  source_text: that would account for the wreckage. And we could find absolutely nothing. I had always said if we could find
    an explanation for this -- maybe they had tested an astronaut in 1947 and he was killed in the test. And if we could find
    something like that, we could write best-selling books about it and make a lot of money. But we could find nothing that
    explains the Roswell wreckage when you account for all the testimony, all the people who were involved, what they told
    us, the limited documentation we have. But when you look at all of that together, none of the explanations offered explains
    it in terrestrial terms.

    you something. It was very important. Why bother? If it's just a dumb old weather balloon, who cares? It makes no sense.
    So they went to a lot of trouble to try to cover it up.

    You know, the colonel, the head of the 509th can't identify a weather balloon? These guys had fought in the Pacific. They
    weren't right off the training base. Jesse Marcel couldn't identify a weather balloon. They got away with it. But this

  source_text: Didn't everybody believe the government back then? But in '97, that they could get away with this, it really
    bugs me. And a little inside story. I'm waiting. They have reissued, Cosimo Publishers has reissued those two volumes
    of the Roswell Report. The second one was case closed. The first one said they were not going to say anything more. Three
    years later, this is the second one. On the top, it says, "With the new introduction by nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman,
    author of Crash at Corona, the definitive study, the Roswell Incident." I'm waiting for somebody in the Air Force, because
    my comments are very strong, about lies by the Air Force, about in this report. I'm waiting for somebody to say, "Hey,
    look what he said about us. If I don't make it home, you'll know why."

    that we actually sat down and met with then Lieutenant Colonel Sheridan Cavett, he and his wife, Mary, whether in their
    home up in Sequim, Washington, or their winter home on Sierra Vista, yes. Yeah, he retired Lieutenant Colonel. And the
    very first meeting, how we spent the better part of an afternoon, his denying he was even there, that he had yet to even
    arrive at Roswell. Didn't matter. You're talking about someone else, someone who was there before me. And as we were leaving,
    he walked us out to the car and he says to us, "Boys, I need to know one thing. Should you find anything that should threaten
    national security, you will keep it to yourselves, won't you?" And we looked at one another and, "Yes, Colonel, of course,
    of course." And we got in the car and we looked

    speak with him over the phone and demonstrate not only was he there, but he was involved and to the point that, "Well,
    I went out there, but it wasn't really anything." Well, at one point he even said, "Well, it could have been a flying
    saucer, but I wasn't involved," that type of thing. The very last time we met with him and he and his wife were outside
    at the car and I said to him, "Colonel, I really have to hand it to you. You've been a man who's kept your oath all these
    years. You're a true patriot."

    in preparation of the Project Mogul Report, to which Colonel Cavett had become their lone star witness. And he snaps at

    bother telling the base commander or Major Marcel, but that he saw that it was nothing more than a weather balloon. So
    we caught him in a flat lie. He nonetheless is the only witness to this being a mogul balloon.

    that sounds like me, but I wasn't there.'" And then this was after Weaver had interviewed him. We look at the testimony
    in the report, and Kavett says, "Well, I noticed it was a weather balloon immediately.

    But they go off on another tangent. Kavett made it clear that the CIC was a Class II facility on Roswell, which means
    he did not report to Blanchard in the chain of command. Blanchard was required to support his activity. But he should
    have said something to Blanchard before he sends people out to clean the mess up and before he issues a press release
    and says, "Well, we've got a flying saucer."

    of witnesses that we have interviewed through the years. We remain in contact with the families as they continue to encourage
    us to not only pursue a final solution to what their parents so often died with or would confide, finally, to having truth
    without proof. It was one of the problems, as we depicted even in the Roswell movie, that you can swear on a stack of
    Bibles that this happened, but without the physical proof, just as none of us. We can't prove this. So what we're asking
    or what we're certainly asking as far as your counsel on behalf of those now deceased witnesses as well as their surviving
    families, what type of effort on our part or how would you advise us to even continue the work of the late Congressman
    Stephen Schiff in pushing for a disclosure

    beyond any earthly comprehension. The fact that as I keep harkening back to your own esteemed colleague, Congressman Schiff,

    we have for bringing visibility to the people of the world of this issue, you're probably not all that familiar with the
    various conferences that the UN have.

    Americans we could do it maybe through the Brazilian government or the Canadian government, they would introduce a resolution
    and the General Assembly, I'll bet you it would pass, they would fund some part of it, the rest of the funding could come
    from private sources and we would have the most awe-inspiring world event on this subject within a couple, three years.
