    to you just now exactly what you are saying. I'm going to ask you just some specific
    questions. I want to start by saying I commend you for all the service you've
    given our country in uniform and for the things you've done that way. This is
    such a significant statement that I'm going to ask some rather specific questions
    if that's all right. Can you remember about when in the late '60s this event occurred?
    As close as you can. I mean, that's fine. It was just late '60s. If you know something
    a little more I'd be most interested.

    He says the emotional upheaval in their voices as he had 10 sessions with each

    with the Roswell Fire Department. His name was Dan Dwyer. And the Fire Department
    adjoined the courthouse at that time. There was one phone line that ran into both.
    You couldn't report an incident to one without both hearing about it. So there
    was the report of a crash north of town. There was a talk about something that
    had gone down north of town. And the Fire Department investigated it. They went
    to check it out. According to Frankie Rowe, who was still alive, that when her
    father returned, the military already was securing the site, but that he described
    that they had seen the bodies. And it was later, whether it was that evening or
    shortly thereafter, they were visited by the military, by a military officer and
    a number of other MPs. And they were very sternly warned about not talking about
    this.

      Frankie Rowe 所述，當她父親返回時，軍方已經在封鎖現場，但他描述說他們看到了遺體。後來，無論是當晚還是不久之後，他們被軍方拜訪——一名軍官和一些憲兵。他們被非常嚴厲地警告不得談論此事。

    I'd like to emphasize is the fact that the universe is such a large place. There's
    10 to 20 second-power stars, which is about the number of grains of sand on all
    the beaches on Earth. And just to say that one -- if they represent all the stars,
    there are all the grains of sand on the beach, if you only say that one has life
    around it like us and the rest of them are devoid of life, then I think

    diverts us a tad bit, is this Project Mogul nonsense. And the Air Force explanation

    and that's why the officers at Roswell were unable to identify the wreckage when
    they saw it. But it turns out Project Mogul was -- although it was highly classified,
    the purpose, the equipment and the experiments being carried out in New Mexico
    was not classified. They were mentioned in the newspaper on July 10th as an explanation
    for what was found at Roswell. Charles Moore, who was the -- one of the scientists
    on Project Mogul, had said that it was so highly classified, they didn't even
    know the name. Yet, if you review Dr. Crary's diary from 1947, what you see is
    the name Mogul appearing periodically in it. The Air Forces used this as the cover.

    we lied about that, it wasn't a weather balloon. And then they gave us another
    one, another weather balloon as an explanation. And that seems to have set in
    now after the last 10 years with the media that, well, Roswell's explained as
    a weather balloon. And the answer is they can't even point to a flight of these
    balloons that have not been identified as such. So the Project Mogul explanation
    simply doesn't work. We looked at -- and I say we, Don and Stan and I have looked
    for alternative explanations for the Roswell case. We went to White Sands Missile
    Range to see if there was a missile launch that would account for the debris found
    on the Brazel Ranch. We went to the archives in Alamogordo on the space program
    to see if they were launching any kind of creatures, whether they were mice or
    mayflies or chimpanzees

    of the problems, as we depicted even in the Roswell movie, that you can swear
    on a stack of Bibles that this happened, but without the physical proof, just
    as none of us. We can't prove this. So what we're asking or what we're certainly

    far as from high altitude, should the Soviets detonate their first atomic bomb,
    we would pick up the shock wave from this acoustic listing device, this microphone,
    that when they did first detonate an atomic bomb in August of 1949, it wasn't
    mogul that picked it up.
