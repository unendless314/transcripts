      what he told Colonel Weaver. He was the one who immediately identified it as
      nothing more than this mogul balloon, and in fact, he kept it to himself. He
      didn't even bother telling the base commander or Major Marcel, but that he saw
      that it was nothing more than a weather balloon. So we caught him in a flat
      lie. He nonetheless is the only witness to this being a mogul balloon.

      Alamogordo incident or anything of -- what is the evidence that we have that's
      as solid as we have? What is the most solid evidence of the humanoid parts and

      that might have said something either to Colonel French or anybody else about
      Alamogordo or anything that has to do with humanoids? Let's get into that. I

      died with or would confide, finally, to having truth without proof. It was one
      of the problems, as we depicted even in the Roswell movie, that you can swear
      on a stack of Bibles that this happened, but without the physical proof, just

      I just have formed a lot of opinions about UFOs and extraterrestrial visitations.

      place. There's 10 to 20 second-power stars, which is about the number of grains

      war veterans. He says the emotional upheaval in their voices as he had 10 sessions
      with each of them was as strong as that in any of the war veterans that he had
      dealt with with PTSD. He's in the Army movie about PTSD. He knows that field,

      with the Roswell Fire Department. His name was Dan Dwyer. And the Fire Department
      adjoined the courthouse at that time. There was one phone line that ran into
      both. You couldn't report an incident to one without both hearing about it.
      So there was the report of a crash north of town. There was a talk about something
      that had gone down north of town. And the Fire Department investigated it. They
      went to check it out. According to Frankie Rowe, who was still alive, that when
      her father returned, the military already was securing the site, but that he
      described that they had seen the bodies. And it was later, whether it was that
      evening or shortly thereafter, they were visited by the military, by a military
      officer and a number of other MPs. And they were very sternly warned about not
      talking about this.

    source_text: originally in 1947 it was a weather balloon. Then they said, well,
      we lied about that, it wasn't a weather balloon. And then they gave us another
      one, another weather balloon as an explanation. And that seems to have set in
      now after the last 10 years with the media that, well, Roswell's explained as
      a weather balloon. And the answer is they can't even point to a flight of these
      balloons that have not been identified as such. So the Project Mogul explanation
      simply doesn't work. We looked at -- and I say we, Don and Stan and I have looked
      for alternative explanations for the Roswell case. We went to White Sands Missile
      Range to see if there was a missile launch that would account for the debris
      found on the Brazel Ranch. We went to the archives in Alamogordo on the space
      program to see if they were launching any kind of creatures, whether they were
      mice or mayflies or chimpanzees

    source_text: that would account for the wreckage. And we could find absolutely
      nothing. I had always said if we could find an explanation for this -- maybe
      they had tested an astronaut in 1947 and he was killed in the test. And if we
      could find something like that, we could write best-selling books about it and
      make a lot of money. But we could find nothing that explains the Roswell wreckage
      when you account for all the testimony, all the people who were involved, what
      they told us, the limited documentation we have. But when you look at all of
      that together, none of the explanations offered explains it in terrestrial terms.

      what he told Colonel Weaver. He was the one who immediately identified it as
      nothing more than this mogul balloon, and in fact, he kept it to himself. He
      didn't even bother telling the base commander or Major Marcel, but that he saw
      that it was nothing more than a weather balloon. So we caught him in a flat
      lie. He nonetheless is the only witness to this being a mogul balloon.

      when they saw it. But it turns out Project Mogul was -- although it was highly
      classified, the purpose, the equipment and the experiments being carried out
      in New Mexico was not classified. They were mentioned in the newspaper on July
      10th as an explanation for what was found at Roswell. Charles Moore, who was
      the -- one of the scientists on Project Mogul, had said that it was so highly
      classified, they didn't even know the name. Yet, if you review Dr. Crary's diary
      from 1947, what you see is the name Mogul appearing periodically in it. The
      Air Forces used this as the cover. They said

      now after the last 10 years with the media that, well, Roswell's explained as
      a weather balloon. And the answer is they can't even point to a flight of these
      balloons that have not been identified as such. So the Project Mogul explanation
      simply doesn't work. We looked at -- and I say we, Don and Stan and I have looked

      classified, the purpose, the equipment and the experiments being carried out
      in New Mexico was not classified. They were mentioned in the newspaper on July
      10th as an explanation for what was found at Roswell. Charles Moore, who was
      the -- one of the scientists on Project Mogul, had said that it was so highly
      classified, they didn't even know the name. Yet, if you review Dr. Crary's diary
