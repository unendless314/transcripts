## Speaker Group 1

123. Well, our next person to question is Carolyn Kirkpatrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. Thank you, old chairman. Mr. Schmidt. Could you give me four sound scientific reasons why we ought to look further into Roswell or why Roswell is important to what we're discussing this week?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. Very good. As I remarked in my opening statement, we're here representing the memories of so many of the hundreds of witnesses that we have interviewed through the years. We remain in contact with the families as they continue to encourage us to not only pursue a final solution to what their parents so often died with or would confide, finally, to having truth without proof. It was one of the problems, as we depicted even in the Roswell movie, that you can swear on a stack of Bibles that this happened, but without the physical proof, just as none of us. We can't prove this. So what we're asking or what we're certainly asking as far as your counsel on behalf of those now deceased witnesses as well as their surviving families, what type of effort on our part or how would you advise us to even continue the work of the late Congressman Stephen Schiff in pushing for a disclosure
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. of the file, an opening of the Roswell file once and for all. We don't want to see Project Mogul. We know all about Project Mogul, and it does not address the eyewitness testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. The wooden crash dummies wasn't even that same year. It was five years removed. We're talking about sworn affidavits, deathbed declarations, and the support of the families who would at least like to know that their spouses, their husbands, their fathers didn't live a lie, didn't persist in maintaining that this was something extraordinary, this was something beyond any earthly comprehension. The fact that as I keep harkening back to your own esteemed colleague, Congressman Schiff, he obviously saw that he was being stonewalled, that there was much more to this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. Please stop. Give me three or four specific scientific realities that we know happened at Roswell, in Roswell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. It's an historic fact that the United States Army Air Corps announced on July 8th that they had captured a flying saucer. That's not scientific, it's historic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. And they acknowledged that Mr. Marcellus' father saw particles.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. Some people saw a crash.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. And did you just say the military or our government acknowledged that a flying saucer or something crashed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. They put out a press release.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. Okay, that's a good one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. That they actually captured a flying disk, correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. Okay, that's one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. Two would be the fact that for years thereafter, no matter what, the second solution to the recovery, the weather balloon, eyewitnesses were still discussing this with their families, still saying that the flying saucer was the correct explanation, even to their deathbeds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. The third would be the deathbed testimonies admissible in a court of law.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. And what did one or two of them allude to or testify to or say?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. As I stated earlier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. That they saw it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. They saw it crash?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. They would talk about either guarding, shipping, crating up, flying out, the remains, the wreckage, handling of the wreckage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. Seeing the bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. All that needs to be on the record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. That's why I want you to be specific and you're doing well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. One more, sir?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. Any one other thing, if there is one, if there's none, that's okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. Fourth would certainly be flight records, for example.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. Records as far as outgoing cryptology records from the base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. This was one of the things that even Congressman Schiff was pushing for through the general accounting office for all the records concerning the events.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. And the GAO, their information received from all branches of the military, specifically the Air Force, was that all the records of the base of Roswell in the summer of 1947 had been mysteriously destroyed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. Now, we don't believe that for a second.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. No, they're classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. They're over there somewhere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. That's right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. I don't want to lose what we have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. Our responsibility is here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. So those records exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. And we would also ask that, again, if they were to disclose anything else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. Anything else of this panel, and others probably too, and you just identified three or four things just off the top.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. There might be ten.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. That would give us something in writing, a page or two, with listing those so that we wouldn't have to dig them up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. It would help us in our deliberations or whatever recommendation we would make.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. If the experts can provide, particularly this on Roswell and some of the other things that we heard in the last three days, and I'm sure the next two, that would help us make intelligent decisions on what we might get together and try to agree on and try to recommend, if we can come to such a point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. That would be helpful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. Let me just...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. I should...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. Well, just, we did mention that during the break.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. That we should have provided you with a timeline, a breakdown, a principle.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. But...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. It's not too late, though.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. It's not too late.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. The fact that if we combine as far as Stan's efforts and our own, we're talking a combination of we're approaching 100 years of research in this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. I understand, I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. And it has become so complicated, so involved, that to just provide even a briefing paper, we would be happy to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. And what I'm suggesting is that you all have the briefing paper and we'll brief who we want to share this information with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. We don't have to have it quite finite like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. We do have to have it in a statement of two or three sentences that we would understand that we can teach and mobilize and educate others so that we know what we're talking about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. I mean, you guys need to actually give it to them and give them the detailed information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. That's not to mention that you probably shouldn't have some.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. If it's this important, and I think that it is in terms of what we're here for this week, there ought to be something, a document, a something, that all of you all can come behind in all the research that you've done.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. You know something, you know how you're in college and get these primers?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. It doesn't have to be a big volume.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. You've got them in a lot of volumes already just pulling it together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. Because of all the work that members of the House and Senate do in this town, it's going to be something like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. It's not going to be a big volume that gets the attention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. It's what you say, how you say it, and how concise you can do it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. If you'll do that, that'll help us do whatever we're going to finally end up doing and presenting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. I forgot that the panel wasn't at my lecture last night where I went into service.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. Too late.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. We started six in the morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. We don't do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. You're right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. I mean, we really do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. And we go from six in the morning, contrary to what the newspaper says about all of us, we work very hard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. From six in the morning to ten or eleven at night.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. But it's all nonstop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. But we're very sorry that we couldn't get in.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. We probably won't be the ones this evening.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. But that's not to say that we aren't interested in what you do and what you say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. And we have prepared briefing documents in the past when we have responded to the Air Force, for example, regarding Project Mogul.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. And we would have press conferences and we would have briefing documents to present as far as to the media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. We'll go back, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. Congressman?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. Congresswoman?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. Lynn?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. You, he knows my name, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
