## Speaker Group 1

123. Well, our next person to question is Carolyn Kirkpatrick.
→ {"text": "好的，我們的下一位提問者是 Carolyn Kirkpatrick。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. Thank you, old chairman. Mr. Schmidt. Could you give me four sound scientific reasons why we ought to look further into Roswell or why Roswell is important to what we're discussing this week?
→ {"text": "謝謝您，主席先生。Schmidt 先生，您能給我四個充分的科學理由，說明我們為何應該進一步調查羅斯威爾事件，或者說羅斯威爾事件對於我們本週討論的議題為何重要？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "評審小組成員要求提供科學證據"}

125. Very good. As I remarked in my opening statement, we're here representing the memories of so many of the hundreds of witnesses that we have interviewed through the years. We remain in contact with the families as they continue to encourage us to not only pursue a final solution to what their parents so often died with or would confide, finally, to having truth without proof. It was one of the problems, as we depicted even in the Roswell movie, that you can swear on a stack of Bibles that this happened, but without the physical proof, just as none of us. We can't prove this. So what we're asking or what we're certainly asking as far as your counsel on behalf of those now deceased witnesses as well as their surviving families, what type of effort on our part or how would you advise us to even continue the work of the late Congressman Stephen Schiff in pushing for a disclosure
→ {"text": "非常好。正如我在開場陳述中所說，我們在此代表的是這些年來我們訪談過的數百位證人的記憶。我們與他們的家屬持續保持聯繫，他們不斷鼓勵我們，不僅要為他們的父母追求最終的真相解答——那些他們往往帶著遺憾離世、或最終僅能吐露「有真相卻無證據」的事實。這是一個難題，就像我們在羅斯威爾電影中所描述的，您可以對著聖經發誓這件事發生過，但若沒有實體證據，就像我們所有人一樣，我們無法證明這一點。因此，我們想請教的是——代表那些已故證人及其倖存家屬——我們應該採取什麼樣的努力，或者您會如何建議我們繼續已故的 Stephen Schiff 眾議員的工作，推動真相揭露", "confidence": "high", "notes": "長句，保持正式語氣，Congressman Stephen Schiff 根據 terminology.yaml 譯為「史蒂文·希夫眾議員」但此處使用全名形式"}

126. of the file, an opening of the Roswell file once and for all. We don't want to see Project Mogul. We know all about Project Mogul, and it does not address the eyewitness testimony.
→ {"text": "徹底公開羅斯威爾檔案。我們不想再看到莫古爾計畫的說法。我們對莫古爾計畫瞭若指掌，而它根本無法解釋目擊證人的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Project Mogul 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「莫古爾計畫」"}

127. The wooden crash dummies wasn't even that same year. It was five years removed. We're talking about sworn affidavits, deathbed declarations, and the support of the families who would at least like to know that their spouses, their husbands, their fathers didn't live a lie, didn't persist in maintaining that this was something extraordinary, this was something beyond any earthly comprehension. The fact that as I keep harkening back to your own esteemed colleague, Congressman Schiff, he obviously saw that he was being stonewalled, that there was much more to this.
→ {"text": "那些木製墜落假人甚至不是同一年的事，那是五年之後的事。我們談論的是宣誓證詞、臨終證詞，以及那些家屬的支持——他們至少希望知道，他們的配偶、丈夫、父親並沒有活在謊言中，並非執意堅稱這是某種非凡的事物、某種超越人類理解的事物。正如我不斷提及您尊敬的同僚 Schiff 眾議員，他顯然看出他遭到阻撓，這背後有更多隱情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "deathbed declarations 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「臨終證詞」；Congressman Schiff 簡稱形式"}

128. Please stop. Give me three or four specific scientific realities that we know happened at Roswell, in Roswell.
→ {"text": "請停一下。給我三或四個具體的科學事實，我們確知在羅斯威爾發生的事實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. It's an historic fact that the United States Army Air Corps announced on July 8th that they had captured a flying saucer. That's not scientific, it's historic.
→ {"text": "這是歷史事實，美國陸軍航空隊在7月8日宣布他們捕獲了一架飛碟。這不是科學事實，而是歷史事實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "United States Army Air Corps 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「美國陸軍航空隊」；flying saucer 譯為「飛碟」"}

130. And they acknowledged that Mr. Marcellus' father saw particles.
→ {"text": "而且他們承認 Marcellus 先生的父親看到了碎片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指 Major Marcel"}

131. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. Some people saw a crash.
→ {"text": "有些人看到了墜毀現場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. And did you just say the military or our government acknowledged that a flying saucer or something crashed?
→ {"text": "您剛才是說軍方或我們的政府承認有飛碟或某種東西墜毀了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. They put out a press release.
→ {"text": "他們發布了新聞稿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. Okay, that's a good one.
→ {"text": "好的，這是一個很好的理由。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. That they actually captured a flying disk, correct.
→ {"text": "他們確實宣稱捕獲了一架飛碟，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "flying disk 與 flying saucer 同義"}

138. Okay, that's one.
→ {"text": "好的，這是第一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. Two would be the fact that for years thereafter, no matter what, the second solution to the recovery, the weather balloon, eyewitnesses were still discussing this with their families, still saying that the flying saucer was the correct explanation, even to their deathbeds.
→ {"text": "第二點是，在那之後的許多年裡，無論如何，儘管官方對回收物的第二種解釋是氣象氣球，目擊證人仍在與家人討論此事，仍然堅稱飛碟才是正確的解釋，即使到臨終之際也是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "weather balloon 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「氣象氣球」"}

140. The third would be the deathbed testimonies admissible in a court of law.
→ {"text": "第三點是在法庭上可採信的臨終證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "deathbed testimonies/declarations 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「臨終證詞」"}

141. And what did one or two of them allude to or testify to or say?
→ {"text": "他們其中一兩位提到、作證或說了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. As I stated earlier.
→ {"text": "如我先前所述。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. That they saw it?
→ {"text": "他們看到了它？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. They saw it crash?
→ {"text": "他們看到它墜毀？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. They would talk about either guarding, shipping, crating up, flying out, the remains, the wreckage, handling of the wreckage.
→ {"text": "他們會談到守衛現場、運送、裝箱、空運遺體、殘骸，以及處理殘骸的過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. Seeing the bodies.
→ {"text": "看到遺體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. All that needs to be on the record.
→ {"text": "所有這些都需要被記錄在案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. That's why I want you to be specific and you're doing well.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼我要求您具體說明，而您做得很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. One more, sir?
→ {"text": "還有一個嗎，先生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. Any one other thing, if there is one, if there's none, that's okay.
→ {"text": "還有任何其他事項嗎？如果有的話，如果沒有也沒關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. Fourth would certainly be flight records, for example.
→ {"text": "第四點當然是飛行記錄，例如。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. Records as far as outgoing cryptology records from the base.
→ {"text": "基地外發的密碼通訊記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "cryptology records 指密碼通訊記錄"}

154. This was one of the things that even Congressman Schiff was pushing for through the general accounting office for all the records concerning the events.
→ {"text": "這正是 Schiff 眾議員透過總審計辦公室要求調閱有關事件所有記錄時所推動的事項之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "general accounting office 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「總審計辦公室」"}

155. And the GAO, their information received from all branches of the military, specifically the Air Force, was that all the records of the base of Roswell in the summer of 1947 had been mysteriously destroyed.
→ {"text": "而總審計辦公室從各軍種——特別是空軍——所獲得的資訊是，羅斯威爾基地1947年夏季的所有記錄都已神秘地被銷毀了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "GAO 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「總審計辦公室」"}

156. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. Now, we don't believe that for a second.
→ {"text": "我們一點都不相信這個說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. No, they're classified.
→ {"text": "不，它們被列為機密了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Classified 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「機密」"}

159. They're over there somewhere.
→ {"text": "它們就在那裡的某個地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. That's right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. I don't want to lose what we have.
→ {"text": "我不想失去我們現有的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. Our responsibility is here.
→ {"text": "我們的責任在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. So those records exist.
→ {"text": "所以那些記錄是存在的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. And we would also ask that, again, if they were to disclose anything else.
→ {"text": "而且我們也會要求，如果他們要揭露任何其他資訊的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. Anything else of this panel, and others probably too, and you just identified three or four things just off the top.
→ {"text": "本評審小組——可能還有其他人——還有任何其他要求，而您剛才已經隨口列出了三或四項。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. There might be ten.
→ {"text": "可能有十項。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. That would give us something in writing, a page or two, with listing those so that we wouldn't have to dig them up.
→ {"text": "如果能給我們一份書面資料，一兩頁，列出這些項目，這樣我們就不用自己去挖掘了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. It would help us in our deliberations or whatever recommendation we would make.
→ {"text": "這將有助於我們的審議，或我們將提出的任何建議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. If the experts can provide, particularly this on Roswell and some of the other things that we heard in the last three days, and I'm sure the next two, that would help us make intelligent decisions on what we might get together and try to agree on and try to recommend, if we can come to such a point.
→ {"text": "如果專家們能夠提供——特別是關於羅斯威爾事件以及我們在過去三天聽到的其他事項，我相信接下來兩天也會有——這將幫助我們做出明智的決定，決定我們可能如何匯集意見、嘗試達成共識，並嘗試提出建議，如果我們能夠達到那一步的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "長句，保持正式語氣"}

171. That would be helpful.
→ {"text": "那會很有幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. Let me just...

173. I should...
→ {"text": "我應該…", "confidence": "high", "notes": "未完成的句子"}

→ {"text": "不過，還不算太晚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

178. It's not too late.
→ {"text": "還不算太晚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. The fact that if we combine as far as Stan's efforts and our own, we're talking a combination of we're approaching 100 years of research in this.

180. I understand, I understand.
→ {"text": "我理解，我理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

181. And it has become so complicated, so involved, that to just provide even a briefing paper, we would be happy to do that.
→ {"text": "而且這已經變得如此複雜、如此繁瑣，光是提供一份簡報文件，我們都會很樂意這麼做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "briefing paper 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「簡報文件」"}

182. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. And what I'm suggesting is that you all have the briefing paper and we'll brief who we want to share this information with.
→ {"text": "我的建議是，你們所有人都準備好簡報文件，然後我們會向我們想要分享這些資訊的人進行簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. We don't have to have it quite finite like that.
→ {"text": "我們不需要把它做得那麼明確具體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. We do have to have it in a statement of two or three sentences that we would understand that we can teach and mobilize and educate others so that we know what we're talking about.
→ {"text": "我們確實需要用兩三句話的陳述來表達，我們能理解、能教導、能動員並教育他人，這樣我們才知道自己在談論什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. I mean, you guys need to actually give it to them and give them the detailed information.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，你們需要實際把文件交給他們，並提供詳細資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. That's not to mention that you probably shouldn't have some.
→ {"text": "更不用說你們可能應該準備一些。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句意略有模糊"}

188. If it's this important, and I think that it is in terms of what we're here for this week, there ought to be something, a document, a something, that all of you all can come behind in all the research that you've done.
→ {"text": "如果這件事如此重要——而我認為就我們本週在此的目的而言確實如此——那麼應該要有某些東西、某份文件、某種成果，能夠代表你們所有人在所有研究中的成果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. It's not going to be a big volume that gets the attention.
→ {"text": "不會是一本厚重的書籍能引起注意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. It's what you say, how you say it, and how concise you can do it.
→ {"text": "重要的是你說什麼、怎麼說，以及能做到多簡潔。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. If you'll do that, that'll help us do whatever we're going to finally end up doing and presenting.
