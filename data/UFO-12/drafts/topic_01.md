5. That I will tell the truth.

7. And nothing but the truth.

8. To this committee today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. Thank you, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. Mr. Chair, I believe we're ready to begin.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. We're reconvening the hearing and we have a new witness and we're going to start questioning from going this direction, taking testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. Since we've heard testimony from the other individuals, I think we might open it up between a Q&A between the members and yourselves because I think it generates focused information for the hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. And not necessarily because we're so bright but it's because the combination, the synergy of the two can be very effective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. Colonel French, did we have testimony from you the other day or is this the first time you have appeared?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. No, this is my second appearance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. That's what I thought.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. I thought I remembered you and I was impressed the last time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. Colonel French, the floor is yours and give us testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. I am Lieutenant Colonel Richard French, United States Air Force retired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. I'm also a PhD.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. I was assigned to the 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron in Alexandria, Louisiana at England Air Force Base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. I was sent to Alamogordo, New Mexico to accomplish my annual refresher course in the altitude chamber.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. While there I learned of an accident a few miles away from Alamogordo in the direction of the White Sands, a short time later I witnessed the takeoff of a prototype of a fighter aircraft that I either recognized or knew, had no idea what it was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. Anyway the aircraft took off at a very high rate of speed and fired a rocket.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. The rocket was basically five inches in diameter and about six feet long, about the same size as some of the modern anti-aircraft aerial rockets, I mean air-to-air aerial rockets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. Afterward I was asked to review some of the items that were picked up from the crash site.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. There was no unknown, there was an unknown number of humanoids either killed or injured.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. The parts of the casualties were taken to base operations at Holloman Air Force Base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. The only parts of the craft that I was allowed to see had markings that appeared to be Arabic or some language I didn't understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. Later I learned the parts and the casualties were transported to Wright Patterson Air Force Base and turned over the Foreign Technology Division under which is run by Colonel Paul Sleeper. Because I had left the Office of Special Investigations, I did not do any kind of formal report as I had been reassigned to the Pacific Air Forces at Tongyeong, which is in Korea. For that reason, I went out of the business.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. I have quite an experience of seeing UFOs. The reason for that, very simply, is this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. When I was originally in the OSI, the very first of it, there are very common appearance at a place called Gulf Breeze, Florida. Is that familiar to you, that location? The reason I say that is on virtually any evening you can go out there and you'll see them come in and land or take off. We used to report that what they were were swamp gas, very frankly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. It was one of those things. Of course it was a lie, but I was required to lie. That concludes my statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
