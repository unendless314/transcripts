## Speaker Group 1

218. Somewhere in today's testimonies in the papers, was it Major Marcel that was put into, taken, put in a house where he was held kind of hostage?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. Oh, that was Brazel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. Talk about that a little bit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. What was that about and how did he get through that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. What happened is Brazel came in the course on a Sunday and announced that he had this debris.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. He then led Marcel and Cavett back out to the ranch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. They brought the material back to Roswell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. He stayed at the ranch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. Now a couple of days later, the radio station owner of KGFL brought Brazel back into town so that they could interview him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. They recorded an hour-long interview with him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. Before they could air that, they got, and we have this testimony on both audio and video tape from Jud Roberts, who was a minority station owner of KGFL, that they were told by their congressional representatives that if they aired that report, they better start looking for another job because they wouldn't be in the radio business anymore.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. Walt Whitmore, who was the majority owner, took Brazel out to the base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. That's how he got out to the base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. They then kept him out there for a number of days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. They brought him into, or took him into Roswell to the newspaper.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. He made the statement that appeared on July 9th about the harassed rancher who found the whole thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. According to what Brazel said to neighbors, Marion Strickland, the proctors, and people like this, he was held there for a number of days and was not allowed to leave so that the military had him in custody.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. Edwin Easley, who was the provost marshal, was the one who told me that he was held in the guest house as opposed to another facility on the base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. He was held there for a number of days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. His son, Bill Brazel, read about his father in the newspaper, went to the ranch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. His father wasn't there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. He came back a number of days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. The best estimate is he was held in Roswell for four to six days after he had returned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. Is that when he stopped talking?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. He was told ... I always got the impression from talking to Bill Brazel that they merely said to him, "We would rather you kept this quiet."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. Bill said to us, and my father was such a man, that if you asked him to do something like that and he gave his word, then that was good enough and he wasn't going to talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. He shared very little with his family about what had happened to him or the neighbors, but he was really annoyed about being held in Roswell for a number of days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. That is what he talked about to the neighbors, and we have a great deal of testimony from those who heard him talking about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. You're talking about a civilian who is essentially arrested, detained by the military for five to six days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. He was not afforded due process, your typical two phone calls.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. He was not even allowed to call his own wife to tell her where he was and that he was okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. He described how he was kept up all hours of the night and he was asked the same questions over and over again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. It still comes back to what information, what did he see that was so sensitive that the military sought in their best interest to keep him under lock and key until they gained his cooperation and then were assured in their releasing him that he would not say anything further about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. As his son Bill would say to us, "It's better you don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. Don't ask.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

253. It's better you don't know."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. I really don't have anything else, so thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. Thank you very much, Congressman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. Again, thank you all very much for your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
