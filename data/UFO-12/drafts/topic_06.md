241. Is that when he stopped talking?

→ {"text": "他被告知……我與比爾·布拉澤爾交談時總是得到這樣的印象，他們只是對他說：『我們希望你對這件事保持安靜。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. He was not afforded due process, your typical two phone calls.

248. He was not even allowed to call his own wife to tell her where he was and that he was okay.
→ {"text": "他甚至不被允許打電話給自己的妻子，告訴她他在哪裡以及他安然無恙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. He described how he was kept up all hours of the night and he was asked the same questions over and over again.
→ {"text": "他描述他如何在深夜被保持清醒，並且被一遍又一遍地問同樣的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. It still comes back to what information, what did he see that was so sensitive that the military sought in their best interest to keep him under lock and key until they gained his cooperation and then were assured in their releasing him that he would not say anything further about this.
→ {"text": "這仍然回到一個問題：什麼資訊、他看到了什麼如此敏感的東西，以至於軍方認為最符合他們利益的做法是把他鎖起來，直到他們獲得他的配合，然後在釋放他時確信他不會再說任何關於此事的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. As his son Bill would say to us, "It's better you don't know.
