## Speaker Group 1

258. These were not animal remains in that rocket.
→ {"text": "那枚火箭裡並非動物遺骸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. I can say that with some confidence because I was involved in the first suborbital primate flight in Pensacola, Florida and I went there in 1959.
→ {"text": "我可以很有信心地說這點，因為我參與了佛羅里達州彭薩科拉的首次次軌道靈長類飛行，我於1959年前往該處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. It was about 1960 that we did the first suborbital primate flight early, early in our space venture.
→ {"text": "我們在1960年左右進行了首次次軌道靈長類飛行，那是我們太空探索非常早期的階段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. Was there a mogul launch that could have been responsible for this?
→ {"text": "是否有莫古爾計畫的發射可能造成這起事件？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. The evidence that has been presented, it was Dr. Albert Crary's diary who gave us the information.
→ {"text": "已經提出的證據是艾伯特·克雷里博士的日記，該日記提供了我們資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. The identified flight was supposedly flight number four on June 4th, 1947.
→ {"text": "被指認的飛行據稱是1947年6月4日的四號飛行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. According to Crary's diary, because of cloud cover, the missile launch had been canceled, so their flight was canceled.
→ {"text": "根據克雷里的日記，由於雲層覆蓋，飛彈發射被取消，因此他們的飛行也被取消了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. Charles Moore, who was a scientist, told me when that happened, they stripped the equipment from the balloons, from the arrays, but they couldn't let the helium out of the balloons, so they would let the balloons go.
→ {"text": "科學家查爾斯·摩爾告訴我，當這種情況發生時，他們會從氣球和陣列中拆除設備，但他們無法將氣球中的氦氣釋放出來，所以他們會讓氣球飛走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. Crary's diary then has a cryptic note about on the same day that we flew sonobuoy up there and couldn't get good reception, so there's some discussion about it.
→ {"text": "克雷里的日記隨後有一條神祕的註記，關於同一天我們將聲納浮標飛到那裡，但無法獲得良好的接收，因此對此有些討論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. The first recorded flight for Project Mogul was flight number five.
→ {"text": "莫古爾計畫的首次記錄飛行是五號飛行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. There had been three flights in New Jersey prior to them getting to New Mexico.
→ {"text": "在他們抵達新墨西哥州之前，已經在紐澤西州進行過三次飛行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. The documentation is a little bit hinky on that, but according to what Charles Moore had said in a letter that he wrote in 1995, that they didn't file the NOTAM as they were required by the CAA at the time.
→ {"text": "關於這點的文件紀錄有點可疑，但根據查爾斯·摩爾在1995年寫的一封信中所說，他們並未依照當時民航管理局的要求提交飛行通告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "NOTAM = Notice to Airmen 飛行通告；CAA = Civil Aeronautics Administration 民航管理局"}

270. I'm sure he did this because we went through the archives.
→ {"text": "我確信他這麼做是因為我們查閱了檔案。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語境略微模糊"}

271. I went to the archives looking for the notums because I'd like to see how they described the arrays and if there was a notum for the June 4th launch.
→ {"text": "我前往檔案館尋找飛行通告，因為我想看看他們如何描述這些陣列，以及6月4日的發射是否有飛行通告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. He said in a 1995 letter that they had not contacted the FAA because they didn't expect this mythical flight to get off the restricted area at White Sand.
→ {"text": "他在1995年的信中表示，他們並未聯繫聯邦航空管理局，因為他們預期這次虛構的飛行不會離開白沙的限制區域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. Even if the flight was launched, it wasn't expected to reach any altitudes and it wasn't suspected to get off the White Sand's missile range, according to him.
→ {"text": "根據他的說法，即使這次飛行被發射，也不預期達到任何高度，也不預期會離開白沙飛彈試驗場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. I'm sure that he'd said that simply because that would explain why there was no FAA notification.
→ {"text": "我確信他這麼說純粹是因為這樣可以解釋為何沒有聯邦航空管理局的通知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. There was no good documentation that flight number four ever was launched.
→ {"text": "沒有可靠的文件紀錄證明四號飛行曾經發射過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. There was no good documentation that it reached the Brazel Ranch.
→ {"text": "沒有可靠的文件紀錄證明它抵達了布拉澤爾牧場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. There was no good documentation that Brazel was unable to identify the weather balloons.
→ {"text": "沒有可靠的文件紀錄證明布拉澤爾無法辨識氣象氣球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. The Mogul arrays were just weather balloons.
→ {"text": "莫古爾陣列只不過是氣象氣球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. There were weather balloons.
→ {"text": "它們是氣象氣球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. There was 15, 20 weather balloons strung together, but it's still weather balloons.
→ {"text": "有15到20個氣象氣球串在一起，但它們依然是氣象氣球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. Jesse Marcel would have recognized the weather balloons for what they were.
→ {"text": "傑西·馬瑟爾會辨認出氣象氣球的真面目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Jesse Marcel 保留原文"}

282. Cavett obviously recognized the weather balloons, but the point is simply that had it been a Project Mogul flight, we would have been able to identify it specifically from the testimonies of the witnesses and the documentation available.
→ {"text": "卡維特顯然辨認出了氣象氣球，但重點在於，如果那是莫古爾計畫的飛行，我們應該能夠從證人的證詞和現有文件中明確辨識出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. Why would they need a several day cleanup if it was a Mogul balloon?
→ {"text": "如果那是莫古爾氣球，為什麼需要花好幾天清理？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. They wouldn't have if it had been a Mogul.
→ {"text": "如果那是莫古爾，他們就不會這麼做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. Was there in fact, is that well documented there was a several day cleanup with a number of military people?
→ {"text": "事實上是否有充分的文件紀錄證明有大量軍事人員進行了為期數天的清理工作？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. According to the witnesses, the people who were on the debris field cleaning it up, the men who were there that we were able to interview prior to their deaths, some of them on audio tape, some of them on video tape, they spent several days cleaning up the debris on the Brazel Ranch site.
→ {"text": "根據證人的說法，在殘骸場進行清理的人員，那些我們能夠在他們過世前訪問的人，有些錄在錄音帶上，有些錄在錄影帶上，他們花了好幾天清理布拉澤爾牧場現場的殘骸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. Before my dad died, I asked him, "Would any of the debris still be out there?"
→ {"text": "在我父親過世前，我問他：「還有任何殘骸留在那裡嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. And he says, "No, they vacuum the place up."
→ {"text": "他說：「沒有，他們把那個地方抽乾淨了。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. That was his words.
→ {"text": "這是他的原話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. They vacuumed it up.
→ {"text": "他們把它抽乾淨了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. Really thorough cleanup.
→ {"text": "真是非常徹底的清理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. Why do we assume that other intelligent life has to look something like us?
→ {"text": "為什麼我們假設其他智慧生命必須看起來像我們？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. We don't.
→ {"text": "我們沒有這樣假設。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. Isn't that a little arrogant?
→ {"text": "那不是有點傲慢嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. We don't.
→ {"text": "我們沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. We don't?
→ {"text": "我們沒有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. You're talking about humanoids.
→ {"text": "你們在談論類人生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. You go with the flow.
→ {"text": "你順著證據走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. You're talking about humanoids.
→ {"text": "你們在談論類人生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. That's what people say.
→ {"text": "這是人們所說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. Oh.
→ {"text": "哦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. You go with the flow.
→ {"text": "你順著證據走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. But they would have said, "They're two arms, two legs ahead in the body."
→ {"text": "但他們會說：「他們是兩隻手臂、兩條腿，加上頭部和身體。」", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文文法略有問題，依語境理解翻譯"}

309. The guys with three arms and three legs go to Jupiter, you know, for their vacation.
→ {"text": "你知道的，那些有三隻手臂和三條腿的傢伙去木星度假。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "幽默語氣"}

310. On the other hand, it may be that we are somebody's colony that they seated us here, a penal colony that they call dead boys and girls here.
→ {"text": "另一方面，也許我們是某人的殖民地，他們把我們安置在這裡，一個他們稱為放逐壞孩子的流放地。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "推測性語氣"}

311. I'm sure there are some debunkers who have suggested that if we're seeing humanoids, we're hallucinating because it's perfectly conceivable that other intelligent life could have a different form than we have.
→ {"text": "我確信有些懷疑論者曾提出，如果我們看到類人生物，我們是在產生幻覺，因為其他智慧生命完全有可能具有與我們不同的形態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. But not necessarily.
→ {"text": "但不一定如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. As Dr. Michael D. Swords, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan Kalamazoo, professor of natural history, biologists, has suggested, if we consider biological symmetry, that throughout the universe that there would be a common link, that there would potentially be a resemblance, that they would be humanoid.
→ {"text": "正如密西根大學卡拉馬祖分校榮譽退休教授、自然史與生物學教授麥可·索茲博士所提出的，如果我們考慮生物對稱性，那麼整個宇宙中可能存在共同的聯繫，可能存在相似性，他們可能是類人生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Dr. Michael D. Swords 保留原文"}

314. That's conceivable.
→ {"text": "這是可以想像的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. That's conceivable.
→ {"text": "這是可以想像的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. That's what the evidence shows.
→ {"text": "這就是證據所顯示的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. It doesn't mean that there's nobody else out there.
→ {"text": "這並不意味著外面沒有其他生命。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. Non-humanoid.
→ {"text": "非類人生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

319. It doesn't mean that.
→ {"text": "這不意味著那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. In fact, if you take a look at all of the history of UFO sightings when they've reported occupants or creatures from inside, historically most of them have been humanoid.
→ {"text": "事實上，如果你審視所有不明飛行物目擊的歷史記錄，當他們報告內部的乘員或生物時，歷史上大部分都是類人生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. There are some cases where one of them was described as a hairy jelly bean bag.
→ {"text": "有些案例中，其中一個被描述為毛茸茸的軟糖豆袋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "幽默描述"}

322. Things like that.
→ {"text": "諸如此類的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. But the testimony from the people who've seen creatures from inside the craft normally report a humanoid.
→ {"text": "但那些看過飛行器內部生物的人的證詞通常報告的是類人生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. Maybe taller than us.
→ {"text": "也許比我們高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. Maybe shorter than us.
→ {"text": "也許比我們矮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. Maybe much more robust.

327. But it's usually a humanoid creature.
→ {"text": "但通常是類人生物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. There are some cases where they're robotic in nature.
→ {"text": "有些案例中，它們本質上是機械性的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. And in Pascagoula, the fellows there described something that really wasn't much in the way of a humanoid but resembled vaguely a human.
→ {"text": "而在帕斯卡古拉，那裡的人描述的東西實際上並不太像類人生物，但模糊地類似人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. I knew Steve Schiff, by the way.

340. The fact that they sent these people these findings to Wright-Patterson.
→ {"text": "他們將這些人和這些發現送往萊特-帕特森的事實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. And the third thing is they were cleaning it up.
→ {"text": "第三件事是他們在進行清理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. If it was a weather balloon, none of those things would have been -- none of those things would have happened.
→ {"text": "如果那是氣象氣球，這些事情都不會——這些事情都不會發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. Well, the first one, there might have been some confusion, wild confusion, the first one.
→ {"text": "嗯，第一件事，可能會有些混亂，極度混亂，第一件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. But the second two, never.

346. And they never would have cleaned up anything if it had been a weather balloon.

347. What challenge?
→ {"text": "什麼挑戰？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. How do they explain that?
→ {"text": "他們如何解釋那個？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 2

349. That our witnesses are all lying.
→ {"text": "說我們所有的證人都在說謊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

350. That's the only explanation.
→ {"text": "這是唯一的解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

351. That's the only explanation.
→ {"text": "這是唯一的解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

352. Nothing was ever sent to Wright-Patterson and nothing was ever cleaned up?
→ {"text": "從未有任何東西送往萊特-帕特森，也從未進行過任何清理？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

353. There's the FBI telex from the FBI bureau in Dallas, Texas, that went out the very evening, 6/17 p.m., that the weather balloon explanation had just come out from General Ramey's press conference.
→ {"text": "有一份來自德州達拉斯FBI分局的電報，發出時間是當天晚上下午6點17分，就在雷米將軍的記者會剛發布氣象氣球解釋之後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "General Ramey 保留原文"}

354. And it refuted that.
→ {"text": "電報駁斥了那個說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. Raimi had canceled the continuing flight on to Wright Field.
→ {"text": "雷米取消了繼續飛往Wright Field的航班。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Raimi = Ramey 拼寫變體"}

356. And that stated that based on their telephonic conversation between Wright Field and their FBI office, that this belief was not borne out.
→ {"text": "電報中陳述，根據Wright Field與FBI辦公室之間的電話交談，這個說法並未得到證實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. In other words, the balloon explanation was not what they've been talking about, it's not what they were hearing.
→ {"text": "換句話說，氣球的解釋不是他們一直在談論的，也不是他們所聽到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

358. When did they switch from the weather balloon to mogul?

## Speaker Group 8

359. In 1994.
→ {"text": "在1994年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

360. Ooh, quite a while.

## Speaker Group 10

361. Oh, yeah.
→ {"text": "哦，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

362. But that was mainly due to, again, Congressman Schiff pushing for release of the files.
→ {"text": "但那主要是因為希夫眾議員再次推動檔案的公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

363. They had to find something that was so highly classified, they'd explain why they went against Herculean efforts, and that was where the mythology grew that mogul was so highly classified.
→ {"text": "他們必須找到某個高度機密的東西，來解釋為何他們投入如此艱鉅的努力，這就是莫古爾被高度機密化的神話誕生之處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. Yes, the explanation was classified, but all the experiments going on in New Mexico simply were not.
→ {"text": "是的，解釋是機密的，但在新墨西哥州進行的所有實驗本身並非機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

365. The purpose was classified.
→ {"text": "目的是機密的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

366. Yep.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

367. But not the equipment.
→ {"text": "但設備不是機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

368. But they were using common weather balloons, I understand.
→ {"text": "但我理解他們使用的是普通的氣象氣球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

369. Not the materials.
→ {"text": "材料不是機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

370. Standard weather balloons at 20-foot intervals by strength.
→ {"text": "標準氣象氣球，以20英呎間隔用繩子串連。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

371. So the only thing classified was that they had some additional instrumentation on it for picking up this radiation stuff.
→ {"text": "所以唯一機密的是他們在上面有一些額外的儀器用於探測輻射物質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

372. No.
→ {"text": "不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

373. No, no, not at all.
→ {"text": "不，不，完全不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

374. Everything on the mogul arrays launched in New Mexico was off-the-shelf materials.
→ {"text": "在新墨西哥州發射的莫古爾陣列上的所有東西都是現成的材料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. There were weather balloons, there were what they called a Rawin radar target.
→ {"text": "有氣象氣球，有他們稱為雷文雷達目標的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Rawin = radar wind sounding"}


## Speaker Group 22

376. It was a program that was classified?
→ {"text": "那是一個機密計畫？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

377. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

378. The purpose.
→ {"text": "目的是機密的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

379. The purpose was classified.
→ {"text": "目的是機密的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

380. The objective.
→ {"text": "目標是機密的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

381. I got you.
→ {"text": "我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. Objective classified, okay.
→ {"text": "目標是機密的，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

383. But they said it was so highly classified, the people in New Mexico didn't even know the names, yet when you look at Albert Crary's diary, he uses the name mogul in there at least twice.
→ {"text": "但他們說這是高度機密，以至於新墨西哥州的人甚至不知道名稱，然而當你查看艾伯特·克雷里的日記時，他在裡面至少使用了兩次莫古爾這個名稱。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

384. So he's well aware of what the name was.
→ {"text": "所以他很清楚這個名稱是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. So it's an ongoing thing that they've done and been bought into by an awful lot of the press.
→ {"text": "所以這是他們一直在做的事情，而且被大量媒體所接受。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. Well, it was explained as project mogul.
→ {"text": "嗯，它被解釋為莫古爾計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. It simply does not work.
→ {"text": "這根本說不通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

388. Now, the project was so effective as it was designed to determine as far as from high altitude, should the Soviets detonate their first atomic bomb, we would pick up the shock wave from this acoustic listing device, this microphone, that when they did first detonate an atomic bomb in August of 1949, it wasn't mogul that picked it up.
→ {"text": "現在，這個計畫的設計目的是從高空偵測，一旦蘇聯引爆第一顆原子彈，我們將從這個聲學偵聽裝置、這個麥克風中接收到衝擊波，但當他們在1949年8月首次引爆原子彈時，並不是莫古爾偵測到的，這顯示該計畫效能不彰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. Mogul failed.
→ {"text": "莫古爾失敗了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. We picked it up as far as due to chatter, talk, and air sampling as far as higher radiation levels.
→ {"text": "我們是透過情報交談、討論和空氣採樣偵測到較高輻射水平而發現的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

391. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. By and by they get here.
→ {"text": "最終它們會到達這裡。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "可能指風載輻射塵"}

393. So the winds go around, yeah.
→ {"text": "所以風會繞過來，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. Why would it surprise anybody that we were trying to determine whether the Soviets were detonating a weapon?
→ {"text": "我們試圖確定蘇聯是否在引爆武器，這有什麼好驚訝的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

395. Why would that surprise people?
→ {"text": "為什麼這會讓人驚訝？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. Why should that be?
→ {"text": "為什麼應該如此？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. I was in the Congress for 20 years.
→ {"text": "我在國會服務了20年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. I was on the Armed Services Committee for 20 years.
→ {"text": "我在軍事委員會服務了20年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. I sat in a very large number of briefings.
→ {"text": "我參加了非常多的簡報會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. I can classify briefings.
