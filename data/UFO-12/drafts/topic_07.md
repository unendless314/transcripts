## Speaker Group 1

258. These were not animal remains in that rocket.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. I can say that with some confidence because I was involved in the first suborbital primate flight in Pensacola, Florida and I went there in 1959.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. It was about 1960 that we did the first suborbital primate flight early, early in our space venture.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. Was there a mogul launch that could have been responsible for this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. The evidence that has been presented, it was Dr. Albert Crary's diary who gave us the information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. The identified flight was supposedly flight number four on June 4th, 1947.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. According to Crary's diary, because of cloud cover, the missile launch had been canceled, so their flight was canceled.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. Charles Moore, who was a scientist, told me when that happened, they stripped the equipment from the balloons, from the arrays, but they couldn't let the helium out of the balloons, so they would let the balloons go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. Crary's diary then has a cryptic note about on the same day that we flew sonobuoy up there and couldn't get good reception, so there's some discussion about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. The first recorded flight for Project Mogul was flight number five.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. There had been three flights in New Jersey prior to them getting to New Mexico.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. The documentation is a little bit hinky on that, but according to what Charles Moore had said in a letter that he wrote in 1995, that they didn't file the NOTAM as they were required by the CAA at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. I'm sure he did this because we went through the archives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. I went to the archives looking for the notums because I'd like to see how they described the arrays and if there was a notum for the June 4th launch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. He said in a 1995 letter that they had not contacted the FAA because they didn't expect this mythical flight to get off the restricted area at White Sand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. Even if the flight was launched, it wasn't expected to reach any altitudes and it wasn't suspected to get off the White Sand's missile range, according to him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. I'm sure that he'd said that simply because that would explain why there was no FAA notification.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. There was no good documentation that flight number four ever was launched.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. There was no good documentation that it reached the Brazel Ranch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. There was no good documentation that Brazel was unable to identify the weather balloons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. The Mogul arrays were just weather balloons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. There were weather balloons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. There was 15, 20 weather balloons strung together, but it's still weather balloons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. Jesse Marcel would have recognized the weather balloons for what they were.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. Cavett obviously recognized the weather balloons, but the point is simply that had it been a Project Mogul flight, we would have been able to identify it specifically from the testimonies of the witnesses and the documentation available.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. Why would they need a several day cleanup if it was a Mogul balloon?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. They wouldn't have if it had been a Mogul.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. Was there in fact, is that well documented there was a several day cleanup with a number of military people?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. According to the witnesses, the people who were on the debris field cleaning it up, the men who were there that we were able to interview prior to their deaths, some of them on audio tape, some of them on video tape, they spent several days cleaning up the debris on the Brazel Ranch site.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. Before my dad died, I asked him, "Would any of the debris still be out there?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. And he says, "No, they vacuum the place up."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. That was his words.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. They vacuumed it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. Really thorough cleanup.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. Why do we assume that other intelligent life has to look something like us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. We don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. Isn't that a little arrogant?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. We don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. We don't?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. You're talking about humanoids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. You go with the flow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. You're talking about humanoids.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. That's what people say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. Oh.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. You go with the flow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. But they would have said, "They're two arms, two legs ahead in the body."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. The guys with three arms and three legs go to Jupiter, you know, for their vacation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. On the other hand, it may be that we are somebody's colony that they seated us here, a penal colony that they call dead boys and girls here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. I'm sure there are some debunkers who have suggested that if we're seeing humanoids, we're hallucinating because it's perfectly conceivable that other intelligent life could have a different form than we have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. But not necessarily.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. As Dr. Michael D. Swords, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan Kalamazoo, professor of natural history, biologists, has suggested, if we consider biological symmetry, that throughout the universe that there would be a common link, that there would potentially be a resemblance, that they would be humanoid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. That's conceivable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. That's conceivable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. That's what the evidence shows.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. It doesn't mean that there's nobody else out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. Non-humanoid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. It doesn't mean that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. In fact, if you take a look at all of the history of UFO sightings when they've reported occupants or creatures from inside, historically most of them have been humanoid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. There are some cases where one of them was described as a hairy jelly bean bag.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. Things like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. But the testimony from the people who've seen creatures from inside the craft normally report a humanoid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. Maybe taller than us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. Maybe shorter than us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. Maybe much more robust.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. But it's usually a humanoid creature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. There are some cases where they're robotic in nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. And in Pascagoula, the fellows there described something that really wasn't much in the way of a humanoid but resembled vaguely a human.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. I knew Steve Schiff, by the way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. I was on the committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. I was there when we had that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. I thought it was a hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. I'm told now that it wasn't a hearing, that it was a briefing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. But sometimes it's hard to tell briefings from hearings in your memory.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. I know that he was concerned about this and was pushing to learn something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. I mentioned before that there were two reasons, two things you could cite that tells you that the Air Force is not being truthful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. There are really three.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. The press release they made.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. The fact that they sent these people these findings to Wright-Patterson.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. And the third thing is they were cleaning it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. If it was a weather balloon, none of those things would have been -- none of those things would have happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. Well, the first one, there might have been some confusion, wild confusion, the first one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. But the second two, never.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. Never sent anything to Wright-Patterson.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. And they never would have cleaned up anything if it had been a weather balloon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. What challenge?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. How do they explain that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 2

349. That our witnesses are all lying.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

350. That's the only explanation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

351. That's the only explanation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

352. Nothing was ever sent to Wright-Patterson and nothing was ever cleaned up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

353. There's the FBI telex from the FBI bureau in Dallas, Texas, that went out the very evening, 6/17 p.m., that the weather balloon explanation had just come out from General Ramey's press conference.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. And it refuted that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. Raimi had canceled the continuing flight on to Wright Field.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. And that stated that based on their telephonic conversation between Wright Field and their FBI office, that this belief was not borne out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. In other words, the balloon explanation was not what they've been talking about, it's not what they were hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

358. When did they switch from the weather balloon to mogul?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

359. In 1994.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

360. Ooh, quite a while.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

361. Oh, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

362. But that was mainly due to, again, Congressman Schiff pushing for release of the files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 12

363. They had to find something that was so highly classified, they'd explain why they went against Herculean efforts, and that was where the mythology grew that mogul was so highly classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. Yes, the explanation was classified, but all the experiments going on in New Mexico simply were not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 13

365. The purpose was classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

366. Yep.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

367. But not the equipment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

368. But they were using common weather balloons, I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

369. Not the materials.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

370. Standard weather balloons at 20-foot intervals by strength.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

371. So the only thing classified was that they had some additional instrumentation on it for picking up this radiation stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

372. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

373. No, no, not at all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. Everything on the mogul arrays launched in New Mexico was off-the-shelf materials.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. There were weather balloons, there were what they called a Rawin radar target.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

376. It was a program that was classified?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

377. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

378. The purpose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

379. The purpose was classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

380. The objective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

381. I got you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Objective classified, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

383. But they said it was so highly classified, the people in New Mexico didn't even know the names, yet when you look at Albert Crary's diary, he uses the name mogul in there at least twice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. So he's well aware of what the name was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. So it's an ongoing thing that they've done and been bought into by an awful lot of the press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. Well, it was explained as project mogul.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. It simply does not work.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

388. Now, the project was so effective as it was designed to determine as far as from high altitude, should the Soviets detonate their first atomic bomb, we would pick up the shock wave from this acoustic listing device, this microphone, that when they did first detonate an atomic bomb in August of 1949, it wasn't mogul that picked it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. Mogul failed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. We picked it up as far as due to chatter, talk, and air sampling as far as higher radiation levels.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

391. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. By and by they get here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. So the winds go around, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. Why would it surprise anybody that we were trying to determine whether the Soviets were detonating a weapon?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

395. Why would that surprise people?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. Why should that be?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. I was in the Congress for 20 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. I was on the Armed Services Committee for 20 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. I sat in a very large number of briefings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. I can classify briefings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. I can tell you that I cannot remember a single thing that I was told that I think would give aid and comfort to the enemy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. We classify way too much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. There's an old accent that says what's everybody's business is nobody's business.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. When you classify everything, nothing is classified, and we're pretty darn close to that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

405. I think in 1947 the thought process was that they didn't -- we didn't want the Soviets to know that we had the capability to spy on them to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

406. But the fact that we were sending something up there to listen wouldn't mean we had a capability.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

407. Pretty sophisticated when you think about it just being a balloon with a kite.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 35

408. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. Thank you all very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. As we send the way through, this has been a very productive first three days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. Thank you all very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. [ Applause ]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
