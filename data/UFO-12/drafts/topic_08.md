414. I've got three brief points to make.
→ {"text": "我有三個簡短的論點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. One, is there any speculation out there why the UFO crashed?

416. Have you heard anything?
→ {"text": "你們有聽說過什麼嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 39

419. It ran into a radar beam.
→ {"text": "它撞上了雷達束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. I mean, that sounds a little strange, but we know that there was a launch scheduled for White Sands, and we know that they -- those were vacuum tube radars, so they were left on so they wouldn't have to warm up.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，這聽起來有點奇怪，但我們知道 White Sands 當時安排了發射任務，而且我們知道他們——那些是真空管雷達，所以會保持開啟狀態以避免暖機時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "White Sands（白沙靶場）保留原文；vacuum tube radars（真空管雷達）為術語表中的專業術語"}

421. They were not transistorized or anything like that.
→ {"text": "它們不是電晶體化或類似的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. So if pilot and a wingman -- 40% of the cases involve more than one object seen at a time.
→ {"text": "所以如果駕駛員和僚機——百分之四十的案例涉及同時看到不止一個物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. If they just happened to cross this beam -- this wasn't searching this way, just a beam aiming out there, maybe killing a pigeon or something.
→ {"text": "如果它們恰好穿過這道光束——這不是搜索式的掃描，只是一道固定瞄準的光束，可能連鴿子都能打下來之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. You run into the beam, and it discombobulates your guidance system, your propulsion system.
→ {"text": "你撞上光束，它就會干擾你的導航系統、你的推進系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. Maybe they go like this, the two pilot and wingman kind of thing.
→ {"text": "也許它們就像這樣，那種雙機編隊、主機與僚機的模式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. And so that sounds dumb, not sophisticated, if you will, but you have to expect surprises.
→ {"text": "所以這聽起來很蠢，如果你願意這麼說的話，不夠精密，但你必須預期會有意外。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. It's like drive through New Mexico and run into a hailstorm, and I got bumps all over my car.
→ {"text": "就像開車穿越 New Mexico 遇到冰雹，我的車被砸得到處都是凹痕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "New Mexico（新墨西哥州）保留原文"}

428. New Mexico?
→ {"text": "New Mexico？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. It's dry.
→ {"text": "那裡很乾燥。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. What kind of hailstorm?
→ {"text": "什麼樣的冰雹？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. It was a big hailstorm.
→ {"text": "那是一場大冰雹。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. There's another point here, too.
→ {"text": "這裡還有另一個論點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. General Groves, Manhattan Project Groves, as late as '48 was saying it would take the Russians eight years before they could build an atomic bomb, because they just don't have the industrial capacity that we do.
→ {"text": "格羅夫斯將軍，曼哈頓計畫的格羅夫斯，直到一九四八年都還在說俄國人需要八年才能製造原子彈，因為他們根本沒有我們擁有的工業能力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "General Groves、Manhattan Project 為術語表中的專有名詞"}

434. It took one.
→ {"text": "結果只花了一年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. There was an attitude in Washington.
→ {"text": "華盛頓當時有一種態度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. This is a bunch of dumb peasants, you know, not sophisticated, oh, maybe they've got spies here and there, but nothing to it.
→ {"text": "就是說這是一群愚蠢的農民，你知道的，不夠精明，喔，也許他們這裡那裡有些間諜，但沒什麼大不了的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. And so this really shook them up.
→ {"text": "所以這真的震撼了他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. So they said even if they got a bomb, they had no means for delivering it, casually forgetting that we'd left a B-29, but they then copied and built a bunch of, and shocked us when they displayed them in Moscow at their usual dog and pony show.
→ {"text": "所以他們說即使俄國人有了炸彈，他們也沒有投送手段，卻隨意地忽略了我們留下了一架 B-29，但他們後來仿製並建造了一批，當他們在莫斯科的例行展示會上展示這些飛機時，我們震驚了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "B-29 為飛機型號保留原文；dog and pony show 為慣用語，指宣傳展示"}

439. So the atomic bomb end of things was of great concern to the United States, because there was real concern that once we found out, and one of the scariest memos I've ever seen from all the archive research is a National Security Council memo in the early 1950 saying the Russians have made more progress in the past 18 months in the development of nuclear weapons and methods for delivering them that had been expected for five years.
→ {"text": "所以原子彈這件事對美國來說是極大的擔憂，因為一旦我們發現真相，確實令人擔憂，而我在所有檔案研究中見過最可怕的備忘錄之一，是一份一九五零年代初期的國家安全委員會備忘錄，指出俄國人在過去十八個月內於核武器及其投送方法的發展上取得的進展，超過了原本預期的五年進度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "National Security Council（國家安全委員會）為術語表中的專有名詞"}

440. They were concerned, and wouldn't you be under those conditions?
→ {"text": "他們很擔心，在那種情況下你不會擔心嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. Very much so.
→ {"text": "確實如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. If I might speculate, you wanted speculation, and here's my favorite speculation, they did it on purpose.
→ {"text": "如果我可以推測的話，你想要推測，這是我最喜歡的推測，他們是故意的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. They crashed on purpose.
→ {"text": "他們是故意墜毀的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. What they wanted, they wanted the most non-hostile way of announcing their presence to the earth and what is more, would make us feel easier if we picked up the craft and the bodies and realize that they are as delicate as we are, as fragile as we are, they're non-confrontational.
→ {"text": "他們想要的是，以最非敵意的方式向地球宣告他們的存在，而且更重要的是，如果我們撿到飛行器和遺體，並意識到他們和我們一樣脆弱、一樣易碎、非對抗性的，我們會感到更安心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. Now we have the information.
→ {"text": "現在我們掌握了這個資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. Their plan failed simply because they crashed at Roswell and the embargo on the news went down.
→ {"text": "他們的計畫失敗了，僅僅是因為他們在羅斯威爾墜毀，而新聞封鎖生效了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Roswell（羅斯威爾）為術語表中的專有名詞"}

447. But I've always liked that theory.
→ {"text": "但我一直喜歡那個理論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. I don't subscribe to it, you understand, but I've always liked that theory that they did it on purpose.
→ {"text": "我不贊同它，你明白的，但我一直喜歡那個他們故意這麼做的理論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. That's interesting.
→ {"text": "這很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. Please.
→ {"text": "請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. These might have been clones that were expendable.
→ {"text": "這些可能是可犧牲的複製體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. That's more of an American approach.
→ {"text": "那比較像是美國人的做法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. Let me point out earlier, I can't identify which one of you suggested it, but I think it was more than once.
→ {"text": "讓我指出稍早的情況，我無法確定是你們哪一位提出的，但我認為不只一次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. What should you do now after the hearings?
→ {"text": "聽證會之後你們現在應該做什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. We've got two more days of hearings and I want to stress that tomorrow we're hearing testimony from people from South America and that's in the morning and in the afternoon we're hearing from people from the rest of the world who've stepped forward to testify.
→ {"text": "我們還有兩天的聽證會，而我想強調明天我們將聽取來自南美洲人士的證詞，那是在上午，下午我們將聽取來自世界其他地區挺身作證的人士的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. So this is very important.
→ {"text": "所以這非常重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. Up till now it's been pretty much a homegrown American approach and I think it's much more significant from a world point of view.
→ {"text": "到目前為止，這幾乎都是美國本土的做法，而我認為從世界觀點來看這更加重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. So you're asking what effort.
→ {"text": "所以你在問要做什麼努力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. Again, I think I've alluded to this earlier, but the Congress I think is a dead letter to accomplish anything in that regard.
→ {"text": "再次強調，我認為我稍早有暗示過這點，但我認為國會在這方面是死路一條，無法完成任何事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. I say this with all due respect to the Congress who have a lot of fine people, but I think that the best effort we have for bringing visibility to the people of the world of this issue, you're probably not all that familiar with the various conferences that the UN have.
→ {"text": "我說這番話時對國會充滿敬意，國會有很多優秀的人，但我認為我們在將這個議題呈現給全世界人民的最佳努力，你們可能對聯合國舉辦的各種會議不太熟悉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. Remember they had the conference on the child, the conference on women?
→ {"text": "記得他們舉辦過兒童會議、婦女會議嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. They garner unbelievable attention in the buildup for these conferences.
→ {"text": "這些會議在籌備階段就獲得了難以置信的關注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. So I would ask that you use your good offices and certainly we may try to approach this that we could go to the United Nations.
→ {"text": "所以我想請求你們運用你們的職權影響力，當然我們可能會嘗試這個途徑，就是我們可以向聯合國提案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "United Nations（聯合國）為術語表中的專有名詞"}

464. Now I don't think we'd have a prayer in the Security Council because it's controlled by us and that just wouldn't happen.
→ {"text": "現在我認為我們在安理會沒有任何希望，因為它由我們控制，那根本不會發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Security Council（聯合國安理會）為術語表中的專有名詞"}

465. But what would happen in the General Assembly if we were to introduce a resolution or if we can't do it as Americans we could do it maybe through the Brazilian government or the Canadian government, they would introduce a resolution and the General Assembly, I'll bet you it would pass, they would fund some part of it, the rest of the funding could come from private sources and we would have the most awe-inspiring world event on this subject within a couple, three years.
→ {"text": "但如果我們在大會提出決議會發生什麼，或者如果我們作為美國人無法這麼做，我們可以透過巴西政府或加拿大政府來做，他們會提出決議，而在大會，我敢打賭它會通過，他們會資助一部分，其餘資金可以來自私人來源，我們將在兩三年內舉辦關於這個主題最令人敬畏的世界級活動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "General Assembly（聯合國大會）為術語表中的專有名詞"}

466. And so I would ask you, I would suggest that you use your good offices to work with us as individuals or as a group to try to bring this about.
→ {"text": "所以我想請求你們，我建議你們運用職權影響力與我們合作，無論是以個人身份還是團體身份，來努力實現這個目標。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. And we're not prejudging anything, we're just feeling that this issue addresses the entire civilization of what we are on this planet.
→ {"text": "而且我們沒有預先判斷任何事情，我們只是感覺到這個議題關乎我們在這個星球上的整個文明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. Let me thank everybody for today's participation.
→ {"text": "讓我感謝所有人今天的參與。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. Obviously later in the day the number of people diminished.
→ {"text": "顯然在今天稍晚時參與人數減少了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. But let me emphasize, tomorrow is a very, very significant day for a hearing because we are broadening out as Americans to a global identification.
→ {"text": "但讓我強調，明天對聽證會來說是非常、非常重要的一天，因為我們作為美國人正在擴展到全球性的認同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. So again, these hearings are adjourned.
→ {"text": "那麼再次，本聽證會休會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
