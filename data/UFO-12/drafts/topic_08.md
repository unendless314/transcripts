414. I've got three brief points to make.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. One, is there any speculation out there why the UFO crashed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. Have you heard anything?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 37

417. There's a lot of speculation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 38

418. Share one with us.

## Speaker Group 39

419. It ran into a radar beam.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. I mean, that sounds a little strange, but we know that there was a launch scheduled for White Sands, and we know that they -- those were vacuum tube radars, so they were left on so they wouldn't have to warm up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. They were not transistorized or anything like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. So if pilot and a wingman -- 40% of the cases involve more than one object seen at a time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. If they just happened to cross this beam -- this wasn't searching this way, just a beam aiming out there, maybe killing a pigeon or something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. You run into the beam, and it discombobulates your guidance system, your propulsion system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. Maybe they go like this, the two pilot and wingman kind of thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. And so that sounds dumb, not sophisticated, if you will, but you have to expect surprises.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. It's like drive through New Mexico and run into a hailstorm, and I got bumps all over my car.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. New Mexico?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. It's dry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. What kind of hailstorm?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. It was a big hailstorm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. There's another point here, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. General Groves, Manhattan Project Groves, as late as '48 was saying it would take the Russians eight years before they could build an atomic bomb, because they just don't have the industrial capacity that we do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. It took one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. There was an attitude in Washington.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. This is a bunch of dumb peasants, you know, not sophisticated, oh, maybe they've got spies here and there, but nothing to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. And so this really shook them up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. So they said even if they got a bomb, they had no means for delivering it, casually forgetting that we'd left a B-29, but they then copied and built a bunch of, and shocked us when they displayed them in Moscow at their usual dog and pony show.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. So the atomic bomb end of things was of great concern to the United States, because there was real concern that once we found out, and one of the scariest memos I've ever seen from all the archive research is a National Security Council memo in the early 1950 saying the Russians have made more progress in the past 18 months in the development of nuclear weapons and methods for delivering them that had been expected for five years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. They were concerned, and wouldn't you be under those conditions?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. Very much so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. If I might speculate, you wanted speculation, and here's my favorite speculation, they did it on purpose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. They crashed on purpose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. What they wanted, they wanted the most non-hostile way of announcing their presence to the earth and what is more, would make us feel easier if we picked up the craft and the bodies and realize that they are as delicate as we are, as fragile as we are, they're non-confrontational.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. Now we have the information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. Their plan failed simply because they crashed at Roswell and the embargo on the news went down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. But I've always liked that theory.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. I don't subscribe to it, you understand, but I've always liked that theory that they did it on purpose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. That's interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. Please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. These might have been clones that were expendable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. That's more of an American approach.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. Let me point out earlier, I can't identify which one of you suggested it, but I think it was more than once.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. What should you do now after the hearings?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. We've got two more days of hearings and I want to stress that tomorrow we're hearing testimony from people from South America and that's in the morning and in the afternoon we're hearing from people from the rest of the world who've stepped forward to testify.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. So this is very important.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. Up till now it's been pretty much a homegrown American approach and I think it's much more significant from a world point of view.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. So you're asking what effort.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. Again, I think I've alluded to this earlier, but the Congress I think is a dead letter to accomplish anything in that regard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. I say this with all due respect to the Congress who have a lot of fine people, but I think that the best effort we have for bringing visibility to the people of the world of this issue, you're probably not all that familiar with the various conferences that the UN have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. Remember they had the conference on the child, the conference on women?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. They garner unbelievable attention in the buildup for these conferences.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. So I would ask that you use your good offices and certainly we may try to approach this that we could go to the United Nations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. Now I don't think we'd have a prayer in the Security Council because it's controlled by us and that just wouldn't happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. But what would happen in the General Assembly if we were to introduce a resolution or if we can't do it as Americans we could do it maybe through the Brazilian government or the Canadian government, they would introduce a resolution and the General Assembly, I'll bet you it would pass, they would fund some part of it, the rest of the funding could come from private sources and we would have the most awe-inspiring world event on this subject within a couple, three years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. And so I would ask you, I would suggest that you use your good offices to work with us as individuals or as a group to try to bring this about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. And we're not prejudging anything, we're just feeling that this issue addresses the entire civilization of what we are on this planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. Let me thank everybody for today's participation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. Obviously later in the day the number of people diminished.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. But let me emphasize, tomorrow is a very, very significant day for a hearing because we are broadening out as Americans to a global identification.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. So again, these hearings are adjourned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
