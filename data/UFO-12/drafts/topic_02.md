## Speaker Group 1

34. Thank you. We'll proceed into, unless there's any of the others that want to give quick testimony because we've already heard your warns, we'll proceed to a Q&A and to a dialogue.

35. Unless there's anybody that has something that's burning in their heart that they want to tell, or can we engage in a dialogue? We'll start with the congressman from Utah, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. Ten minutes, Mr. Chair. We'll have ten minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. We'll have ten minutes? Don't tell them ten minutes. They'll take ten.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. That'll take us to five o'clock.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. Colonel French, this is really something that you've just said here that's very important.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. It's highly significant. I hadn't known until I read this and listened to you just now exactly what you are saying. I'm going to ask you just some specific questions. I want to start by saying I commend you for all the service you've given our country in uniform and for the things you've done that way. This is such a significant statement that I'm going to ask some rather specific questions if that's all right. Can you remember about when in the late '60s this event occurred? As close as you can. I mean, that's fine. It was just late '60s. If you know something a little more I'd be most interested.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. Well about when was it that you said it had to do with training in the late '60s that you were sent to Alamogordo?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. Okay, that's good enough. You learned of the accident a few miles away from Alamogordo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. When did you learn of that accident? I mean, was it right at the time of the accident or was it later? Give me a little time frame here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. Well, it was within a matter of hours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. Oh, the same day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. Yeah, oh yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. Okay, I just want to make sure I understood that. Because I would fix this to say the same day. That's significant. Okay, you witnessed the takeoff of the prototype to the fighter aircraft that actually engaged that unidentified object that was flying up there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. Afterwards, you were asked to review some of the items. Now, this is the afterwards I'm really interested in. When afterwards were you asked to review some of the items that were picked up from the crash site?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. Ones that I've been told about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. Oh, just a minute. Well, this statement, it says a short time later, I witnessed -- no, no, no, excuse me. Afterwards, I was asked to review some of the items that were picked up from the crash site. There were an unknown number of humanoids, either killed or injured.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. Did you see those?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. No, I didn't see them. I said that I was told about them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. Oh, okay. Okay, and I understand that. And that's just fine. I just want to know exactly what happened here. The way this reads, I was wondering if you might have seen them yourself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. You did not?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. As I said, I had seen a lot of UFOs under other circumstances, but not at that time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. No, that doesn't apply.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. Okay, you reviewed items. And what were the items that you reviewed that were picked up that made you believe -- well, explain then how -- well, how did you hear about the humanoids?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. Let me ask it that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. I was told that that was what was found.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. By who?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. People who were there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. The -- Air Force people?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. Yeah, well, there were people who were enlisted people and various people who were there standing on the ramp.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. Oh, that were picking up -- No, I don't know what they were doing, but I say that there were -- needless to say, there was a lot of gossip and a lot of things going on that I was not a party to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. Okay, so essentially you were told on that same day of the crash that there were an unknown number of humanoids either killed or injured?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. Okay. Did you see or did somebody just tell you that the parts and casualties were taken to base operations?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. I don't know. For instance, one of the people that I saw that I -- a certain would have seen it happened to be a nurse that was in uniform. It was in uniform at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. She told you right then?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. No, no. I say she would have known, but she wouldn't talk to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. Oh, okay. Well, you could only find out something if somebody either tells you or shows you -- I had a natural curiosity as to what was happening, but they were very closed-mouthed, very secretive about everything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. Okay. And you had learned that parts and casualties were transported to Wright-Patterson Air Force base. Again, I'd be most interested to know where you learned that or how you learned it or the circumstances of learning it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. Well, later on, I had a very close friend who was a full colonel and who happened -- Paul Sleeper was a very good friend of his. And he and I discussed that a little bit, and he said, "Yes, that's where the parts went." He was a full colonel, Dr. George Kristof.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. Dr. George Kristof told you that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. At that same time, essentially? That same year, at least?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. Well, it's later, but I don't remember exactly how much later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. Okay. Maybe after he had been through with his whatever non-disclosure he had to take care of. Okay. Well, let me just turn back a little bit to Stanton Friedman and anybody that might want to answer any of these questions. What evidence do we have since '47, certainly in the '60s or at the time of this Alamogordo incident or anything of -- what is the evidence that we have that's as solid as we have? What is the most solid evidence of the humanoid parts and so on that somebody told Colonel French about? Can we get to a direct person that might have said something either to Colonel French or anybody else about Alamogordo or anything that has to do with humanoids? Let's get into that. I want to know the best evidence there is out there today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. We've got lots of good abduction stories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. Now, you know, there might be things being withheld. That's not -- you know, and I understand all that. I just want to know -- and that might be the fault of the Army. That might be why we don't know. But I'm interested in what we absolutely do know about humanoids, even if -- Testimony from people who have been abducted is as close as you get. I mean -- Well, who's saying that? Okay. Well, give me the names.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. There's a book out there captured, "The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience." It's about two people who were abducted. They were carefully investigated by Dr. Benjamin Simon, a psychiatrist who ran a hospital for 3,000 shell shock war veterans. He says the emotional upheaval in their voices as he had 10 sessions with each of them was as strong as that in any of the war veterans that he had dealt with with PTSD. He's in the Army movie about PTSD. He knows that field, doesn't know flying saucers. And they saw -- they were close, intimately close to humanoids, to occupants from a vehicle from up there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. Okay. Mr. Freeman, what are the names of those people that said they were abducted and then obviously came back to explain about that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. Betty -- their names were Betty and Barney Hill, a couple in New Hampshire. The book is captured, "The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience," by myself. And the woman who did most of the work was Kathleen Marden, who's Betty's niece. She has the hypnosis tapes. It's a long story, an involved story, but one of the best ones around in terms of the quality of the people. Betty was a social worker.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. Okay. And we can follow up and even read the book and so on. What other examples do we have?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
