## Speaker Group 1

98. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to hear from, again, any one of you that want to talk about this. What are the things that you were -- I'd like to know what you wanted to say in this panel that you didn't say on the first panel. So Mr. Colonel Marcel, do you want to talk about what -- anything that you want to talk about that you didn't talk about on the first panel? Well, I just have formed a lot of opinions about UFOs and extraterrestrial visitations. And what I'd like to emphasize is the fact that the universe is such a large place. There's 10 to 20 second-power stars, which is about the number of grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. And just to say that one -- if they represent all the stars, there are all the grains of sand on the beach, if you only say that one has life around it like us and the rest of them are devoid of life, then I think

99. we're sadly mistaken. Because the enormous possibilities of all life is everywhere, everywhere.

100. Thank you. Kevin Randle, anything you want to add that you didn't say earlier?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. One of the things that I wanted to kind of talk about, which I think diverts us a tad bit, is this Project Mogul nonsense. And the Air Force explanation that Project Mogul explains it all, that Project Mogul was highly classified, and that's why the officers at Roswell were unable to identify the wreckage when they saw it. But it turns out Project Mogul was -- although it was highly classified, the purpose, the equipment and the experiments being carried out in New Mexico was not classified. They were mentioned in the newspaper on July 10th as an explanation for what was found at Roswell. Charles Moore, who was the -- one of the scientists on Project Mogul, had said that it was so highly classified, they didn't even know the name. Yet, if you review Dr. Crary's diary from 1947, what you see is the name Mogul appearing periodically in it. The Air Forces used this as the cover. They said
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. originally in 1947 it was a weather balloon. Then they said, well, we lied about that, it wasn't a weather balloon. And then they gave us another one, another weather balloon as an explanation. And that seems to have set in now after the last 10 years with the media that, well, Roswell's explained as a weather balloon. And the answer is they can't even point to a flight of these balloons that have not been identified as such. So the Project Mogul explanation simply doesn't work. We looked at -- and I say we, Don and Stan and I have looked for alternative explanations for the Roswell case. We went to White Sands Missile Range to see if there was a missile launch that would account for the debris found on the Brazel Ranch. We went to the archives in Alamogordo on the space program to see if they were launching any kind of creatures, whether they were mice or mayflies or chimpanzees
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. that would account for the wreckage. And we could find absolutely nothing. I had always said if we could find an explanation for this -- maybe they had tested an astronaut in 1947 and he was killed in the test. And if we could find something like that, we could write best-selling books about it and make a lot of money. But we could find nothing that explains the Roswell wreckage when you account for all the testimony, all the people who were involved, what they told us, the limited documentation we have. But when you look at all of that together, none of the explanations offered explains it in terrestrial terms.

104. Yes, Mr. Friedman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. Another point that should be made is that I contacted somebody who looked at the newspaper in Alamogordo, which is right next to Holloman Air Force Base. And it turns out they staged the launch of a radar-reflector-weather-balloon combination -- On July 10th.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. The newspaper, July 10th. And fantasy of flying disk explained here was the headline. And they showed a picture of one of these balloon trains. And it just doesn't fit. If you look at the facts about what they launched and what was observed, they don't match. They don't match at all. But the fact that they went to the trouble of staging a launch tells you something. It was very important. Why bother? If it's just a dumb old weather balloon, who cares? It makes no sense. So they went to a lot of trouble to try to cover it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. And when Cavett, the CIC man, comes up with this real crazy story that he knew it was a balloon right away, it only covered an area 20 feet in diameter, even though the newspaper said 200, mind you, fit in one car, nothing to it. If that's all there had been, the rancher would have brought in his wreckage and his little truck.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. And there would have been no reason for Jesse Marcel and Captain Cavett to follow them all the way out in the middle of nowhere. There's a lot of nowhere in New Mexico.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. Right. Which is...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. And they stayed overnight, had their sleeping bags. That's making a big deal about nothing when Cavett lies and says it would fit in one vehicle, 20 feet square. But the New York Times didn't comment about it. Everybody carried that explanation. So one of the things we're dealing with here is a failure of the press to ask even the obvious questions. You know, the colonel, the head of the 509th can't identify a weather balloon? These guys had fought in the Pacific. They weren't right off the training base. Jesse Marcel couldn't identify a weather balloon. They got away with it. But this is in the '90s, mind you. So the press is still not doing its job.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. I can understand in '47, we just fought a great war. You know, you believe the government...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. Didn't everybody believe the government back then? But in '97, that they could get away with this, it really bugs me. And a little inside story. I'm waiting. They have reissued, Cosimo Publishers has reissued those two volumes of the Roswell Report. The second one was case closed. The first one said they were not going to say anything more. Three years later, this is the second one. On the top, it says, "With the new introduction by nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman, author of Crash at Corona, the definitive study, the Roswell Incident." I'm waiting for somebody in the Air Force, because my comments are very strong, about lies by the Air Force, about in this report. I'm waiting for somebody to say, "Hey, look what he said about us. If I don't make it home, you'll know why."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. In keeping, as far as even on the CIC, on the Sheridan-Cavett theme, as Kevin remembers the numerous times that we actually sat down and met with then Lieutenant Colonel Sheridan Cavett, he and his wife, Mary, whether in their home up in Sequim, Washington, or their winter home on Sierra Vista, yes. Yeah, he retired Lieutenant Colonel. And the very first meeting, how we spent the better part of an afternoon, his denying he was even there, that he had yet to even arrive at Roswell. Didn't matter. You're talking about someone else, someone who was there before me. And as we were leaving, he walked us out to the car and he says to us, "Boys, I need to know one thing. Should you find anything that should threaten national security, you will keep it to yourselves, won't you?" And we looked at one another and, "Yes, Colonel, of course, of course." And we got in the car and we looked
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. at one another and said, "He knows. He knows." And then as we would visit and press more and more and we'd speak with him over the phone and demonstrate not only was he there, but he was involved and to the point that, "Well, I went out there, but it wasn't really anything." Well, at one point he even said, "Well, it could have been a flying saucer, but I wasn't involved," that type of thing. The very last time we met with him and he and his wife were outside at the car and I said to him, "Colonel, I really have to hand it to you. You've been a man who's kept your oath all these years. You're a true patriot."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. And he thanked me and I said, "But, Colonel, what gives you the right withholding it from my generation, all of us who weren't even there in 1947? You've decided for all of us."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. And he paused for a moment and he says, "I've never thought of it that way before, but I'm still not going to tell you anything." And then his wife, Mary, blurts out, "Tell the boys about the colonel from the Pentagon who was just here to talk with you." And he turns and gives her this look, this searing look, and it was Colonel Richard Weaver in preparation of the Project Mogul Report, to which Colonel Cavett had become their lone star witness. And he snaps at us and, "Yes, and I told him exactly what I'm telling you. I wasn't involved."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. Well, that's not what's in the Project Mogul Report, according to what he told Colonel Weaver. He was the one who immediately identified it as nothing more than this mogul balloon, and in fact, he kept it to himself. He didn't even bother telling the base commander or Major Marcel, but that he saw that it was nothing more than a weather balloon. So we caught him in a flat lie. He nonetheless is the only witness to this being a mogul balloon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. But as he told us, as he said, as I told Colonel Weaver, "I wasn't involved." So who should we believe?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. And in fact, we have Colonel Kavett on tape. It was right after Weaver had seen him, and he was talking about how he wasn't there. We said, "Well, they talk about this West Texas boy who was a good horseman in Kavett says, 'Well, that sounds like me, but I wasn't there.'" And then this was after Weaver had interviewed him. We look at the testimony in the report, and Kavett says, "Well, I noticed it was a weather balloon immediately.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. The next question should have been, did you communicate this rather vital piece of intelligence to Jesse Marcel?" But they go off on another tangent. Kavett made it clear that the CIC was a Class II facility on Roswell, which means he did not report to Blanchard in the chain of command. Blanchard was required to support his activity. But he should have said something to Blanchard before he sends people out to clean the mess up and before he issues a press release and says, "Well, we've got a flying saucer."
