## Speaker Group 1

88. In keeping with the Roswell theme, as we've talked about, the rancher, Mack Brazel -- What year?

89. Yes, 1947.

90. Yeah, okay, thank you. 1947, time of the incident. When the rancher first reported the fine to Sheriff George Wilcox -- And the rancher -- William W. W. Mack Brazel, Sheriff George Wilcox, and a reporter by the name of Frank Joyce from radio station KGFL, placed a phone call to get some late breaking news for his next report. And the sheriff said, "I think there's someone here you should speak with."

91. And according to Joyce, he didn't get the name of the individual on the other line, but at first he was quite angry. He was upset about the fact, as described earlier, that he had to drive the sheep a couple of miles around all this wreckage. Who was responsible?

92. Who was going to come and clean it all up? I'm the supervisor and everything. And then it became more and more somber, and he started talking about it was horrible. It was horrible.

93. You wouldn't believe it. And Joyce finally, "What are you talking about? Something else?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. To which he then would suggest, "Are you talking about bodies?" To which Joyce then suggested, "Well, you know they're launching those rockets over at White Sands. Maybe they've launched an animal. Maybe they're sending monkeys up in those rockets." To which Brazl fired back, "They weren't any monkeys. They weren't human. They weren't human. They weren't human. They weren't human." Since then, Brazl's own granddaughter, Fawn Fritz, has described to us that she overheard her grandfather also make the remark about the poor, unfortunate creatures. We've also talked to young ranch boys at that time, Dee Proctor and Sidney Jack Wright, who were supposedly with Brazl when he would discover a couple of bodies a few miles from the debris field at another location, another location, at Frankie Rowe.

95. And so that you're saying that they did talk about it right at that time? Yes, yes. Oh, okay. That's a little different than what you said. Well, because it could take up a whole panel. I've already gone over my time, but I'm most interested. I was just going to say what you seem to be asking me was, "Do we have any contemporary records from that time?" Somebody wrote in their diary, "I saw bodies." If you want to talk about people who saw the bodies in 1947, yeah, we can give you lots of names. That's all I wanted is people that said it at the time, and nobody questions they said it at the time. And you had said, "Well, we've got them saying it later." And I just wanted to clarify this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. Is it clarified? Yes. Because as I pointed out, Major Marcel, the father of Colonel Marcel, said it at the time, and it became well known at the time. That's what I'm looking for, something that was said at the time on a humanoid or some kind of a life form or something associated with one of these sightings. Could I take a minute? Please. Wow. It's up to the chair.

97. Thank you. We had mentioned Frankie Rowe. Her father was a firefighter with the Roswell Fire Department. His name was Dan Dwyer. And the Fire Department adjoined the courthouse at that time. There was one phone line that ran into both. You couldn't report an incident to one without both hearing about it. So there was the report of a crash north of town. There was a talk about something that had gone down north of town. And the Fire Department investigated it. They went to check it out. According to Frankie Rowe, who was still alive, that when her father returned, the military already was securing the site, but that he described that they had seen the bodies. And it was later, whether it was that evening or shortly thereafter, they were visited by the military, by a military officer and a number of other MPs. And they were very sternly warned about not talking about this.
