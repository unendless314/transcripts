## Speaker Group 1

88. In keeping with the Roswell theme, as we've talked about, the rancher, Mack Brazel -- What year?
→ {"text": "延續我們討論的羅斯威爾主題，如我們所提到的，牧場主 Mack Brazel——是哪一年？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. Yes, 1947.
→ {"text": "是的，1947年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. Yeah, okay, thank you. 1947, time of the incident. When the rancher first reported the fine to Sheriff George Wilcox -- And the rancher -- William W. W. Mack Brazel, Sheriff George Wilcox, and a reporter by the name of Frank Joyce from radio station KGFL, placed a phone call to get some late breaking news for his next report. And the sheriff said, "I think there's someone here you should speak with."
→ {"text": "好的，謝謝。1947年，事件發生的時間。當牧場主首次向喬治·威爾考克斯警長報告他的發現時——牧場主 William W. Mack Brazel、喬治·威爾考克斯警長，以及來自 KGFL 電台的記者 Frank Joyce，Joyce 打了一通電話想要獲取一些最新消息以便進行下一次報導。警長說：「我想這裡有個人你應該跟他談談。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 'the fine' 應為 'the find'（發現物）的筆誤"}

91. And according to Joyce, he didn't get the name of the individual on the other line, but at first he was quite angry. He was upset about the fact, as described earlier, that he had to drive the sheep a couple of miles around all this wreckage. Who was responsible?
→ {"text": "根據 Joyce 的說法，他沒有得知電話另一端那個人的名字，但起初對方相當憤怒。他很不滿的是，如同先前所述，他必須驅趕羊群繞過所有這些殘骸走了幾英里。誰該負責？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. Who was going to come and clean it all up? I'm the supervisor and everything. And then it became more and more somber, and he started talking about it was horrible. It was horrible.
→ {"text": "誰要來清理這一切？我是監督者，諸如此類。然後談話變得越來越沉重，他開始說這太可怕了。太可怕了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. You wouldn't believe it. And Joyce finally, "What are you talking about? Something else?"
→ {"text": "你不會相信的。最後 Joyce 問：「你在說什麼？還有別的東西嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. To which he then would suggest, "Are you talking about bodies?" To which Joyce then suggested, "Well, you know they're launching those rockets over at White Sands. Maybe they've launched an animal. Maybe they're sending monkeys up in those rockets." To which Brazl fired back, "They weren't any monkeys. They weren't human. They weren't human. They weren't human. They weren't human." Since then, Brazl's own granddaughter, Fawn Fritz, has described to us that she overheard her grandfather also make the remark about the poor, unfortunate creatures. We've also talked to young ranch boys at that time, Dee Proctor and Sidney Jack Wright, who were supposedly with Brazl when he would discover a couple of bodies a few miles from the debris field at another location, another location, at Frankie Rowe.
→ {"text": "於是他詢問道：「你在說遺體嗎？」Joyce 接著說：「嗯，你知道他們在白沙靶場發射那些火箭。也許他們發射了動物。也許他們在那些火箭裡送上了猴子。」Brazel 立即反駁：「那不是猴子。它們不是人類。它們不是人類。它們不是人類。它們不是人類。」自那時起，Brazel 的親孫女 Fawn Fritz 向我們描述說，她無意中聽到祖父也提到那些可憐的、不幸的生物。我們也訪問了當時年輕的牧場男孩 Dee Proctor 和 Sidney Jack Wright，據說他們當時與 Brazel 在一起，當時 Brazel 在距離殘骸場幾英里外的另一個地點發現了幾具遺體——另一個地點。還有 Frankie Rowe。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文句子結構較複雜，最後部分略顯混亂，已盡量保持原意並提升可讀性"}

95. And so that you're saying that they did talk about it right at that time? Yes, yes. Oh, okay. That's a little different than what you said. Well, because it could take up a whole panel. I've already gone over my time, but I'm most interested. I was just going to say what you seem to be asking me was, "Do we have any contemporary records from that time?" Somebody wrote in their diary, "I saw bodies." If you want to talk about people who saw the bodies in 1947, yeah, we can give you lots of names. That's all I wanted is people that said it at the time, and nobody questions they said it at the time. And you had said, "Well, we've got them saying it later." And I just wanted to clarify this.
→ {"text": "所以你是說他們當時就談論過這件事？是的，是的。哦，好的。這跟你之前說的有點不同。嗯，因為這可能會佔用整個小組的時間。我已經超時了，但我最感興趣的是——我正要說的是，你似乎在問我的是：「我們有當時的任何當代記錄嗎？」有人在日記裡寫著「我看到了遺體。」如果你想談論那些在1947年看到遺體的人，是的，我們可以給你很多名字。我想要的就是當時說過的人，而且沒有人質疑他們當時說過。而你說過：「嗯，我們讓他們後來說的。」我只是想澄清這一點。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "對話形式，涉及多次換句和插話，保持口語化表達"}

96. Is it clarified? Yes. Because as I pointed out, Major Marcel, the father of Colonel Marcel, said it at the time, and it became well known at the time. That's what I'm looking for, something that was said at the time on a humanoid or some kind of a life form or something associated with one of these sightings. Could I take a minute? Please. Wow. It's up to the chair.
→ {"text": "澄清了嗎？是的。因為如我所指出的，Major Marcel，也就是 Colonel Marcel 的父親，當時就說過，而且在當時就廣為人知。這就是我在尋找的，關於類人生物或某種生命形式，或與這些目擊事件之一相關的、當時說過的東西。我可以花一分鐘嗎？請。哇。這取決於主席。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. Thank you. We had mentioned Frankie Rowe. Her father was a firefighter with the Roswell Fire Department. His name was Dan Dwyer. And the Fire Department adjoined the courthouse at that time. There was one phone line that ran into both. You couldn't report an incident to one without both hearing about it. So there was the report of a crash north of town. There was a talk about something that had gone down north of town. And the Fire Department investigated it. They went to check it out. According to Frankie Rowe, who was still alive, that when her father returned, the military already was securing the site, but that he described that they had seen the bodies. And it was later, whether it was that evening or shortly thereafter, they were visited by the military, by a military officer and a number of other MPs. And they were very sternly warned about not talking about this.
→ {"text": "謝謝。我們提到過 Frankie Rowe。她的父親是羅斯威爾消防局的消防員。他的名字是 Dan Dwyer。當時消防局與法院毗鄰。有一條電話線接入兩處。你無法向其中一方報告事件而不讓另一方也聽到。所以有關於城鎮北部發生墜毀的報告。有關於某物在城鎮北部墜落的傳聞。消防局展開調查。他們前往查看。根據仍然健在的 Frankie Rowe 所述，當她父親返回時，軍方已經在封鎖現場，但他描述說他們看到了遺體。後來，無論是當晚還是不久之後，他們被軍方拜訪——一名軍官和一些憲兵。他們被非常嚴厲地警告不得談論此事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
