    off to college in the East.

    is with billions and billions of galaxies and galactic clusters and stars, and many of them-- and we identified a few--
    many of them so far that possibly could have living systems on them, living beings.

    going and eventually be able to leave our planet and go somewhere else and investigate somewhere else, because we're not
    alone in the universe.

  source_text: According to another source here, according to a special UFO subcommittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics
    and Astronautics, world's largest group of space scientists, 30% of the 117 cases studied by the University of Colorado,
    government-sponsored study in the late '60s, and discussed in the Condon Report, Edward U. Condon, could not be identified,
    and yet the headline said, "Scientific study shows no UFOs."

    the science and environment website, earthfiles.com, and also reports monthly for premier radio networks broadcast of
    Coast to Coast AM in Los Angeles, I can, before you today, assert that the pressure of facts accumulated from military
    and intelligent eyewitnesses, from ranchers and pathologists, from pilots and astronauts, from fellow human experiencers
    in the UFO abduction syndrome, and from leaks by scientists and computer experts who have worked on back engineering extraterrestrial
    technologies extracted from non-human craft, there is no doubt that the United States government since World War II and
    the FDR and Truman administrations has known about the extraterrestrial interactions with earth and that their policies
    of denial in the alleged interest of national security
