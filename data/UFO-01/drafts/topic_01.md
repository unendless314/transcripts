1. It's going to be an educational week, for sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

2. And we are, as Chairman Bartlett said, we're going to be sitting like we are in committee, and we're going to pattern what we're doing today after a formal congressional hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

3. And first of all, we have with us Congresswoman Darlene Hooley, and we have Senator Gravel, Mike Gravel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

4. We have Congresswoman Carolyn Kilpatrick, and we have Congressman Merrill Cook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

5. And we are all retired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

6. So among us, we have 80 years or more experience, but 80 years just on the federal level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

7. And Roscoe and I, we're classmates.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

8. We have 20 years each.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. And I have to tell you, it is our commitment today, as if we were part of a hearing in the House of Representatives, it's our commitment to listen through objective ears and to ask the kinds of questions that we think that the American people would like us to ask so that they can become better informed, because obviously there's going to be a press on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. And we would like to make the public more aware, and we would like to have a hearing that could lead possibly to legislation or policymaking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. So if we're objective, if we're businesslike, and we stick to the issue, I think we're going to have a very, very interesting week.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. And right now, though, we get to swear in the first two witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. And initially, I think, Dr. Edgar Mitchell will be brought in on Skype.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. Good morning, Dr. Mitchell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. Good morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. I am a former astronaut, flew to the moon on Apollo 14.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. And so I have a little bit of out-of-the-earth experience, but also I grew up near Roswell, New Mexico on a ranch, and the so-called Roswell incident of 1947 occurred when I was a senior in high school and getting ready to go off to college in the East.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. So and I have been interested in this subject for many years, but let me set up the basic credentials-- for the first time in our human history, our technology is showing us how huge our universe-- well, let's just call it a multiverse-- is with billions and billions of galaxies and galactic clusters and stars, and many of them-- and we identified a few-- many of them so far that possibly could have living systems on them, living beings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. And we have a history that I'm aware of, particularly starting with the Roswell incident, but even long before that, that we have been visited by aliens or visitors from different star systems and different planets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. And of course, if we continue our endeavors, we will in due course be able to go outside our solar system as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. At the moment, our technology is not allowing us to do that, but in due course, we will be able to do that, I'm quite sure, and we must because our sun will only last a few more billion years, and we're even doing things to it that cause it to be-- a life on this planet to be unsustainable, either way we're going by using non-renewable resources and so forth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. And so we have to rethink about this whole issue of our being here on this planet at this point in time, and how do we continue our life here, and how do we continue being stalwart citizens of planet Earth and keeping our civilization going and eventually be able to leave our planet and go somewhere else and investigate somewhere else, because we're not alone in the universe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. They have been coming here for a long, long time, it seems, the evidence would suggest that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. We have been having visitors for a long, long time, perhaps hundreds, maybe even thousands of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. There's some that would even say that the pyramid is both in Egypt and in South America, that the aliens aided us in building those, and that seems to have a reasonable ring to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. But in any event, we're not alone in the universe, and we're only now beginning to get enough evidence through our science and our understanding of the way the universe is put together to recognize we really are alone, and that we can, in due course, just like others have, it appears.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. They come here, we go there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. And so I think we'll have a lot of testimony here today regarding that fact, and I urge you to listen to it, and let's open this up to the larger picture that, and acknowledge, yes, we're not alone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. We are, they are here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. We can't go there, and in due course, we will.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. And for the last, I've been very interested in this for the last 16 or 17 years on a basis of speaking about it publicly, and since I went to the moon 47 years ago, and my co-colleague Gordon Cooper also had an incident when he was at Edwards Air Force Base as a duty officer at a UFO land while he was on duty.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. So there's a number of us that have had these types of experiences to say, yes, we're not alone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. We have been visited, and let's go forward in understanding this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. And I hope you have a good week, and I'll stay, stay with you as long as I can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 2

37. Good morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. I'm Paul Hellyer, former Minister of Defense of Canada.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. And a long-time participant in politics and governance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. Over many decades of service to the Canadian people, I have come to understand and appreciate the importance of open, transparent government and the power of truth as antidote to the many afflictions the body politic is heir to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. The true currency of the 21st century will not be gold or silver or a basket of currencies, however useful they may be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. It will be trust.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. Without that commodity, progress and right action are undermined and delayed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. There is only one way to regain trust, find and tell the truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. Whether to your friends or family or to the citizens of nations, I believe this citizens hearing serves that purpose, and like my friend, Edgar Mitchell, I say without equivocation, we are not alone in the cosmos.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. We have neighbors.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. We should try to get to understand them and to cooperate with them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. I think it was about 33 years ago I was camping in West Virginia on a mountain 4,000 feet high.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. I got up in the middle of the night and went out and I just couldn't believe what I saw.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. The stars looked so darn close it looked like I could reach up and touch them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. And there really was a Milky Way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. I can't see it here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. There is too much pollution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. There is way too many lights here to see the Milky Way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. We're just one star, a fairly mediocre star in the Milky Way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. If the Milky Way was the United States, we're a fairly mediocre star somewhere in South Georgia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. And there are a million other galaxies out there, a billion perhaps out there like ours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. You have to be very arrogant and very presumptive to believe that this -- I'm a scientist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. I got my Ph.D. 66 years ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. You have to be very arrogant and presumptive to believe that this is the only place where life exists in a universe this large.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. So I'm really looking forward to the testimony today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. Thank you all very much for being here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
