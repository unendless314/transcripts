## Speaker Group 1

1. It's going to be an educational week, for sure.
→ {"text": "這肯定會是充滿學習的一週。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. And we are, as Chairman Bartlett said, we're going to be sitting like we are in committee, and we're going to pattern what we're doing today after a formal congressional hearing.
→ {"text": "如同巴特利特主席所言，我們將以委員會的形式就座，今天的活動將仿照正式的國會聽證會進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. And first of all, we have with us Congresswoman Darlene Hooley, and we have Senator Gravel, Mike Gravel.
→ {"text": "首先，我們有眾議員 Darlene Hooley，以及參議員 Mike Gravel。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. We have Congresswoman Carolyn Kilpatrick, and we have Congressman Merrill Cook.
→ {"text": "我們有眾議員 Carolyn Kilpatrick，以及眾議員 Merrill Cook。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

5. And we are all retired.
→ {"text": "我們都已退休。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. So among us, we have 80 years or more experience, but 80 years just on the federal level.
→ {"text": "我們幾位加起來擁有 80 年以上的經驗，僅聯邦層級就有 80 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. And Roscoe and I, we're classmates.
→ {"text": "Roscoe 和我是同學。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. We have 20 years each.
→ {"text": "我們各有 20 年經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. And I have to tell you, it is our commitment today, as if we were part of a hearing in the House of Representatives, it's our commitment to listen through objective ears and to ask the kinds of questions that we think that the American people would like us to ask so that they can become better informed, because obviously there's going to be a press on this.
→ {"text": "我必須告訴各位，今天我們的承諾，就如同我們參與眾議院聽證會一樣，我們承諾以客觀的態度聆聽，並提出我們認為美國人民希望我們提出的問題，讓他們能夠獲得更充分的資訊，因為顯然這將會有媒體報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. And we would like to make the public more aware, and we would like to have a hearing that could lead possibly to legislation or policymaking.
→ {"text": "我們希望提高公眾的認識，我們也希望這場聽證會能夠促成立法或政策制定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. So if we're objective, if we're businesslike, and we stick to the issue, I think we're going to have a very, very interesting week.
→ {"text": "因此，如果我們保持客觀、公事公辦，並且專注於議題本身，我認為我們將度過非常、非常有趣的一週。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. And right now, though, we get to swear in the first two witnesses.
→ {"text": "現在，我們要宣誓前兩位證人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. And initially, I think, Dr. Edgar Mitchell will be brought in on Skype.
→ {"text": "首先，我認為，艾德加·米切爾博士將透過 Skype 加入。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. Good morning, Dr. Mitchell.
→ {"text": "早安，米切爾博士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. Good morning.
→ {"text": "早安。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. I am a former astronaut, flew to the moon on Apollo 14.
→ {"text": "我是前太空人，曾搭乘阿波羅 14 號登月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. And so I have a little bit of out-of-the-earth experience, but also I grew up near Roswell, New Mexico on a ranch, and the so-called Roswell incident of 1947 occurred when I was a senior in high school and getting ready to go off to college in the East.
→ {"text": "因此我有一些離開地球的經驗，但我也在新墨西哥州 Roswell 附近的牧場長大，1947 年所謂的羅斯威爾事件發生時，我正就讀高中最後一年，準備前往東部上大學。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. So and I have been interested in this subject for many years, but let me set up the basic credentials-- for the first time in our human history, our technology is showing us how huge our universe-- well, let's just call it a multiverse-- is with billions and billions of galaxies and galactic clusters and stars, and many of them-- and we identified a few-- many of them so far that possibly could have living systems on them, living beings.
→ {"text": "我對這個主題感興趣已有多年，但讓我先建立基本背景——在人類歷史上第一次，我們的技術向我們展示了宇宙的浩瀚——不如就稱之為多重宇宙——擁有數十億個星系、星系團和恆星，其中許多——我們已經識別出一些——目前發現的許多星球可能擁有生命系統，存在生命存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. And we have a history that I'm aware of, particularly starting with the Roswell incident, but even long before that, that we have been visited by aliens or visitors from different star systems and different planets.
→ {"text": "據我所知，我們有一段歷史，特別是從羅斯威爾事件開始，但甚至在那之前很久，我們就一直被來自不同星系和不同星球的外星人或訪客造訪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. And of course, if we continue our endeavors, we will in due course be able to go outside our solar system as well.
→ {"text": "當然，如果我們持續努力，我們最終也能夠離開太陽系。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. At the moment, our technology is not allowing us to do that, but in due course, we will be able to do that, I'm quite sure, and we must because our sun will only last a few more billion years, and we're even doing things to it that cause it to be-- a life on this planet to be unsustainable, either way we're going by using non-renewable resources and so forth.
→ {"text": "目前我們的技術還不允許我們這樣做，但我相當確信，我們最終能夠做到，而且我們必須這樣做，因為我們的太陽只能再持續數十億年，而我們甚至正在做一些事情，導致——這個星球上的生命變得不可持續，無論如何，我們都在使用不可再生的資源等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. And so we have to rethink about this whole issue of our being here on this planet at this point in time, and how do we continue our life here, and how do we continue being stalwart citizens of planet Earth and keeping our civilization going and eventually be able to leave our planet and go somewhere else and investigate somewhere else, because we're not alone in the universe.
→ {"text": "因此，我們必須重新思考我們此時此刻存在於這個星球上的整個議題，我們如何在這裡延續生命，我們如何繼續成為地球堅定的公民，維持我們的文明，並最終能夠離開我們的星球，前往其他地方探索，因為我們在宇宙中並不孤單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. They have been coming here for a long, long time, it seems, the evidence would suggest that.
→ {"text": "看起來，他們來到這裡已經很長、很長時間了，證據顯示如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. We have been having visitors for a long, long time, perhaps hundreds, maybe even thousands of years.
→ {"text": "我們接受訪客造訪已經很長、很長時間了，也許數百年，甚至可能數千年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. There's some that would even say that the pyramid is both in Egypt and in South America, that the aliens aided us in building those, and that seems to have a reasonable ring to it.
→ {"text": "甚至有人會說，無論是埃及還是南美洲的金字塔，外星人都協助我們建造了那些建築，這似乎聽起來有一定道理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. But in any event, we're not alone in the universe, and we're only now beginning to get enough evidence through our science and our understanding of the way the universe is put together to recognize we really are alone, and that we can, in due course, just like others have, it appears.
→ {"text": "但無論如何，我們在宇宙中並不孤單，而且我們現在才剛開始透過科學以及對宇宙構成方式的理解，獲得足夠的證據來認識到我們並非真正孤單，而且我們最終也能做到，就像其他存有似乎已經做到的那樣。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文有「recognize we really are alone」疑似應為「not alone」，依上下文翻譯為「並非孤單」"}

27. They come here, we go there.
→ {"text": "他們來到這裡，我們前往那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. And so I think we'll have a lot of testimony here today regarding that fact, and I urge you to listen to it, and let's open this up to the larger picture that, and acknowledge, yes, we're not alone.
→ {"text": "因此，我認為今天我們將聽到許多關於這個事實的證詞，我敦促各位聆聽，讓我們打開視野看到更大的格局，並承認，是的，我們並不孤單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. We are, they are here.
→ {"text": "我們在這裡，他們也在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. We can't go there, and in due course, we will.
→ {"text": "我們目前還無法前往那裡，但最終我們會做到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. And for the last, I've been very interested in this for the last 16 or 17 years on a basis of speaking about it publicly, and since I went to the moon 47 years ago, and my co-colleague Gordon Cooper also had an incident when he was at Edwards Air Force Base as a duty officer at a UFO land while he was on duty.
→ {"text": "在過去 16 或 17 年裡，我一直對此非常感興趣，並公開談論這個話題，自從我 47 年前登月以來，我的同事 Gordon Cooper 在 Edwards 空軍基地擔任值勤官時，也曾在值勤期間目擊一架 UFO 降落。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. So there's a number of us that have had these types of experiences to say, yes, we're not alone.
→ {"text": "因此，我們當中有許多人曾有過這類經驗，可以說，是的，我們並不孤單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. We have been visited, and let's go forward in understanding this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "我們一直被訪問著，讓我們在理解這個現象方面繼續前進。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. And I hope you have a good week, and I'll stay, stay with you as long as I can.
→ {"text": "我希望各位有個美好的一週，我會盡可能與各位一起待在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "（掌聲）", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. Over many decades of service to the Canadian people, I have come to understand and appreciate the importance of open, transparent government and the power of truth as antidote to the many afflictions the body politic is heir to.
→ {"text": "在為加拿大人民服務的數十年間，我逐漸理解並重視開放、透明政府的重要性，以及真相作為解藥，能夠治癒政治體系所承受的諸多弊病。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. The true currency of the 21st century will not be gold or silver or a basket of currencies, however useful they may be.

→ {"text": "無論是對你的朋友、家人，還是對各國公民，我相信這場公民聽證會正是為了這個目的，而且就像我的朋友 Edgar Mitchell 一樣，我毫不含糊地說，我們在宇宙中並不孤單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
