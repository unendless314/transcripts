## Speaker Group 7

150. My name is Grant Cameron.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. I'm a private investigator.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. For the past 38 years, I have attempted to focus on what the highest levels of the U.S. government, military, and intelligence agencies know about the UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. I'm the director of the President's UFO website.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. As Steve Bassett mentioned, the Obama administration has come out with an official statement saying there is no ET evidence for an interaction with ET's and there is no cover-up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. What I would like to do, based on my years of research, is present a few pieces of evidence which show that this statement, written by a low-level White House staffer, is ill-informed and not true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. Mr. Dolan pointed out that President Truman had been briefed for five years orally on the subject of UFOs that does not appear in the official record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. I'd like to add that Truman, on video, does make a statement stating, "Yes, we discussed it at every conference we had with the military.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. There are always things like that going on, flying saucers and other such things."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. In 1969, the U.S. government officially shut down its official UFO investigation, stating that there was no evidence that UFOs were extraterrestrial and therefore they were out of the business.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. If this were true, the government would have shut up and allowed the subject to fade into history.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. This is not, however, what happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. Only three years after shutting down their program, the U.S. Air Force, at the direction of the Secretary of the Air Force, contacted two documentary film producers who signed an official film contract at the Pentagon to do a documentary on UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. They were provided with a number of films and pictures, including a film of extraterrestrials landing at Holloman Air Force Base, of which they used eight seconds in the final production.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. They were given another film, marked "Top Secret," that was never returned and is still in their possession.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. The documentary was funded with $250,000 and they were asked not to source the funder of the money in the credits.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. A CIA agent was present through the entire production, and as Linda Howe can testify, she saw a letter to one of the producers from President Richard Nixon thanking him for his cooperation on the project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. Former Senator Barry Goldwater wrote extensively on UFOs, such as in 1975 when he wrote about his friend General Curtis LeMay, who refused him access in 1964 to the Blue Room at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where alien hardware and bodies were rumored to have been held.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. Goldwater wrote, "I made an effort to find out what was in that building at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, and I was understandably denied this request.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. It is still classified above Top Secret."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Goldwater continued to answer UFO letters, stating in one letter, "This thing has gotten so highly classified, it is impossible to get anything on it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. In another letter, Goldwater wrote, "I have no idea who controls the flow of need to know because, frankly, I was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that I've never tried to make it my business since."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. And finally, Goldwater wrote, "I have been interested in this subject for a long time, and I know that whatever the Air Force has on this subject is going to remain highly classified."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. Those waiting for the president to stand up and say ETs are here should know that that event occurred on June the 27th, 1981.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. Steven Spielberg stated that after the screening of ET, the extraterrestrial, in the White House Theatre, Reagan "just stood up and looked around the room, almost like he was doing a head count.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. And he said, 'I want to thank you for bringing ET to the White House.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. We really enjoyed your movie.'
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. And then he looked around the room and he said, 'And there are a number of people in this room who know that everything on that screen is absolutely true.'"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. And Spielberg added, "And he said it without smiling."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. If you check the files of the Bush Library, you'll find nothing on UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. However, if you look at my files, you will find an audio of President Bush during the 1988 campaign being asked about UFOs, in which he says, "I know some.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. I know a fair bit."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. Likewise, I have a video of Vice President Dan Quayle stating, "The alien situation is very interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. We literally spent some time looking at this."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. In April 2001, I asked Vice President Dick Cheney if he had been ever briefed on the subject of UFOs while he was on the Diane Rehm Show here in Washington.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. Instead of Cheney stating that there were no credible ET evidence, Cheney replied, "If I had been briefed on that subject, it would probably be classified and I wouldn't be talking about it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. Even President Obama has said things that run contrary to the statement put out by his own White House.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. This might be because neither he nor anybody in his office saw the petition on ET question despite the fact that over 12,000 people signed the petition addressed to the President.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. During a visit to Roswell, New Mexico in 2012, President Obama referred to the White House -- to the Roswell crash saying, "We're going to keep our secrets here."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. This raises the question, in light of the statement put out by his office that there is no ET cover-up, what secrets is President Obama referring to?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. Then during a White House tour, President Obama anticipated a question that actor Will Smith's son Jayden wanted to ask about the reality of extraterrestrials.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. When they arrived in the White House situation room, the President said to Jayden, "I know what you want to ask.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. You want to know about the aliens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. I can neither conform nor deny that extraterrestrials have visited the Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. But if they had, and if there had been a top-secret meeting on the subject, it would have occurred in this very room."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. Then there is the story of Area 51, covered by 19-time Emmy Award-winning investigative reporter George Knapp, who has spent years covering the story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. Knapp stated that he has over two dozen witnesses who tell bits and pieces of a story of a captured live alien and extraterrestrial spacecraft that are being back-engineered on the Nevada test site.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. He has also revealed during interviews that he had a discussion with Senator Howard Cannon shortly before his death, and that Howard Cannon basically confirmed to him that he had talked to Goldwater and the stories were true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. Knapp stated that six of his witnesses were threatened, which succeeded in stopping them from going on camera.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. Finally, in July 2012, Chase Brandon, a 42-year veteran of the CIA, was a guest of the 2 million listeners of the overnight radio talk show called "Coast to Coast."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. His words on the ET cover-up were clear, as he referenced material he had seen at CIA headquarters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. To quote Chase Brandon, "I absolutely know, as I sit here talking to you, that there was a craft beyond this world that crashed at Roswell, and that the military picked up the remains of not just a wreckage, but of cadavers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. One hundred percent in my heart and soul," said Brandon, "Roswold happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. There was a craft and absolutely cadavers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. I don't know where the stuff is, but I know that Roswold happened."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
