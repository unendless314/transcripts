384. If I have done the time calculations correctly, we now have about five to six minutes for each of the six members of the committee to engage in questions with the panelists.
→ {"text": "如果我的時間計算正確，委員會六位成員每人將有大約五到六分鐘與證人進行問答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. As is my custom as a co-chair, I will reserve my questions till the end.
→ {"text": "按照我作為聯席主席的慣例，我會將我的問題保留到最後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. I've always done that in the Congress.
→ {"text": "我在國會一直是這樣做的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. If my questions have been asked by my colleagues, I will simply thank the witnesses.
→ {"text": "如果我的問題已經被同事問過了，我就只會感謝證人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. So Mr. Dolan, I have a question, I wrote it, personal experience, have you had personal experience in this regard?
→ {"text": "那麼多蘭先生，我有一個問題，我寫下來了，個人經驗，您在這方面有過個人經驗嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. I don't really know if any personal experience I've had is particularly noteworthy.
→ {"text": "我不太確定我所經歷的任何個人經驗是否特別值得一提。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. On two occasions in my life, I saw what I think might be vaguely considered a UFO.
→ {"text": "在我人生中有兩次，我看到了我認為可以勉強算是不明飛行物的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. Most interesting, many years ago with my son who was a small boy, I was holding his hand in a bright blue, perfectly blue sky, I saw an object that was quite unusual, brighter than anything I'd ever seen in the sky other than the sun and he was very small.
→ {"text": "最有趣的是，許多年前我和當時還是小男孩的兒子在一起，我牽著他的手，在明亮湛藍、完美無瑕的天空中，我看到了一個相當不尋常的物體，比我在天空中見過的任何東西都要明亮，除了太陽之外，而他當時非常小。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. He watched me staring at this thing, silent and wondering what happened to dad?
→ {"text": "他看著我盯著那個東西，沉默不語，心想爸爸怎麼了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. And I turned to reassure him for one moment and I looked back literally one second later and the thing was gone.
→ {"text": "我轉身安撫他一下，然後確實就在一秒鐘後回頭看，那東西已經消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. I have no idea what it was, that's really never been my motivation for studying this.
→ {"text": "我不知道那是什麼，這確實從來不是我研究這個主題的動機。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. I fell into this topic about 20 years ago while doing dissertation work on US national security circa 1950 and just stumbled into the topic of UFOs and I guess you could call it an obsession ever since.
→ {"text": "大約 20 年前，我在撰寫關於 1950 年前後美國國家安全的論文時接觸到這個主題，無意中踏入了不明飛行物的領域，從那時起我想你可以說這成了一種執念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. So why do you think, I mean I know it's opinion so we get this, why the steadfast silence and denial, what's the risk?
→ {"text": "那麼您認為，我是說我知道這是意見所以我們理解，為什麼要堅持沉默和否認，風險是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. I think the implications are vastly, very profound.
→ {"text": "我認為其影響極其深遠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. If we try to rewind the clock 60 plus years back to the 1940s and just imagine, just pretend for the moment that it actually happened because many of us I think it did, that an event say at Roswell happened or maybe elsewhere or other types of grave violations of airspace were going on.
→ {"text": "如果我們試著將時鐘倒轉 60 多年回到 1940 年代，然後想像一下，暫且假設這確實發生了，因為我們許多人認為它確實發生了，比如羅斯威爾事件發生了，或者在其他地方，或者其他類型的嚴重領空侵犯正在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. If we think back to the very post World War II era, the world was in a state of flat on its back trying to get back, there were millions of homeless people around the world, people on the brink of starvation in the early Cold War.
→ {"text": "如果我們回想二戰結束後的時代，世界處於一片狼藉、正試圖復甦的狀態，全球有數百萬無家可歸的人，在冷戰初期還有人處於飢餓邊緣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. It was not a stable time and one would have to assume the last thing any president would be interested in doing would be to say to the world, well we have this other phenomenon here too.
→ {"text": "那不是一個穩定的時期，人們必須假設任何總統最不願意做的事情就是向全世界說，好吧，我們這裡還有另一個現象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. We don't know who these people are, we don't really know if they're friendly or hostile.
→ {"text": "我們不知道這些人是誰，我們真的不知道他們是友善還是敵對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. How can you tell the world that you have this under control when you yourself don't really know the full implications of what this is?
→ {"text": "當你自己都不真正了解這件事的全部含義時，你怎麼能告訴全世界你已經控制了局面？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. So I think the logical thing that would have been done and in particular if anything was recovered because this is key.
→ {"text": "所以我認為當時會採取的合理做法，特別是如果回收了任何東西，因為這是關鍵。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. If one of your top scientists or generals approaches you and says sir we've recovered this exotic technology that's not from our civilization and if you tell the world you have it, now you've got the specter of the Soviet Union, it becomes very difficult not to share this technology.
→ {"text": "如果你的頂尖科學家或將軍之一找你說，長官，我們回收了這項並非來自我們文明的異常技術，如果你告訴全世界你擁有它，現在你面臨蘇聯的威脅，就很難不分享這項技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. The United States did not want to share atomic technology in 1947.
→ {"text": "美國在 1947 年不想分享原子技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. Clearly why would they want to share something as exotic as ET technology or whatever.
→ {"text": "顯然他們為什麼要分享像外星技術這樣異常的東西或其他什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. Well okay, but this is the 21st century now.
→ {"text": "好吧，但這已經是 21 世紀了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. Right, so what I think what happened is simply that secrecy becomes secret, it becomes profitable.
→ {"text": "沒錯，所以我認為發生的事情很簡單，保密本身成為秘密，它變得有利可圖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. It develops its own reason to be.
→ {"text": "它發展出自己存在的理由。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. It develops its own kind of logic and I also think that much of it has sort of gone away from formal government channels and seems to become increasingly privatized.
→ {"text": "它發展出自己的邏輯，我也認為其中很大一部分已經脫離了正式的政府管道，似乎變得越來越私有化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. So do I have time, any more time?
→ {"text": "那麼我還有時間嗎，還有時間嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

She was in on these meetings and she had agreed to go on camera with George Knapp after the story started to break in 1989, she was visited by two officers the same day she was going to go on camera and they said we just want to remind you, you have a security clearance, you're still under oath.
→ {"text": "她參加了這些會議，在 1989 年故事開始曝光後，她同意與 George Knapp 一起上鏡頭，就在她要上鏡頭的當天，兩名軍官拜訪了她，他們說我們只是想提醒你，你有安全許可，你仍然受誓言約束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

504. I want to associate my thoughts with Chairman Bartlett when he made the statement that it's the height of human arrogance to think that we are the only sentient human beings in the galaxies of the world that can think, that's human arrogance at its worst.
→ {"text": "我想回應巴特利特主席的發言，他說認為我們是世界星系中唯一能夠思考的有知覺人類，這是人類傲慢的極致，那是最糟糕的人類傲慢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

505. What I'm struck with, with the testimony of all four of you and of course the readings that we had with preparing for this hearing, is the fact of secrecy itself, you know, why do we need this secrecy?
→ {"text": "讓我印象深刻的是，聽了你們四位的證詞，當然還有我們為這次聽證會準備的閱讀資料，就是保密這件事本身，你知道，我們為什麼需要這種保密？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 47

508. I started to say before, I can see six reasons for our government and other governments to keep things classified.
→ {"text": "我之前開始說過，我能看到我們政府和其他政府保持事物機密的六個理由。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. First you want to figure out how they work, they make wonderful weapons delivery and defense systems and with the Cold War going on, if you do have wreckage and you want to figure out something, you're not going to want to tell your enemies.
→ {"text": "首先你想弄清楚它們是如何運作的，它們是很棒的武器運載和防禦系統，而在冷戰期間，如果你確實有殘骸並且想弄清楚些什麼，你不會想告訴你的敵人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

510. The second problem is what if they figure out how they work before you do?
→ {"text": "第二個問題是，如果他們在你之前弄清楚了它們是如何運作的怎麼辦？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. You don't want them to know, you know, they know, weapon, counter weapon, counter, counter weapon, we've been playing this game a long time.
→ {"text": "你不想讓他們知道，你知道，他們知道，武器、反制武器、反制、反制武器，我們已經玩這個遊戲很長時間了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

512. The third problem is if there were an announcement, I say by highly trusted individuals it's a little hard to find them around the planet, but my favorite odd couple is the Pope and the Queen.
→ {"text": "第三個問題是如果有一個公告，我說由高度受信任的人發布，在這個星球上有點難找到他們，但我最喜歡的奇怪組合是教宗和女王。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

513. They're about the same age or they were until recently anyway.
→ {"text": "他們年齡差不多，或者無論如何直到最近都是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

514. If they were to make an announcement that indeed UFOs are visiting, the planet's being visited, what would happen?
→ {"text": "如果他們宣布確實有 UFO 正在訪問，地球正在被訪問，會發生什麼事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. Church attendance would go up, mental hospital admissions would go up, the stock market would go down, but I think based on 600 college lectures at the younger generation, which unlike me and probably you wasn't alive when there wasn't a space program.
→ {"text": "教堂出席率會上升，精神病院入院人數會上升，股市會下跌，但我認為基於對年輕一代的 600 場大學演講，與我和可能你不同，他們在沒有太空計畫的時候還沒出生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. There was strong sentiment against space travel back not too many years ago.
→ {"text": "在不久之前，對太空旅行還有強烈的反對情緒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

517. The younger generation would push for an earthling orientation.
→ {"text": "年輕一代會推動地球人取向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

518. Let's face it from an alien viewpoint, we are all earthlings, Terrans as the science fiction writers would say.
→ {"text": "讓我們面對現實，從外星人的觀點來看，我們都是地球人，就像科幻作家所說的 Terrans。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

520. As far as I can tell, nationalism is the only game in town.
→ {"text": "據我所知，民族主義是唯一的選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

521. There are some religious problems, extremists who say we're the only intelligent life in the universe and their followers don't want any part of visitors from outer space.
→ {"text": "有一些宗教問題，極端主義者說我們是宇宙中唯一的智慧生命，他們的追隨者不想要任何來自外太空訪客的部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

522. He can't be.

→ {"text": "行星是在公元前 4004 年創造的，而不是 40 億年前。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Transcription appears garbled at end"}

524. A final thing, I have 7 times heard of cases in which pilots were scrambled to chase UFOs.
→ {"text": "最後一件事，我聽說過 7 次飛行員緊急起飛追趕 UFO 的案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

525. There was a regulation issue, shoot them down if they don't land when instructed to do so when 7 pilots didn't come back.
→ {"text": "有一個規定問題，如果他們在被指示降落時不降落就將其擊落，當時有 7 名飛行員沒有回來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

526. These were quiet discussions, these were not big public things.
→ {"text": "這些是私下討論，不是大型公開事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

527. And if I've heard 7, there are a lot more cases like that.
→ {"text": "如果我聽說過 7 次，那麼還有更多類似的案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

528. There were 200 fatal military plane crashes between 1951 and '56, including 5 where the pilots had over 100 missions in Korea where there were MiGs trying to shoot them down.
→ {"text": "1951 年至 1956 年間有 200 起致命的軍機墜毀事故，其中 5 起涉及在韓國執行過 100 多次任務的飛行員，當時有米格機試圖擊落他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

529. That's a pretty good pilot to survive that.
→ {"text": "能在那種情況下生存下來的是相當優秀的飛行員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

530. Comes back to the United States, no MiGs and his plane, as the New York Times said, disintegrated or disappeared, two strange terms to use in this context.
→ {"text": "回到美國，沒有米格機，他的飛機，如《紐約時報》所說，解體或消失了，這兩個在此情境下使用的奇怪術語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

531. So no families were told anything about that.
→ {"text": "所以沒有任何家屬被告知這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

532. And it won't come as a shock to you, but there were 166 Air Force guys on board reconnaissance planes that were tickling North Korea, Russia, and China right after the war.
→ {"text": "這對你來說不會感到震驚，但戰後有 166 名空軍人員在偵察機上挑釁北韓、俄羅斯和中國。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

533. See how quickly the radar came on, what frequency they used and all that sort of stuff. 166 wind up in planes that were shot down.
→ {"text": "看看雷達多快開啟、他們使用什麼頻率以及所有類似的事情。166 人最終在被擊落的飛機上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

534. Not one word in public about that.
→ {"text": "對此沒有公開過一個字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

535. Families were not told until 2001 where a meeting was called and the medals were given out and an explanation was given.
→ {"text": "家屬直到 2001 年才被告知，當時召開了一次會議，頒發了勳章並給出了解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

536. I say that only because a lot of people think, well, certainly they would have told the families those 7 planes.
→ {"text": "我之所以這麼說，只是因為很多人認為，好吧，他們肯定會告訴那 7 架飛機的家屬。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

537. So that's an area of concern, I think, to admit that we can't do anything about these guys.
→ {"text": "所以我認為，承認我們對這些傢伙無能為力是一個令人擔憂的領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

538. But powerlessness is not something that attracts people to government.
→ {"text": "但無力感不是吸引人們投身政府的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 48

539. May I add a very quick follow-up in not taking a lot of time?
→ {"text": "我可以快速補充一下而不佔用太多時間嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

540. I talked earlier about why I think that the possession of certain radical technology would have initiated some of the secrecy.
→ {"text": "我之前談到為什麼我認為擁有某些激進技術會啟動一些保密措施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

541. Also, I think the need to maintain some level of social control, not knowing what these other beings were, at least in the early years.
→ {"text": "此外，我認為需要維持某種程度的社會控制，至少在早期不知道這些其他生物是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

542. But I think what happens is once a secret goes on for long enough, it becomes a real nightmare to kind of contain.
→ {"text": "但我認為發生的情況是，一旦秘密持續夠久，它就會變成一場真正的噩夢，難以遏制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

543. I can only imagine the difficulty that President Obama would face if he were somehow to make this announcement.
→ {"text": "我只能想像如果歐巴馬總統以某種方式宣布這件事，他將面臨的困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

544. I mean, really.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

545. If he were to -- if something were to force him to make an admission that, yes, these UFOs, apparently at least some of them are real, what does he then say at this press conference?
→ {"text": "如果他要——如果有什麼迫使他承認，是的，這些 UFO，顯然至少其中一些是真的，那麼他在記者會上要說什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

546. I know what he'd like to say, which is, well, thanks everyone, I'm going on a vacation for about six months.
→ {"text": "我知道他想說什麼，那就是，好吧，謝謝大家，我要去度假大約六個月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

547. Because there are a lot of follow-up questions that would be, frankly, very uncomfortable for him to deal with.
→ {"text": "因為會有很多後續問題，坦白說，對他來說處理起來會非常不舒服。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

548. I think one of the questions that most responsible journalists would want to ask is how on earth were you guys able to keep this secret for over 60 years?
→ {"text": "我認為大多數負責任的記者會想問的問題之一是，你們究竟是如何能夠將這個秘密保持超過 60 年的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

549. How did you do it?
→ {"text": "你們是怎麼做到的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

550. And the implications for getting into that whole issue are a nightmare.
→ {"text": "而深入探討整個問題的影響是一場噩夢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

551. Was it you starting to deal with, has there been some level of control over the mainstream major media academic community?
→ {"text": "你們開始要處理的是，是否對主流大型媒體學術界有某種程度的控制？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Sentence structure is somewhat unclear in source"}

552. In fact, there are many off-the-shelf academic studies that show intelligence community influence over our major journalism and over our major academic communities.
→ {"text": "事實上，有許多現成的學術研究顯示情報界對我們主要新聞業和主要學術界的影響。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

553. It's not a big secret.
→ {"text": "這不是什麼大秘密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

554. It's a longstanding relationship.
→ {"text": "這是一種長期存在的關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

555. But there would be some very deep questions to ask about that, about the nature of special access programs and unacknowledged special access programs and the primordial black budget.
→ {"text": "但關於這一點會有一些非常深刻的問題要問，關於特殊准入計畫的性質、未公開的特殊准入計畫以及原始的黑預算。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

556. All of these would now become the target of citizen inquiry.
→ {"text": "所有這些現在都會成為公民調查的目標。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

557. And I believe firmly that an admission on this topic, in addition to all of the scientific and existential issues that it raises, also gets into just some nasty concrete political issues that I don't think any presidential administration would want to have to deal with.
→ {"text": "我堅信，除了這個話題所引發的所有科學和存在性問題之外，承認這件事還會涉及一些棘手的具體政治問題，我認為任何總統政府都不會想要處理這些問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

558. And I could add to that, from leaked sources, military and intel that I have encountered in my career, there is a complexity that as you go deeper beyond lights in the sky craft, a government interest in back engineering technology.
→ {"text": "我可以補充一點，從我職業生涯中遇到的洩露來源、軍方和情報界來看，當你深入探究超越天空中光點和飛行器之外的事物時，存在一種複雜性，即政府對逆向工程技術的興趣。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Complex sentence structure"}

559. There is testimony from, for example, someone who had worked at Wright-Patterson in the medical department who has told me, and this is a historic fact as far as I know, that one of the first autopsies that were done from one of the crashes in Roswell in 1947, and that was not the beginning.
→ {"text": "例如，有一位曾在萊特-帕特森空軍基地醫療部門工作的人的證詞告訴我，據我所知這是歷史事實，1947 年羅斯威爾事件墜毀案中進行的第一批解剖之一，而那還不是開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

560. We had been retrieving craft and bodies from at least 1941 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.
→ {"text": "我們至少從 1941 年起就在密蘇里州開普吉拉多回收飛行器和遺體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

561. But in terms of Roswell, one of the bodies, when the surgeon took a scalpel to start a T or a Y section on the autopsy, the report was this is not tissue.
→ {"text": "但就羅斯威爾而言，其中一具遺體，當外科醫生拿起手術刀開始在解剖時做 T 型或 Y 型切口時，報告說這不是組織。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

562. It was fabric.
→ {"text": "那是織物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

563. And that in 1947, our government was discovering that they weren't probably dealing with the prime intelligence that was behind the craft, that they were dealing with something that would fall into the area of androidism.
→ {"text": "而在 1947 年，我們的政府發現他們可能並不是在與飛行器背後的主要智慧打交道，他們面對的是屬於類人機器人領域的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

564. Today we have drones that are overflying the world.
→ {"text": "今天我們有無人機在世界各地飛行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

565. Back in 1947, our government came to understand that some of the bodies that they were taking from these craft were not even biological tissue as we understand it.
→ {"text": "早在 1947 年，我們的政府就開始理解，他們從這些飛行器中取出的一些遺體甚至不是我們所理解的生物組織。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

566. And then you combine that with a sentence that I read in the alleged briefing paper that I was shown at Kirtland Air Force Base in the OSI office, the quote which has never left my mind.
→ {"text": "然後你將這一點與我在柯特蘭空軍基地 OSI 辦公室看到的那份所謂簡報文件中讀到的一句話結合起來，那句引文從未離開過我的腦海。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Transcription error corrected: Curlin → Kirtland"}

567. These extraterrestrial biological entities manipulated DNA and already evolving primates to create Homo sapien, close quote.
→ {"text": "「這些外星生物實體操縱了 DNA 和已經在進化的靈長類動物，以創造現代智人」，引文結束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

568. Then that suggests that the relationship between what is in the skies, on the ground, underground and interacting with humans and animals and plant life on this planet, as one man working for the DIA in retirement told me, Linda, we are convinced that the intelligence interacting with this planet has been here for more than 270 million years predating the dinosaurs.
→ {"text": "那麼這表明，天空中、地面上、地下以及與這個星球上的人類、動物和植物生命互動的事物之間的關係，正如一位為 DIA 工作的退休人員告訴我的，琳達，我們確信與這個星球互動的智慧已經在這裡超過 2 億 7 千萬年，早於恐龍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

569. If the size and the scope of this is that large, and if our government began to stumble on to these facts piece by piece in World War II and after, then I can understand why President Truman and Churchill and Eisenhower and that group of people would have said let's wait two generations until we find out what we're dealing with.
→ {"text": "如果規模和範圍如此之大，如果我們的政府在二戰期間和之後開始一點一點地偶然發現這些事實，那麼我可以理解為什麼杜魯門總統、邱吉爾、艾森豪和那群人會說讓我們等待兩代人，直到我們弄清楚我們正在處理什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. And what makes me nervous and what bothers me is why in 2013 is the policy of denial not only in effect, but the people that I am talking to on the phone have visits by somebody from the government saying you are not to talk to Linda Moulton Howe ever again.
→ {"text": "讓我緊張和困擾的是，為什麼在 2013 年，否認政策不僅仍在實施，而且我在電話中交談的人會被政府的某人拜訪，說你不能再與琳達·莫爾頓·豪交談了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

571. Something is very wrong in the underbelly of this country that I think is related directly to a policy of denial from World War II about the fact that extraterrestrial biological entities, to use our government's own phrase in its own alleged documents, are interacting with this planet have been for centuries and that there is an intimate relationship between what we are and what they made and that might explain why there is no wholesale evidence anywhere that the non-humans want to kill humans.
→ {"text": "這個國家的陰暗面有些非常不對勁，我認為這直接關係到二戰以來的否認政策，關於外星生物實體這一事實，用我們政府在其所謂文件中的說法，幾個世紀以來一直在與這個星球互動，我們是什麼與他們創造了什麼之間存在密切關係，這可能解釋了為什麼沒有任何大規模證據顯示非人類想要殺死人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

572. They want, it appears from my point of view as an investigative reporter talking with so many people, that there is an ongoing research program about what is happening on this planet in the surface life on earth.
→ {"text": "從我作為調查記者與這麼多人交談的角度來看，他們似乎想要的是，有一個正在進行的研究計畫，關於這個星球上、地球表面生命中正在發生的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

573. We are now running about 10 minutes late.
→ {"text": "我們現在已經遲了大約 10 分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

574. Pardon me.

575. Yes, I understand that time is slipping away.
→ {"text": "是的，我理解時間正在流逝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

576. Several of my questions have been asked.
→ {"text": "我的幾個問題已經被問過了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

577. I hope that that is true for the next two witnesses so that their question period may be shorter.
→ {"text": "我希望接下來的兩位證人也是如此，這樣他們的問答時間可能會更短。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

578. Congressman Cook.

579. I would like to claim my five minutes, Chairman, if that is all right.
→ {"text": "主席，如果可以的話，我想要求我的五分鐘時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. I would like to ask Grant Cameron, maybe the first question, and if the others have a comment, be very happy to take those two and Mr. Cameron, take a minute, but the others maybe ten seconds if they have something to add.
→ {"text": "我想問格蘭特·卡麥隆，也許是第一個問題，如果其他人有評論，我會很樂意聽取這兩者，卡麥隆先生，請用一分鐘，但如果其他人有要補充的，也許十秒鐘。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Complex sentence structure"}

581. I think you are the one that talked about five years of hearings for President Truman.
→ {"text": "我想您是談到杜魯門總統五年聽證會的那位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

582. Briefings, yes.
→ {"text": "簡報，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. And many, well, I know that Mr. Dolan also mentioned this.
→ {"text": "而且很多，嗯，我知道多蘭先生也提到了這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

584. I guess 16 different, did you say 16 different?
→ {"text": "我猜是 16 次不同的，您說是 16 次不同的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

585. We figure between 16 and 20 briefings.
→ {"text": "我們估計是 16 到 20 次簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

586. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

587. Is it possible the Truman administration was concerned at the time more about either the Soviet Union, which you did mention, I think, Mr. Dolan, or Nazi Germany as a source of some of the unidentified flying maneuvers they were watching and reporting on and being very concerned about?
→ {"text": "杜魯門政府當時是否更擔心蘇聯，我想多蘭先生您確實提到過，或者納粹德國是他們正在觀察和報告並非常關注的一些不明飛行機動行為的來源？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. I think it is basically the minute they looked at the Roswell crash, if that was the first crash, they saw technology.
→ {"text": "我認為基本上當他們看到羅斯威爾墜毀事件時，如果那是第一次墜毀，他們就看到了技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

589. It's classified.

590. End of game.

591. This is, you're not giving this to the Soviets, you're not giving it to the Chinese.

592. This is our type of technology.
→ {"text": "這是我們的技術類型。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

593. On Thursday, I'll refer to a Canadian government document, 1950, where the Canadians went to the United States, talked to American officials, and one of the things that they were told is that mental phenomena was involved with the saucers.
→ {"text": "在星期四，我會提到一份加拿大政府文件，1950 年，加拿大人前往美國，與美國官員交談，他們被告知的其中一件事是心理現象與飛碟有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

594. So there's a lot of technology here, and you just have to think, are you going to give the technology that you may hear this week at this session, are you going to give it to Al-Qaeda, are you going to give it to the Chinese?
→ {"text": "所以這裡有很多技術，你只需要想想，你會把本週在這次會議上可能聽到的技術給誰，你會給基地組織嗎，你會給中國人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

595. To me, it was simple that Truman and the people around Truman saw technology.

596. We need this.

601. Let me just add, sir, to answer your question relating to the Soviets and Nazis and so forth.

602. In the early era of this, these types of questions were being asked.

603. They absolutely were.

604. The question is, because you have different levels of security, and the declassified documents that we have, really the top secret and above, we have very few of those.
→ {"text": "問題是，因為有不同等級的保密，我們擁有的解密文件，真正的最高機密及以上等級，我們擁有的非常少。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

605. So the declassified documents that are available to citizens are of the level of secret and confidential and restricted.
