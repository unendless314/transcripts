206. Thank you for inviting me here.
→ {"text": "感謝邀請我來到這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. As a retired nuclear physicist who has been studying the evidence about UFOs since 1958 and since 1967 has given well over 700 lectures in all 50 states, 10 Canadian provinces and 18 other countries, I've reached four major conclusions.
→ {"text": "作為一位退休的核子物理學家，自 1958 年以來一直在研究有關不明飛行物 (UFO) 的證據，並且自 1967 年以來已在全美 50 個州、加拿大 10 個省份以及其他 18 個國家進行了超過 700 場演講，我得出了四個主要結論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. One, the evidence is overwhelming that Earth is being visited by intelligently controlled extraterrestrial spacecraft.
→ {"text": "第一，有壓倒性的證據顯示，地球正被具有智慧控制的外星太空船造訪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. In other words, some, underlined 10 times, some UFOs are alien spacecraft.
→ {"text": "換句話說，某些——強調 10 次——某些不明飛行物是外星太空船。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. Most are not.
→ {"text": "大多數都不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. Don't care about them.
→ {"text": "不在乎那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. Two, there is no doubt that a small number of people within governments, both in the United States and overseas, have been actively covering up the truth about these visits.
→ {"text": "第二，毫無疑問，無論在美國還是海外，各國政府內部都有少數人一直在積極掩蓋這些造訪的真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. There really is a cosmic water gate.
→ {"text": "確實存在著一個宇宙水門案 (cosmic water gate)。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. Three, there are no good arguments against these conclusions, only people who haven't studied the relevant evidence.
→ {"text": "第三，沒有任何有力的論據可以反駁這些結論，只有那些尚未研究過相關證據的人才會質疑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. And four, flying saucer visitations and the cosmic water gate represent the biggest story of the millennium.
→ {"text": "第四，飛碟造訪與宇宙水門案代表著千禧年來最重大的新聞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. And I should say that I prefer the term flying saucer because all flying saucers are UFOs.
→ {"text": "我應該說，我更喜歡使用「飛碟」這個詞，因為所有飛碟都是不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. Very few UFOs are flying saucers.
→ {"text": "極少數的不明飛行物是飛碟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. All great-grandfathers are men, not all men are great-grandfathers.
→ {"text": "所有曾祖父都是男人，但並非所有男人都是曾祖父。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. I'm interested in the flying saucers, not the UFOs.
→ {"text": "我感興趣的是飛碟，而不是不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. The basis for these conclusions, A, there are at least five large-scale scientific studies which provide substantial evidence.
→ {"text": "這些結論的依據是，第一，至少有五項大規模科學研究提供了實質證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. These include Project Blue Book Special Report Number 14, the largest study ever done for the United States Air Force, covering more than 3,200 cases with more than 200 charts, tables, graphs, and maps.
→ {"text": "其中包括藍皮書計畫特別報告14號 (Project Blue Book Special Report Number 14)，這是為美國空軍進行的最大規模研究，涵蓋超過 3,200 個案例，包含超過 200 個圖表、表格、圖形與地圖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. It is quality evaluation, cross-comparison between unknowns and knowns.
→ {"text": "這是一個質量評估，對未知案例與已知案例進行交叉比較。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. The official press release lied about the data, I'll document that in a minute, is almost never referenced by UFO debunkers.
→ {"text": "官方新聞稿對數據撒了謊——我稍後會證明這點——而 UFO 揭穿者幾乎從不引用這份報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. Dr. Carl Sagan, we were classmates at the University of Chicago, claimed there are interesting UFO sightings that are not reliable, and reliable UFO sightings that are not interesting.
→ {"text": "卡爾·薩根博士 (Dr. Carl Sagan)——我們是芝加哥大學的同學——聲稱有些有趣的 UFO 目擊事件並不可靠，而可靠的 UFO 目擊事件又不有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. But there are no cases that are both reliable and interesting.
→ {"text": "但沒有任何案例同時具備可靠性和趣味性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. This statement was not backed up by reference to data, but is directly contradicted by the Blue Book Special Report 14 data.
→ {"text": "這個說法並沒有數據支持，反而與藍皮書特別報告14號的數據直接矛盾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. It was found that the more reliable the case, the more likely to be unexplainable.
→ {"text": "研究發現，案例越可靠，就越可能無法解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. United States Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles, in the very widely distributed press release when the 1955 study was completed, flat out lied, it's a strong statement and I'm sorry to make it, but it's true.
→ {"text": "美國空軍部長唐納德·夸爾斯 (Donald Quarles) 在 1955 年研究完成時發布的廣為流傳的新聞稿中公然撒謊——這是一個強烈的指控，我很抱歉要這麼說，但這是事實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. He stated, "We believe that no objects such as those properly described as flying saucers have overflown the United States.
→ {"text": "他聲稱：「我們相信，沒有任何可以被正確描述為飛碟的物體飛越過美國。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. Even the unknown 3% could have been identified as conventional phenomena or illusions if more complete observational data had been available."
→ {"text": "即使是那未知的 3%，如果有更完整的觀測數據，也可以被識別為傳統現象或錯覺。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. The fact of the matter in the report that he was talking about is that the unknowns comprise 21.5% of the cases completely separate from the 9.3% listed as insufficient information.
→ {"text": "事實上，他所談論的報告中，未知案例佔了 21.5%，完全獨立於被列為資訊不足的 9.3%。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. The 3% number was a lie.
→ {"text": "3% 這個數字是謊言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. Furthermore, a statistical comparison of the unknowns and knowns showed that the probability that the unknowns were just misknowns was less than 1%.
→ {"text": "此外，對未知案例與已知案例的統計比較顯示，未知案例只是誤認已知現象的機率低於 1%。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. It must further be noted that the press release did not give the title of the report or the company that did the work, Battelle Memorial Institute.
→ {"text": "還必須注意的是，新聞稿並未給出報告的標題，也沒有提到執行這項工作的公司——巴特爾紀念研究所 (Battelle Memorial Institute)。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. If they'd given the title, surely some newsman would have said, "Hey, what happened to reports one through 13?"
→ {"text": "如果他們公布了報告標題，肯定會有記者問：「嘿，第 1 到第 13 號報告呢？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. They'd never heard about them.
→ {"text": "他們從未聽說過那些報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. The correct answer, had it been given, would have been that they were all classified.
→ {"text": "正確答案——如果他們給出的話——應該是那些報告全都被列為機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. It's a very valuable source of information, this report.
→ {"text": "這份報告是非常寶貴的資訊來源。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. It's funny how the debunkers never talk about it.
→ {"text": "有趣的是，揭穿者從不談論這份報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. Another primary source of valuable data, which should be of interest to you all, are the congressional hearings of July 29, 1968, which included testimony from 12 scientists.
→ {"text": "另一個你們都應該感興趣的寶貴數據主要來源，是 1968 年 7 月 29 日的國會聽證會，其中包括 12 位科學家的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. The most important paper was by Dr. James E. McDonald, professor of physics at the University of Arizona.
→ {"text": "最重要的論文是由亞利桑那大學物理學教授詹姆斯·E·麥克唐納博士 (Dr. James E. McDonald) 提交的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. He had talked to 500 witnesses, but he presented 41 outstanding cases, including multiple witness radar visual sightings, sightings by pilots, by astronomers, by meteorologists.
→ {"text": "他訪談了 500 名目擊者，但他呈現了 41 個傑出案例，包括多名目擊者的雷達視覺目擊、飛行員目擊、天文學家目擊、以及氣象學家目擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. He noted physical trace cases of which, by now, more than 5,000 have been collected by Ted Phillips from 95 countries.
→ {"text": "他注意到了物理痕跡案例，至今 Ted Phillips 已從 95 個國家收集了超過 5,000 個此類案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. They get dull, same thing was happening all over the world.
→ {"text": "這些案例變得單調，因為同樣的事情在全世界各地都在發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. Saucer is seen on the ground, it leaves, they find physical changes, happens here, it happens there, it happens everywhere.
→ {"text": "飛碟被目擊降落在地面，它離開後，他們發現物理變化——這裡發生、那裡發生、到處都發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. One-sixth of those cases involved reports of small beings associated with the craft while it was on the ground.
→ {"text": "這些案例中有六分之一涉及在飛行器停在地面時，與之相關的小型生物的報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. I was the youngest contributor to those, and I think the only survivor since then, to those hearings in 1968.
→ {"text": "我是 1968 年那些聽證會中最年輕的貢獻者，我想我也是至今唯一的倖存者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. And I was the only one without a PhD, that might tell you something, I'm not sure what.
→ {"text": "而且我是唯一一個沒有博士學位的人——這可能說明了什麼，我不確定是什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. The proceedings, incidentally, are still available online.
→ {"text": "順帶一提，這些聽證會記錄至今仍可在線上取得。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. One of the contributors was Dr. J. Allen Hynek, chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern University, and for 20 years, United States Air Force scientific consultant to Project Blue Book.
→ {"text": "其中一位貢獻者是 Dr. J. Allen Hynek，他是西北大學天文學系主任，並且擔任美國空軍藍皮書計畫 (Project Blue Book) 的科學顧問長達 20 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. His book, The UFO Experience, a Scientific Inquiry, should be required reading by anybody who's going to talk about flying saucers, especially negatively.
→ {"text": "他的書《The UFO Experience, a Scientific Inquiry》應該是任何要談論飛碟的人——特別是持負面態度的人——的必讀讀物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. According to another source here, according to a special UFO subcommittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, world's largest group of space scientists, 30% of the 117 cases studied by the University of Colorado, government-sponsored study in the late '60s, and discussed in the Condon Report, Edward U. Condon, could not be identified, and yet the headline said, "Scientific study shows no UFOs."
→ {"text": "根據另一個資料來源，根據美國航空航天學會——世界最大的太空科學家團體——的 UFO 特別小組委員會，科羅拉多大學在 60 年代後期進行的政府資助研究中所研究的 117 個案例中，有 30% 無法被識別，而這些案例在 Edward U. Condon 的康登報告 (Condon Report) 中有討論，但頭條卻寫著「科學研究顯示沒有 UFO」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. Totally untrue.

267. He somehow manages to mention none of the five large-scale scientific studies that I've just talked about, or any of the 5,000 physical trace cases, or any multiple witness radar visual cases, or abductions nor advanced technology studies at national labs and an industry showing trips to nearby stars in reasonable round-trip times using fusion propulsion are feasible.
→ {"text": "他竟然完全沒有提及我剛才談到的五項大規模科學研究，也沒有提到任何 5,000 個物理痕跡案例，或任何多名目擊者的雷達視覺案例，或綁架案，也沒有提到國家實驗室與產業界進行的先進技術研究——這些研究顯示使用核融合推進在合理的往返時間內前往鄰近恆星是可行的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
