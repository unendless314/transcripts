## Speaker Group 7

206. Thank you for inviting me here.

207. As a retired nuclear physicist who has been studying the evidence about UFOs since 1958 and since 1967 has given well over 700 lectures in all 50 states, 10 Canadian provinces and 18 other countries, I've reached four major conclusions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. One, the evidence is overwhelming that Earth is being visited by intelligently controlled extraterrestrial spacecraft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. In other words, some, underlined 10 times, some UFOs are alien spacecraft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. Most are not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. Don't care about them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. Two, there is no doubt that a small number of people within governments, both in the United States and overseas, have been actively covering up the truth about these visits.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. There really is a cosmic water gate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. Three, there are no good arguments against these conclusions, only people who haven't studied the relevant evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. And four, flying saucer visitations and the cosmic water gate represent the biggest story of the millennium.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. And I should say that I prefer the term flying saucer because all flying saucers are UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. Very few UFOs are flying saucers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. All great-grandfathers are men, not all men are great-grandfathers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. I'm interested in the flying saucers, not the UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. The basis for these conclusions, A, there are at least five large-scale scientific studies which provide substantial evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. These include Project Blue Book Special Report Number 14, the largest study ever done for the United States Air Force, covering more than 3,200 cases with more than 200 charts, tables, graphs, and maps.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. It is quality evaluation, cross-comparison between unknowns and knowns.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. The official press release lied about the data, I'll document that in a minute, is almost never referenced by UFO debunkers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. Dr. Carl Sagan, we were classmates at the University of Chicago, claimed there are interesting UFO sightings that are not reliable, and reliable UFO sightings that are not interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. But there are no cases that are both reliable and interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. This statement was not backed up by reference to data, but is directly contradicted by the Blue Book Special Report 14 data.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. It was found that the more reliable the case, the more likely to be unexplainable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. United States Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles, in the very widely distributed press release when the 1955 study was completed, flat out lied, it's a strong statement and I'm sorry to make it, but it's true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. He stated, "We believe that no objects such as those properly described as flying saucers have overflown the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. Even the unknown 3% could have been identified as conventional phenomena or illusions if more complete observational data had been available."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. The fact of the matter in the report that he was talking about is that the unknowns comprise 21.5% of the cases completely separate from the 9.3% listed as insufficient information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. The 3% number was a lie.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. Furthermore, a statistical comparison of the unknowns and knowns showed that the probability that the unknowns were just misknowns was less than 1%.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. It must further be noted that the press release did not give the title of the report or the company that did the work, Battelle Memorial Institute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. If they'd given the title, surely some newsman would have said, "Hey, what happened to reports one through 13?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. They'd never heard about them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. The correct answer, had it been given, would have been that they were all classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. It's a very valuable source of information, this report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. It's funny how the debunkers never talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. Another primary source of valuable data, which should be of interest to you all, are the congressional hearings of July 29, 1968, which included testimony from 12 scientists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. The most important paper was by Dr. James E. McDonald, professor of physics at the University of Arizona.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. He had talked to 500 witnesses, but he presented 41 outstanding cases, including multiple witness radar visual sightings, sightings by pilots, by astronomers, by meteorologists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. He noted physical trace cases of which, by now, more than 5,000 have been collected by Ted Phillips from 95 countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. They get dull, same thing was happening all over the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. Saucer is seen on the ground, it leaves, they find physical changes, happens here, it happens there, it happens everywhere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. One-sixth of those cases involved reports of small beings associated with the craft while it was on the ground.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. I was the youngest contributor to those, and I think the only survivor since then, to those hearings in 1968.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. And I was the only one without a PhD, that might tell you something, I'm not sure what.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. The proceedings, incidentally, are still available online.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. One of the contributors was Dr. J. Allen Hynek, chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern University, and for 20 years, United States Air Force scientific consultant to Project Blue Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. His book, The UFO Experience, a Scientific Inquiry, should be required reading by anybody who's going to talk about flying saucers, especially negatively.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. According to another source here, according to a special UFO subcommittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, world's largest group of space scientists, 30% of the 117 cases studied by the University of Colorado, government-sponsored study in the late '60s, and discussed in the Condon Report, Edward U. Condon, could not be identified, and yet the headline said, "Scientific study shows no UFOs."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

253. Totally untrue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. There's a two-volume report called the UFO Evidence, which has loads of data, hundreds of cases that couldn't be identified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. There's also the COMETA Report from France, which goes into numerous excellent officially involved cases in France.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. There are a dozen PhD theses about UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. One of them demonstrating how poor the press coverage has been.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

258. I haven't seen one about coverage by the scientific community or coverage by the political committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. That's another story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. Anybody need a PhD thesis topic?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. There's two good ones.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. Also a third one, the will not to believe on the part of scientists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. It's a sickness, a disease, if you will, infecting people who think they know all there is to know and don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. A really bad example of bias and ignorance appeared in Astronomy Magazine this month, May 2013, by Dr. Phil Plait.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. He does a blog, Bad Astronomy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. The title of the article, believe it or not, is The Science Behind UFOs, it's a cover story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. He somehow manages to mention none of the five large-scale scientific studies that I've just talked about, or any of the 5,000 physical trace cases, or any multiple witness radar visual cases, or abductions nor advanced technology studies at national labs and an industry showing trips to nearby stars in reasonable round-trip times using fusion propulsion are feasible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. I worked on fusion back in the early '60s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. To give you a form of reference, every star in the universe or multiverse produces its energy by nuclear fusion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. That's what H-bombs are all about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. And a good demonstration of the atom and the UFO together, if you will, is that in a very short period we managed to go from a 10-ton blockbuster, World War II, 1945, took a big B-29 to carry it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. That was in 1944, in 1945, the first A-bomb, 15,000 tons of TNT, not 10.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. Seven years later, which is nothing, cost a lot of money, we set off the first fusion device, an H-bomb, called Mike, incidentally.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. It released the energy of 10 million tons of TNT.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. So you go from 10 to 15,000 to 10 million tons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. And the Russians sent off one that was 50 million tons of TNT.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. The point is we know how to get to the stars if we want to spend the money.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. I'm not saying it's the ultimate technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. I'm saying scientific progress comes from doing things differently in an unpredictable way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. The future is not an extrapolation of the past.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. You have to change how you do things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. And what gets to me, having worked on fusion propulsion, fission propulsion, nuclear reactors for space applications, and all the rest of this, is that we tend to forget that if you make enough stupid assumptions, you can prove almost anything is impossible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. One quick example, one astronomer in 1941.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. He was fed up with all the science fiction stuff about going to the moon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. That was nonsense, he said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. So he published a scientific, in quotes, paper calculating the required initial launch weight of a rocket able to get a man to the moon and back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. Legitimate question, how big is it got to be?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. Pages of equations, he concluded it would have to weigh a million, million tons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. It was off by a factor of 300 million.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. Proving if you make enough stupid assumptions, you can prove anything is impossible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. So we have reason to be very careful when somebody says something is impossible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. I have a whole book, it's impossible, isn't it, was going to be the title, but science was wrong is what the publisher decided on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. I like the first one better, but anyway, let's look at another progression, not only in bombs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. Ferdinand Magellan's ship, he didn't make it, but his ship did, went around the planet in three years, in 1523, three years, three years before the mast, you might say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. Science fiction writers had going around the world in 80 days in the 19th century.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. The space station goes around the world in 90 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. Progress comes from doing things differently.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. A second problem I have found, I worked under security for 14 years for major companies like GE, GM, Westinghouse, McDonald Douglas, TRW systems, Aerojet-General Nucleonics, I set a record for working on cancelled government sponsored research and development programs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. Not intentionally, you understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. Another one of the false myths is that governments can't keep secrets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. Two astronomers have demonstrated this, Dr. Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute, S-E-T-I, that stands for Silly Effort to Investigate, incidentally, that's another story which I've written about in the book, said you can prove that the government can't keep secrets by how badly FEMA fouled up with Katrina and how poorly the post offices operated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. If you can see a connection between either of those things and governments keeping secrets, I sure can't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. He didn't mention the CIA, the DIA, the NRO, the NSA and all those other alphabet soup agencies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. Another great astronomer, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, head of Hayden Planetarium, he said the proof that governments can't keep secrets is shown by how much we know about President Clinton's genitalia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. Now if you can figure that one out you're better than I am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. Now the proof, and I'll show some of this in my lecture Tuesday night, about government cover-up, it's not just an idle concept.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. If you wish you can get a hold of 156 top-secret Umbra NSA UFO documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. They're not very interesting because all you can read is one sentence per page.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. Everything else is whited out, not blacked out, they said that was too impressive on television when I used that, they told me this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. And the reason is everything else is sources and methods.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. Twenty-eight percent sources and methods and two percent UFOs but it's filed under UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. Come on, that makes no sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. You can get a bunch of CIA, and I'll show some of these too, blacked out UFO documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. So highly redacted that you can read about six words per page.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. And my favorite thing, and it took me three years to get this, was one of the CIA UFO documents that says on the top, "Deny in Toto."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. They couldn't find six lousy words to declassify.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. Something's wrong here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. I have to tell you, one minute, okay, I won't tell you, maybe I'll tell you that Tuesday night.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. One more thing, Air Force General Carroll Bolander stated that UFO reports which could affect national security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. He was asked to look about what we should do about Project Blue Book, are not part of the Blue Book system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. UFO reports which could affect national security are not part of the Blue Book system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. Incredible statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. I located him, I talked to him on the phone, he verified there are two separate reporting channels.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. He never heard that from the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. His job was to decide what to do about Project Blue Book, and it was canceled because of this memo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. But the public never heard that he said, "Reports which could affect national security are not part of the Blue Book system."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. People are surprised.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. Just one more sentence here, two sentences.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. I've won several debates on UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. I've only had 11 hecklers and over 700 lectures.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. It's past time for the press, scientific and political communities to do their homework.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. And I should add at least three UFO crashes have occurred.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. You'll hear more about those later in these hearings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
