→ {"text": "UFO 問題已經涉及全球軍事人員超過 60 年，並且被保密所籠罩。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. Because this subject is so widely ridiculed, it's important to stress why it's worthy of serious attention.
→ {"text": "由於這個主題廣泛受到嘲笑，因此必須強調為什麼它值得認真關注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. Stories of strange objects in the sky actually go far back in time, but from the 1940s to our own era, military personnel from the United States and many other nations have encountered unidentified flying objects, visually or on radar or both, sometimes at close range.
→ {"text": "關於天空中奇怪物體的故事實際上可以追溯到很久以前，但從 1940 年代至今，美國與許多其他國家的軍事人員都遭遇過不明飛行物，無論是目視、雷達偵測，或是兩者皆有，有時是在近距離接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. These events happen not scores of times, but hundreds of times, perhaps thousands.
→ {"text": "這些事件不是發生幾十次，而是數百次，甚至可能數千次。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. Sometimes the encounter was nothing more than a solid radar return of an object moving at an incomprehensible speed, performing impossible maneuvers.
→ {"text": "有時遭遇只不過是雷達回波顯示一個物體以難以理解的速度移動，執行不可能的機動動作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. In a few others, it involved injury and even death to military personnel.

91. The CIA, the NSA, and all branches of military intelligence have historically received UFO reports and discussed the matter as something of serious concern.
→ {"text": "CIA、NSA 以及所有軍事情報部門歷來都收到 UFO 報告，並將此事視為嚴重關切事項進行討論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. And yet, the military and other branches of government have created the fiction for public consumption only that the UFO problem is nothing to be concerned about, certainly not the result of little green men.
→ {"text": "然而，軍方和其他政府部門僅為公眾消費創造了一個虛構說法，聲稱 UFO 問題不值得關注，當然也不是小綠人所為。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. We are fortunate that starting in the 1970s, the US Freedom of Information Act began to help researchers learn some of the truth that lay behind the facade of propaganda.
→ {"text": "幸運的是，從 1970 年代開始，美國資訊自由法開始幫助研究人員了解隱藏在宣傳表象背後的部分真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. We learned, for example, that some US military analysts initially feared that the Soviet Union might be behind the flying saucer wave of the 1940s and '50s.
→ {"text": "例如，我們得知一些美國軍事分析師最初擔心蘇聯可能是 1940 和 50 年代飛碟潮背後的幕後黑手。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. And indeed, options quickly narrowed.

→ {"text": "早在 1947 年底，萊特-帕特森空軍基地空軍技術情報中心（ATIC）的一批分析師就相信 UFO 具有外星起源。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. The response?

102. The team was dispersed and reassigned.
→ {"text": "該團隊被解散並重新分配。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. Yet thanks to FOIA and the courage of a few senior officials to go on the record, we have a collection of statements about UFOs that are so numerous as to be impossible to mention all of them here.
→ {"text": "然而，感謝資訊自由法以及少數高階官員公開作證的勇氣，我們收集到大量關於 UFO 的聲明，數量之多以至於無法在此一一提及。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. But a few might give you an appropriate flavor of what I mean.

109. Landry went on to say that he continued to brief President Truman in conjunction with the CIA quarterly for the rest of the Truman presidency.
→ {"text": "蘭德里接著說，在杜魯門總統任期的剩餘時間裡，他繼續與 CIA 一起每季向杜魯門總統簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. That's no less than 16 briefings.
→ {"text": "那至少是 16 次簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. We might want to know why a man as busy as President Truman was, why he would take the time out of his schedule to have so many meetings about UFOs, and yet we have no official transcript or record of those briefings.
→ {"text": "我們可能想知道，像杜魯門總統這樣忙碌的人，為什麼會從日程中抽出時間召開這麼多關於 UFO 的會議，然而我們卻沒有這些簡報的正式記錄或紀錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

112. This is a statement from a top secret 1948 Air Force intelligence report called Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S., "The frequency of reported sightings, the similarity in many of the characteristics attributed to the observed objects, and the quality of observers considered as a whole, support the contention that some type of flying object has been observed.
→ {"text": "這是一份 1948 年最高機密空軍情報報告的聲明，該報告名為《美國飛行物體事件分析》：「報告目擊的頻率、歸因於觀測物體的許多特徵的相似性，以及觀察者的整體素質，都支持某種類型的飛行物體確實被觀測到的論點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. The origin of the devices is not ascertainable."
→ {"text": "這些裝置的起源無法確定。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. And just two more quotations here I want to give you, an Air Force intelligence report from 1951 relating to an aerial encounter by a U.S. fighter pilot.
→ {"text": "我還想再給各位兩段引文，一份 1951 年的空軍情報報告，涉及一名美國戰鬥機飛行員的空中遭遇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. "Described as flat on top and bottom and appearing from a front view to have round edges and slightly beveled," quite a bit of detail there, "no vapor trails or exhaust or visible means of propulsion described as traveling at tremendous speed."
→ {"text": "「被描述為頂部和底部平坦，從正面看具有圓邊並略微斜角，」這裡有相當多的細節，「沒有蒸氣軌跡或排氣或可見的推進方式，被描述為以極快速度行進。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. And one more quote from the early years, this one from a former head of the CIA, Roscoe Hillencutter, speaking in 1960, "Behind the scenes, high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs, but through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense."
→ {"text": "還有一段早期的引文，這段來自 CIA 前局長羅斯科·希倫庫特，他在 1960 年說：「在幕後，高階空軍軍官嚴肅地關注 UFO，但透過官方保密與嘲笑，許多公民被引導相信這些不明飛行物體是無稽之談。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. Now how much clearer a statement should responsible citizens, academicians, media, and political leadership require before demanding to get some reasonable answers as to what is going on behind the scenes in relation to the phenomenon of UFOs?
→ {"text": "那麼，負責任的公民、學者、媒體和政治領導人還需要多清楚的聲明，才會要求就 UFO 現象幕後發生的事情獲得一些合理的答案？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. Because the problem certainly did not end during the 1960s or 1970s or 1980s, but has continued to the present day.
→ {"text": "因為這個問題絕對沒有在 1960、1970 或 1980 年代結束，而是持續至今。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "多架噴射戰鬥機追逐多個大型未知物體，這些物體呈現藍色和橙色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "所有目擊者——其中兩位我親自訪問過，還有幾位向全國媒體發言——都描述了這些物體驚人的性能和能力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

125. Now perhaps we might like to know precisely which things.
→ {"text": "那麼，也許我們會想確切知道是哪些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. What blue object can descend at an 80 degree angle, stop, reverse course, and accelerate away from two F-16 jets near the nation's capital in post-9/11 America?
→ {"text": "什麼藍色物體能夠以 80 度角下降、停止、反轉方向，然後在 9/11 後的美國首都附近加速遠離兩架 F-16 噴射機？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. It might be an interesting question to ponder.

→ {"text": "我們再次要問，在世界上最繁忙的機場之一上空，這可能是什麼，為什麼會有堅定的沉默與否認？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. These are only some of the better known recent cases.

137. The two largest websites for collecting North American UFO reports, the National UFO Reporting Center and the Mutual UFO Network, have a combined total of well over 10,000 reports every year.
