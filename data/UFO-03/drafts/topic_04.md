→ {"text": "主流世界也選擇忽視洛克菲勒家族成員之一的這一非傳統面向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. His long official biography posted online by the Rockefeller Archive Center doesn't mention any of his UFO, paranormal, new age, and consciousness-oriented interests, and neither did the long obituaries published by the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other mainstream publications when he died in 2004 at the age of 94.
→ {"text": "洛克菲勒檔案中心（Rockefeller Archive Center）線上發布的長篇官方傳記並未提及他對不明飛行物、超自然現象、新時代運動與意識研究的任何興趣；當他於 2004 年以 94 歲高齡辭世時，《紐約時報》、《華盛頓郵報》及其他主流出版物刊登的長篇訃告也未提及這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "在無法取得他的財務記錄的情況下，無從得知他投入了多少資金，但至少應有數百萬美元。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. Although I never met him personally, I know something about it because I had the opportunity of working firsthand in one of Lawrence Rockefeller's sponsored projects, the UFO briefing document, The Best Available Evidence, a special report published in December 1995 sent to the White House, selected members of Congress, and VIPs, which is now available for free at the OpenMinds.tv website.
→ {"text": "儘管我從未親自見過他，但我對此有所了解，因為我有機會直接參與勞倫斯·洛克菲勒（Lawrence Rockefeller）資助的其中一個項目，即《UFO 簡報文件：最佳可得證據》（UFO Briefing Document: The Best Available Evidence）。這份特別報告於 1995 年 12 月出版，送交白宮、特定國會議員與重要人士，現可於 OpenMinds.tv 網站免費取得。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. Long before the term exopolitics was in vogue, Lawrence Rockefeller was practicing it in the White House from 1993 to 1996.
→ {"text": "早在「外星政治學」（exopolitics）一詞流行之前，勞倫斯·洛克菲勒（Lawrence Rockefeller）就於 1993 年至 1996 年間在白宮實踐此理念。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. This has come to be known as the Rockefeller UFO Initiative, a multi-pronged campaign to get the U.S. government to release sensitive information on UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence.
→ {"text": "這成為後來所知的「洛克菲勒不明飛行物倡議」（Rockefeller UFO Initiative），一項多管齊下的運動，旨在促使美國政府公開不明飛行物與外星智慧的敏感資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. The initiative is documented in hundreds of pages of correspondence, released a few years ago by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, or STP, under the Freedom of Information Act.

224. It is not necessary to go into the biographical background of Mr. Rockefeller in this short presentation, except to note that he was one of the original grandsons of the founder of the dynasty, John D. Rockefeller, that he was obviously extremely wealthy and well-connected, that he had studied philosophy at Princeton and was quite a visionary even in business, where he seemed to be always ahead of the curve, backing aeronautics in the '30s, electronics in the '60s, and conservation and environmental efforts throughout his long career.
→ {"text": "在此簡短陳述中無需深入探討洛克菲勒先生的傳記背景，僅需說明他是洛克菲勒家族創始人約翰·D·洛克菲勒（John D. Rockefeller）的嫡孫之一，顯然極為富有且人脈廣闊，曾在普林斯頓大學（Princeton）研讀哲學，即使在商業領域也是一位極具遠見的人物，似乎總是走在時代前端，在 30 年代支持航空學、60 年代支持電子學，並在其漫長職業生涯中持續投入保育與環境保護工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. Although the mainstream media chose to ignore it, his intense interest in UFOs and ET issues in the '90s fits very well with this pattern.
→ {"text": "儘管主流媒體選擇忽視，他在 90 年代對不明飛行物與外星生命議題的濃厚興趣，與這種模式非常吻合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. Mr. Rockefeller backed many UFO-related projects in the period between the late '80s and 2000, but for the purpose of this hearing, we will concentrate on his political initiatives in these areas.
→ {"text": "洛克菲勒先生在 80 年代末期至 2000 年間支持了許多不明飛行物相關項目，但就本聽證會的目的而言，我們將專注於他在這些領域的政治倡議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. Lawrence Rockefeller's first forays in ufology started sometime in the late '80s through Dr. Cecil B. Scott-Jones, a parapsychologist and former U.S. Navy commander who had worked as naval attache in Asia and at the Naval Scientific and Technical Intelligence Center.
→ {"text": "勞倫斯·洛克菲勒（Lawrence Rockefeller）首次涉足不明飛行物學（ufology）始於 80 年代末期，透過塞西爾·B·史考特-瓊斯博士（Dr. Cecil B. Scott-Jones），他是一位超心理學家與前美國海軍指揮官，曾擔任駐亞洲海軍武官，並於海軍科學與技術情報中心（Naval Scientific and Technical Intelligence Center）工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Whisper 轉錄錯誤：原文 'topology' 應為 'ufology'"}

228. Between 1985 and 1991, Jones was special assistant to Senator Claiborne Pell, the powerful Rhode Island Democrat chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who was deeply interested in parapsychology and who probably many of you met personally.
→ {"text": "在 1985 年至 1991 年間，Jones 擔任克萊伯恩·佩爾參議員（Senator Claiborne Pell）的特別助理，這位羅德島州民主黨籍的有力人士擔任參議院外交關係委員會（Senate Foreign Relations Committee）主席，對超心理學深感興趣，各位許多人可能親自見過他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. Senator Pell was also friends with Lawrence Rockefeller and both served on the board of the Human Potential Foundation, a small think tank launched in 1989 in Vienna, Virginia by Jones to conduct "research into all conditions of humankind, physiological, psychological, and spiritual."

230. Many of the papers released by the White House OSTP come from Scott-Jones, who knew Dr. John Gibbons, a physicist who worked for many years as director of the Office of Technology Assessment for the U.S. Congress and was appointed in 1993 by the Clinton administration to direct the OSTP.
→ {"text": "白宮科學技術政策辦公室（White House OSTP）公開的許多文件來自 Scott-Jones，他認識約翰·吉本斯博士（Dr. John Gibbons），一位物理學家，多年來擔任美國國會技術評估辦公室（Office of Technology Assessment）主任，並於 1993 年由柯林頓政府任命主管科學技術政策辦公室。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. What was the exact turning point of Lawrence Rockefeller's evolution from a general interest in consciousness studies into the specific area of UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence is still unclear, but the end of the Cold War and the arrival in Washington of a younger generation represented by Bill and Hillary Clinton are key factors.
→ {"text": "勞倫斯·洛克菲勒（Lawrence Rockefeller）從對意識研究的一般興趣演變至專注於不明飛行物與外星智慧此一特定領域的確切轉捩點尚不清楚，但冷戰結束，以及由比爾與希拉蕊·柯林頓（Bill and Hillary Clinton）所代表的新世代抵達華盛頓，都是關鍵因素。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "洛克菲勒為這些工作招募了長期合作夥伴亨利·L·戴蒙德（Henry L. Diamond），一位來自華盛頓特區的環境律師，他與洛克菲勒家族的連結可追溯至 1960 年代，當時他與勞倫斯在保育活動中合作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. Diamond also knew John Gibbons, and so he was the right person to make the first contact with the OSTP chief when he sent a memorandum on March 29, 1993, requesting a meeting, and I'm quoting now the first paragraph.
→ {"text": "戴蒙德（Diamond）也認識約翰·吉本斯（John Gibbons），因此他是與科學技術政策辦公室主管進行首次接觸的合適人選。他於 1993 年 3 月 29 日發送一份備忘錄，請求會面。我現在引述第一段內容：", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "從記錄中我們得知，在與吉本斯（Gibbons）的初次會面與後續通信之後，政府決定將更廣泛的不明飛行物議題縮減至 1947 年 7 月發生於新墨西哥州羅斯威爾（Roswell， New Mexico）的特定且著名的不明飛行物墜毀事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. This incident will be discussed in detail at a later session during this hearing.
→ {"text": "此事件將在本聽證會稍後的會議中詳細討論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240.

→ {"text": "在忽視此事數十年後，空軍終於決定發表重大公開聲明，於 1994 年發布官方報告，將該事件解釋或駁斥為偵測蘇聯首次原子彈試爆的一次性秘密氣球計畫，代號「莫古爾計畫」（Project Mogul）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. The original draft was written by Don Berliner, an aviation journalist and long-time ufologist with the Fund for UFO Research, FUFOR, in the Washington area, and I was brought in to help edit and expand the document from a small office ran by Marie Galbraith in New York's Madison Avenue.
