## Speaker Group 1

145. As I explained this morning, my name is Grant Cameron.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. I'm a private investigator for 38 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. I've spent most of my time looking at what the highest levels of U.S. government, military and intelligence agencies know about the UFO phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. This afternoon, I'm speaking about the Rockefeller Initiative.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. My testimony is based on 1,000 pages of documents that were released to me in 2001 by the Clinton White House in response to a FOIA for UFO files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. It should be noted here that, like the documents you were talking about this morning, the Roswell documents that disappeared, these documents have now disappeared.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. Both the National Archives and the Clinton Library both maintain they do not have the documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. For example, I filed an FOIAA with the Clinton Library.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. I received about 1,000 pages of UFO documents, which included an awful lot of material that Stephen Greer had said to the President.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. The 1,000 pages that I'm going to talk about right now were not part of the disclosure, and both maintain that they don't have them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. They are on my website, the President's UFO website, and basically what the documents show, these FOIAA documents show that billionaire businessman Lawrence Rockefeller had approached the White House to get the government to disclose the truth behind the UFO mystery.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. There was different Rockefellers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. There was Nelson Rockefeller, who was the political guy who ran for government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. There was David, who was the money guy, and Lawrence Rockefeller was this sort of humanitarian, had a philosophy degree from Princeton, and was very interested in this phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. Rockefeller also had other meetings outside the White House.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. One example was with Republican Stephen Horn, Republican from California, from the Government Reform and Oversight Committee related to government secrecy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. Rockefeller's request for UFO disclosure was dealt with in the White House by the President's science advisor, Dr. Jack Gibbons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. To prepare for the first meeting in March of 1993 with Rockefeller, Dr. Gibbons requested a UFO briefing from the CIA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. That briefing was tasked at the CIA to Dr. Ronald Pandolfi.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. So if you want to know, that's probably the guy you should be phoning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. Dr. Ronald Pandolfi, who's been identified by the New York Times as the top scientist in the CIA, and a man who is rumored inside the UFO community as the agency expert on UFOs, and a man that over the last 20 years has repeatedly interacted with many researchers inside the UFO community.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. As the CIA has a public position of no UFO involvement, Pandolfi gave the job of writing the White House briefing, which he knew would become public because Lawrence Rockefeller was involved.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. He gave that briefing job to a private UFO researcher, Mr. Bruce Maccabee, who had done a couple of UFO lunchtime talks at the CIA headquarters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. The briefing therefore became not an official briefing on the subject, but just a personal opinion of one researcher inside the UFO community.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. Rockefeller exerted great pressure on the Clinton White House, threatening to write an open letter demanding UFO disclosure from President Clinton, and to make this demand public in full-page ads in all the major newspapers in the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. Under this pressure, Dr. Gibbons agreed to try to get some sort of disclosure on the UFO subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. He asked Mr. Rockefeller to pick one case that could be declassified, and then all the rest of the cover-up material could be dealt with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. Mr. Rockefeller picked the 1947 UFO crash at Roswell as the case to investigate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. And that is one of the reasons why there was a reinvestigation of the Roswell crash by the U.S. Air Force in 1994.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. The U.S. Air Force did not decide to do it on their own.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. At the same time, the White House was green-lighting a reinvestigation of Roswell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. The Government Accountability Office was also doing a reinvestigation of the Roswell crash.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. That investigation was initiated by New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff, who ordered the GAO investigation after his requests for information were stonewalled by Clinton's first Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. The GAO study, however, was quite limited; only FOIA replies on the Roswell crash were used.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. Nothing was found except that a bunch of key Roswell documents from the time of the crash that would have indicated what had happened were missing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. Therefore, no conclusion was offered.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. The U.S. Air Force reinvestigation discovered a way to bypass the actual reinvestigation of the crash, rather than following the testimony of many of the witnesses that will be appearing here this week.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. They simply published a final report stating that the whole 1947 crash event had been caused by the launch of a mogul balloon designed to monitor a possible Soviet nuclear test.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. In 1995, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, President Clinton challenged the official U.S. Air Force Roswell report, which had no discussion of the reported alien bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. In a speech that he gave, he stated, "As far as I know, an alien spacecraft did not crash in Roswell, New Mexico, but if the United States Air Force did recover alien bodies, they didn't tell me about it either, and I want to know."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. This open challenge in Northern Ireland forced the U.S. Air Force to do a second Roswell crash report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. The U.S. Air Force released this report to a room of laughing reporters as they described how six-foot tall wooden dummies dressed in Air Force uniforms in 1953 somehow explained what people had described as small four-foot gray creatures in 1947, including one alien that was still alive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. The report was the Air Force's lame attempt intended to answer Clinton's challenge about the alien bodies mentioned in Belfast.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. Without any official record of the event, Lawrence Rockefeller did sit down with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and most of those documents were provided by Stephen Greer, who provided them to Lawrence Rockefeller.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. They met at the Wyoming JY Ranch, which was controlled by the Rockefellers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. Rockefeller briefed both Bill and Hillary Clinton on the best available evidence for UFOs and for the need to make that information available to the American people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. The mention of Hillary's name in the 1995 briefing at the Rockefeller Ranch is important because the Rockefeller Initiative documents that I recovered show that Hillary played a key role in the Rockefeller White House initiative on UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. There are two key documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. In November 1, 1995, there's a letter from Rockefeller's lawyer to the president's science advisor, and in that it points out that Hillary and her staff have been helping Lawrence Rockefeller edit a letter of UFO disclosure to the president.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. The letter was called "Lifting Secrecy of Information about Extraterrestrial Intelligence as Part of the Current Classification Review."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. What was happening was Lawrence was sending this document to various people, and he would threaten to send the letter to the president if he didn't get cooperation, and various people helped him edit the letter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. Hillary was one of the people who helped edit this letter on UFO disclosure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. In a second 1996 letter from Rockefeller to the president's science advisor, in the letter he clearly spells out the information that is coming from Rockefeller to the science advisor to President Clinton, and from President Clinton's science advisor to Rockefeller, all that material is going through Hillary Clinton's First Lady's office.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. In 2006, the initiative faded out after the briefing at the ranch, and Rockefeller moved on to fund other UFO research activities. 1996, pardon me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
