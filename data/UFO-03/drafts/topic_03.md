151. Both the National Archives and the Clinton Library both maintain they do not have the documents.

152. For example, I filed an FOIAA with the Clinton Library.
→ {"text": "例如，我曾向柯林頓總統圖書館提交了一份資訊自由法申請。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文為 FOIAA，應為 FOIA 之轉錄錯誤"}

153. I received about 1,000 pages of UFO documents, which included an awful lot of material that Stephen Greer had said to the President.
→ {"text": "我收到了約 1，000 頁的不明飛行物文件，其中包含大量 Stephen Greer 向總統提供的資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. The 1,000 pages that I'm going to talk about right now were not part of the disclosure, and both maintain that they don't have them.
→ {"text": "我現在要談的這 1，000 頁文件並不在那次公開範圍內，兩個機構都聲稱沒有這些文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. They are on my website, the President's UFO website, and basically what the documents show, these FOIAA documents show that billionaire businessman Lawrence Rockefeller had approached the White House to get the government to disclose the truth behind the UFO mystery.
→ {"text": "這些文件已上傳至我的網站「總統的不明飛行物網站」（President's UFO website）。這些資訊自由法文件基本上顯示，億萬富翁勞倫斯·洛克菲勒（Lawrence Rockefeller）曾向白宮施壓，要求政府揭露不明飛行物謎團背後的真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文為 FOIAA，應為 FOIA 之轉錄錯誤"}

156. There was different Rockefellers.

→ {"text": "有納爾遜·洛克菲勒（Nelson Rockefeller），他是從事政治、競選公職的成員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "有大衛（David），他是負責財務的成員。而勞倫斯·洛克菲勒則是一位人道主義者，擁有普林斯頓大學（Princeton）哲學學位，對這個現象非常感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. Rockefeller also had other meetings outside the White House.

161. Rockefeller's request for UFO disclosure was dealt with in the White House by the President's science advisor, Dr. Jack Gibbons.
→ {"text": "洛克菲勒要求揭露不明飛行物資訊的請求，在白宮是由總統科學顧問傑克·吉本斯博士（Dr. Jack Gibbons）處理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. To prepare for the first meeting in March of 1993 with Rockefeller, Dr. Gibbons requested a UFO briefing from the CIA.
→ {"text": "為了準備 1993 年 3 月與洛克菲勒的首次會議，吉本斯博士向 CIA 要求提供不明飛行物簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. That briefing was tasked at the CIA to Dr. Ronald Pandolfi.
→ {"text": "該簡報在 CIA 內部被指派給羅納德·潘多爾菲博士（Dr. Ronald Pandolfi）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. So if you want to know, that's probably the guy you should be phoning.
→ {"text": "所以如果你們想知道真相，他可能就是你們應該打電話詢問的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

165. Dr. Ronald Pandolfi, who's been identified by the New York Times as the top scientist in the CIA, and a man who is rumored inside the UFO community as the agency expert on UFOs, and a man that over the last 20 years has repeatedly interacted with many researchers inside the UFO community.
→ {"text": "羅納德·潘多爾菲博士被《紐約時報》（New York Times）認定為 CIA 的頂尖科學家，在不明飛行物社群中傳聞他是該機構的不明飛行物專家，而且在過去 20 年來，他曾多次與不明飛行物社群內的許多研究者互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. As the CIA has a public position of no UFO involvement, Pandolfi gave the job of writing the White House briefing, which he knew would become public because Lawrence Rockefeller was involved.
→ {"text": "由於 CIA 的公開立場是不涉入不明飛行物事務，潘多爾菲將撰寫白宮簡報的工作委託出去，因為他知道這份簡報會因為勞倫斯·洛克菲勒的參與而成為公開資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

167. He gave that briefing job to a private UFO researcher, Mr. Bruce Maccabee, who had done a couple of UFO lunchtime talks at the CIA headquarters.
→ {"text": "他將這項簡報工作交給了一位民間不明飛行物研究者布魯斯·麥卡比先生（Mr. Bruce Maccabee），他曾在 CIA 總部進行過幾次午餐時間的不明飛行物演講。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. The briefing therefore became not an official briefing on the subject, but just a personal opinion of one researcher inside the UFO community.
→ {"text": "因此，這份簡報並非關於此議題的官方簡報，而只是不明飛行物社群內一位研究者的個人意見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. Rockefeller exerted great pressure on the Clinton White House, threatening to write an open letter demanding UFO disclosure from President Clinton, and to make this demand public in full-page ads in all the major newspapers in the United States.
→ {"text": "洛克菲勒對柯林頓白宮施加了巨大壓力，威脅要撰寫公開信要求柯林頓總統揭露不明飛行物資訊，並透過全美所有主要報紙的全版廣告將這項要求公諸於世。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. Under this pressure, Dr. Gibbons agreed to try to get some sort of disclosure on the UFO subject.
→ {"text": "在這種壓力下，吉本斯博士同意嘗試在不明飛行物議題上進行某種程度的揭露。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. He asked Mr. Rockefeller to pick one case that could be declassified, and then all the rest of the cover-up material could be dealt with.
→ {"text": "他要求洛克菲勒先生選擇一個可以解密的案例，然後再處理其餘的真相掩蓋材料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. Mr. Rockefeller picked the 1947 UFO crash at Roswell as the case to investigate.
→ {"text": "洛克菲勒先生選擇了 1947 年羅斯威爾不明飛行物墜毀事件作為調查案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. And that is one of the reasons why there was a reinvestigation of the Roswell crash by the U.S. Air Force in 1994.
→ {"text": "這就是美國空軍於 1994 年重新調查羅斯威爾墜毀事件的原因之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

174. The U.S. Air Force did not decide to do it on their own.
→ {"text": "美國空軍並非自行決定進行調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. At the same time, the White House was green-lighting a reinvestigation of Roswell.
→ {"text": "與此同時，白宮正批准重新調查羅斯威爾事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. The Government Accountability Office was also doing a reinvestigation of the Roswell crash.
→ {"text": "美國政府問責署也在重新調查羅斯威爾墜毀事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

177. That investigation was initiated by New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff, who ordered the GAO investigation after his requests for information were stonewalled by Clinton's first Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin.
→ {"text": "該調查由新墨西哥州眾議員史蒂文·希夫（Congressman Steven Schiff）發起，他在柯林頓首任國防部長萊斯·阿斯平（Les Aspin）阻撓其資訊請求後，下令政府問責署進行調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

178. The GAO study, however, was quite limited; only FOIA replies on the Roswell crash were used.
→ {"text": "然而，政府問責署的研究相當有限，僅使用了關於羅斯威爾墜毀事件的資訊自由法回覆。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

179. Nothing was found except that a bunch of key Roswell documents from the time of the crash that would have indicated what had happened were missing.
→ {"text": "除了發現一批本應顯示事件真相的羅斯威爾墜毀時期關鍵文件已經消失之外，並未發現任何東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. Therefore, no conclusion was offered.
→ {"text": "因此，未提出任何結論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

181. The U.S. Air Force reinvestigation discovered a way to bypass the actual reinvestigation of the crash, rather than following the testimony of many of the witnesses that will be appearing here this week.
→ {"text": "美國空軍的重新調查找到了一種繞過實際調查墜毀事件的方法，而非遵循本週將在此出席的許多證人的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. They simply published a final report stating that the whole 1947 crash event had been caused by the launch of a mogul balloon designed to monitor a possible Soviet nuclear test.
→ {"text": "他們只是發布了一份最終報告，聲稱整個 1947 年墜毀事件是由用於監測蘇聯可能進行核試驗的莫古爾計畫氣球（mogul balloon）發射所造成。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. In 1995, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, President Clinton challenged the official U.S. Air Force Roswell report, which had no discussion of the reported alien bodies.
→ {"text": "1995 年，柯林頓總統在北愛爾蘭貝爾法斯特（Belfast， Northern Ireland）質疑美國空軍官方羅斯威爾報告，因為該報告完全沒有討論被報導的外星存有屍體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. In a speech that he gave, he stated, "As far as I know, an alien spacecraft did not crash in Roswell, New Mexico, but if the United States Air Force did recover alien bodies, they didn't tell me about it either, and I want to know."
→ {"text": "他在演講中表示：「就我所知，外星飛行器並未在新墨西哥州羅斯威爾墜毀，但如果美國空軍確實回收了外星存有屍體，他們也沒有告訴我，而我想知道真相。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. This open challenge in Northern Ireland forced the U.S. Air Force to do a second Roswell crash report.
→ {"text": "這個在北愛爾蘭的公開質疑迫使美國空軍製作第二份羅斯威爾墜毀報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. The U.S. Air Force released this report to a room of laughing reporters as they described how six-foot tall wooden dummies dressed in Air Force uniforms in 1953 somehow explained what people had described as small four-foot gray creatures in 1947, including one alien that was still alive.
→ {"text": "美國空軍在一屋子哄堂大笑的記者面前發布了這份報告，他們描述 1953 年穿著空軍制服的六英呎高木製假人如何能夠解釋人們在 1947 年所描述的四英呎高灰色小生物，其中還包括一個仍然存活的外星存有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. The report was the Air Force's lame attempt intended to answer Clinton's challenge about the alien bodies mentioned in Belfast.
→ {"text": "這份報告是空軍對柯林頓在貝爾法斯特提到的外星存有屍體質疑所做的蹩腳回應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

188. Without any official record of the event, Lawrence Rockefeller did sit down with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and most of those documents were provided by Stephen Greer, who provided them to Lawrence Rockefeller.
→ {"text": "儘管沒有此事件的官方記錄，勞倫斯·洛克菲勒確實與比爾·柯林頓（Bill Clinton）和希拉蕊·柯林頓（Hillary Clinton）會面，而大部分文件是由 Stephen Greer 提供給勞倫斯·洛克菲勒的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. They met at the Wyoming JY Ranch, which was controlled by the Rockefellers.
→ {"text": "他們在懷俄明州的 JY 牧場（Wyoming JY Ranch）會面，該牧場由洛克菲勒家族控制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. Rockefeller briefed both Bill and Hillary Clinton on the best available evidence for UFOs and for the need to make that information available to the American people.
→ {"text": "洛克菲勒向比爾·柯林頓和希拉蕊·柯林頓簡報了不明飛行物的最佳可得證據，以及將這些資訊提供給美國人民的必要性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. The mention of Hillary's name in the 1995 briefing at the Rockefeller Ranch is important because the Rockefeller Initiative documents that I recovered show that Hillary played a key role in the Rockefeller White House initiative on UFOs.
→ {"text": "在 1995 年洛克菲勒牧場簡報中提到希拉蕊的名字很重要，因為我取得的洛克菲勒倡議文件顯示，希拉蕊在洛克菲勒針對白宮的不明飛行物倡議中扮演了關鍵角色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. There are two key documents.
→ {"text": "有兩份關鍵文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. In November 1, 1995, there's a letter from Rockefeller's lawyer to the president's science advisor, and in that it points out that Hillary and her staff have been helping Lawrence Rockefeller edit a letter of UFO disclosure to the president.
→ {"text": "1995 年 11 月 1 日，洛克菲勒的律師寄給總統科學顧問一封信，信中指出希拉蕊及其幕僚一直在協助勞倫斯·洛克菲勒編輯一封要求總統揭露不明飛行物資訊的信函。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. The letter was called "Lifting Secrecy of Information about Extraterrestrial Intelligence as Part of the Current Classification Review."
→ {"text": "這封信的標題為「將外星智慧資訊解密作為當前機密審查的一部分」（Lifting Secrecy of Information about Extraterrestrial Intelligence as Part of the Current Classification Review）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. What was happening was Lawrence was sending this document to various people, and he would threaten to send the letter to the president if he didn't get cooperation, and various people helped him edit the letter.
→ {"text": "當時的情況是，勞倫斯將這份文件寄給各界人士，並威脅若得不到合作就會將信函寄給總統，而各界人士協助他編輯這封信。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

196. Hillary was one of the people who helped edit this letter on UFO disclosure.
→ {"text": "希拉蕊是協助編輯這封不明飛行物揭露信函的人士之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. In a second 1996 letter from Rockefeller to the president's science advisor, in the letter he clearly spells out the information that is coming from Rockefeller to the science advisor to President Clinton, and from President Clinton's science advisor to Rockefeller, all that material is going through Hillary Clinton's First Lady's office.
→ {"text": "在 1996 年洛克菲勒寄給總統科學顧問的第二封信中，他明確指出從洛克菲勒傳給柯林頓總統科學顧問的資訊，以及從柯林頓總統科學顧問傳給洛克菲勒的資訊，所有這些材料都經由希拉蕊·柯林頓的第一夫人辦公室傳遞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. In 2006, the initiative faded out after the briefing at the ranch, and Rockefeller moved on to fund other UFO research activities. 1996, pardon me.
→ {"text": "2006 年——抱歉，是 1996 年——在牧場簡報之後，該倡議逐漸淡出，洛克菲勒轉而資助其他不明飛行物研究活動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
