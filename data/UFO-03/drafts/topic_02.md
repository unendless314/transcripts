## Speaker Group 1

85. Daniel.
→ {"text": "Daniel。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. I'd like to address the issue from the point of view of a practicing attorney in these particular areas.
→ {"text": "我想從執業律師的角度來探討這些特定領域的議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. I just touched on it briefly earlier in the other panel that when I was at the Cahill Gordon law firm in New York, we were brought the Pentagon Papers at that time, and Jim Goodell, the chief counsel for the New York Times contacted us.
→ {"text": "我在先前的小組中簡短提到過，當時我在紐約的 Cahill Gordon 律師事務所工作，五角大樓文件（Pentagon Papers）被送到我們手中，《紐約時報》首席法律顧問 Jim Goodell 與我們聯繫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. I had been working on the briefs for the New York Times because I happened to have initiated the case that established the right of journalists to protect their confidential news sources when I was at the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review.
→ {"text": "我當時正在為《紐約時報》撰寫訴訟摘要，因為我在哈佛民權法律評論（Harvard Civil Rights Law Review）任職期間，恰好發起了確立記者保護機密消息來源權利的案件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

89. So I was at the firm and was working on the briefs, and Jim Goodell brought us the information that they had the Pentagon Papers, and so it was the first time that I found myself in a situation where I had to kind of try to put myself in the shoes of people that I had the luxury prior to that time of just saying, "We ought to get it all out.
→ {"text": "所以我在事務所工作並撰寫訴訟摘要時，Jim Goodell 告知我們他們取得了五角大樓文件。這是我第一次發現自己身處這樣的處境：我必須設身處地為他人著想，而在此之前我一直享有輕鬆地說出「我們應該全部公開」的特權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. We ought to just reveal everything.
→ {"text": "我們應該全部揭露。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

91. We ought to tell all the people have a right to know everything."
→ {"text": "我們應該告訴所有人，他們有權知道一切。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. And I found myself in this peculiar situation of starting to ask questions about what might be in there that we had to try to be careful about revealing.
→ {"text": "然而我發現自己處於這種特殊境地，開始質問其中可能包含什麼內容，是我們在揭露時必須謹慎的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. Now in that particular case, it wasn't a hard question because we found things about the assassination program of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Phoenix program.
→ {"text": "在那個案件中，答案並不難找，因為我們發現了中央情報局（Central Intelligence Agency）的暗殺計畫，即鳳凰計畫（Phoenix program）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. We found out that they were smuggling opium in Southeast Asia to help fund it.
→ {"text": "我們發現他們在東南亞走私鴉片以資助該計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. We found out about the Nugan Hand Bank that was set up by Theodore Shackley, who was the CIA station chief in Saigon.
→ {"text": "我們發現了紐根漢德銀行（Nugan Hand Bank），該銀行是由 CIA 西貢站長西奧多·謝克利（Theodore Shackley）設立的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. All the things that we found out about in that particular instance I felt were criminal conduct, unlawful conduct.
→ {"text": "在那個案件中我們發現的所有事情，我認為都是犯罪行為、違法行為。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. And it had occurred because the Central Intelligence Agency, when it was created in 1947, was out of Section 5412, the 5412 committee was set up inside the National Security Council to actually oversee covert operations.
→ {"text": "這些事情之所以發生，是因為中央情報局（Central Intelligence Agency）於 1947 年成立時，根據第 5412 條款，在國家安全會議（National Security Council）內部設立了 5412 委員會，實際上負責監督秘密行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. For the first time, it actually legitimized the undertaking of covert operations that were not going to be revealed to the Congress.
→ {"text": "這首次使進行不向國會揭露的秘密行動變得合法化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. It was before we had an intelligence committee.
→ {"text": "這是在我們成立情報委員會之前。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. You remember that Prescott Bush, the United States Senator from Connecticut, was the one who would brief in certain Congress people and certain senators about this.
→ {"text": "各位記得，康乃狄克州參議員普雷斯科特·布希（Prescott Bush）是向特定國會議員與參議員簡報此事的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. So there was this entire kind of extra constitutional process or protocols that began to be undertaken right at the very beginning.
→ {"text": "因此，從一開始就存在著這整套超憲法程序或協議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

102. Finally, they set up the 5412 committee inside the National Security Council that oversaw those things.
→ {"text": "最終，他們在國家安全會議內部設立了 5412 委員會來監督這些事務。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. And as I said, I had never had access to that until we saw the Pentagon Papers, and on reviewing it with Neil Sheehan and the others, I came to the conclusion that all of this should be revealed, that these were criminal activities that had happened that were all happening outside of the United States, but they were having such dramatic effects inside the United States that I thought they ought to be talked about.
→ {"text": "如我所說，直到我們看到五角大樓文件之前，我從未接觸過這些資訊。在與尼爾·希恩（Neil Sheehan）及其他人審閱後，我得出結論：所有這些都應該被揭露，這些都是發生在美國境外的犯罪活動，但對美國境內產生了如此巨大的影響，我認為應該被討論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. But that was my first experience with this.
→ {"text": "但那是我第一次接觸這類事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. As it proceeded, I ended up becoming chief counsel in the Karen Silkwood case, the woman that was killed out in Oklahoma at the nuclear site out there.
→ {"text": "隨著事件發展，我最終成為凱倫·絲克伍案（Karen Silkwood case）的首席律師，她是在奧克拉荷馬州核設施遇害的女性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. And during our investigations of that, we discovered that 98 pounds of bomb-grade plutonium were being smuggled out of the Kerr-McGee nuclear facility, the reprocessing plant, and we discovered that it was actually being transported secretly to Israel.
→ {"text": "在調查過程中，我們發現 98 磅武器級鈽（bomb-grade plutonium）正從 Kerr-McGee 核設施的再處理廠被走私出去，我們發現這些材料實際上被秘密運往以色列。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

107. So I touched on that old third rail.
→ {"text": "所以我觸碰到了那條老禁忌（third rail）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

108. There it was, and we went and we briefed Peter Stockton.
→ {"text": "事實就在那裡，我們前往並向 Peter Stockton 簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

109. He was the chief investigator for John Dingell.
→ {"text": "他是 John Dingell 的首席調查員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. John Dingell was chairing the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, and because of the oversight of authority they had over nuclear facilities environmentally, we briefed them and told them all about this, and they actually set up a -- they tasked a real-time national security agency satellite to actually monitor the smuggling of these materials and actually track them onto being put on charter oil company ships and then boarded by Mossad and brought to Israel, and at that time they were under the condition that they had to share some of the special nuclear materials, 98 percent pure bomb-grade plutonium, that they had to share them with the Shah of Iran.
→ {"text": "John Dingell 當時擔任眾議院能源與環境小組委員會主席，由於他們對核設施擁有環境監督權，我們向他們簡報並告知所有情況。他們實際上部署了國家安全局（National Security Agency）的即時衛星來監控這些材料的走私活動，並實際追蹤到這些材料被裝上租賃的石油公司船隻，然後由摩薩德（Mossad）接收並運往以色列。當時他們的條件是必須分享部分特殊核材料——98% 純度的武器級鈽——必須與伊朗國王（Shah of Iran）分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. So that they actually were providing 98 percent pure bomb-grade plutonium, reprocessed plutonium to the Shah of Iran and to South Africa, the Afrikaner government.
→ {"text": "因此他們實際上向伊朗國王與南非的阿非利卡人（Afrikaner）政府提供了 98% 純度的武器級鈽、再處理鈽。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

112. Now because of my discovery of that, it was a clear absolute blatant violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and so I briefed the judge.
→ {"text": "由於我發現了這件事，這明顯是對《核武禁擴條約》（Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty）的公然且絕對的違反，因此我向法官簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. We had the Judge Theis, Frank G. Theis, was the chief counsel -- was the judge on that case.
→ {"text": "該案的法官是法蘭克·G·泰斯法官（Judge Frank G. Theis）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. I provided a memorandum to him, an affidavit to him explaining the whole thing, and the following Monday he contacted me and said the Central Intelligence Agency had contacted him and wanted to have an in-camera ex parte meeting with him, and he met with them and immediately dismissed one of the counts in our case, in the Karen Silkwood case, the whole -- her death on the highway.
→ {"text": "我向他提供了備忘錄與宣誓書，說明整件事情。隔週一他聯繫我，表示中央情報局（Central Intelligence Agency）已與他聯繫，要求與他進行秘密單方會議（in-camera ex parte meeting）。他與他們會面後，立即駁回了我們案件中的一項指控——凱倫·絲克伍案（Karen Silkwood case）中關於她在公路上死亡的整個指控。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. The whole interfering with her right to travel on the highway, her First Amendment right to meet with the New York Times, because David Burnham was waiting for her at the Holiday Inn to receive the documents showing that these -- it was 40 pounds, 98 percent pure platinum grade plutonium was missing.
→ {"text": "整個干涉她在公路上旅行的權利、她根據第一修正案（First Amendment）與《紐約時報》會面的權利——因為 David Burnham 正在 Holiday Inn 等她，準備接收顯示這些——40 磅 98% 純度鉑級鈽失蹤的文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. And when we gave that information to the congressman, nobody ever talked about it after that.
→ {"text": "當我們將該資訊提供給國會議員後，此後再也沒有人談論此事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. They called Stansfield Turner in, they brought him downstairs, put him under oath, challenged him about this, and the only reason I knew about it was because Peter Stockton told us about it.
→ {"text": "他們傳喚了斯坦斯菲爾德·特納（Stansfield Turner），將他帶到樓下，讓他宣誓，並就此事質問他。我之所以知道此事，唯一的原因是 Peter Stockton 告訴了我們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. So it became obvious again to me at that point that there were secrets that virtually everybody agreed within the political circles had to be kept secret, and this supplying -- our supplying in complete violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, 98 percent bomb grade plutonium to Israel was one of those things.
→ {"text": "所以在那時我再次明顯意識到，存在著一些政治圈內幾乎所有人都同意必須保密的秘密，而我們完全違反《核武禁擴條約》向以色列提供 98% 武器級鈽，就是其中之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

119. And so I realized that at that time there were these -- there was this dimension, such as Dr. Greer has talked about, there are levels of classification that are way beyond people in the congress, way beyond us as civilians, but I spent a lot of time looking into this whole process.
→ {"text": "因此我意識到，當時存在著這些——如 Dr. Greer 所談論的那樣——存在著遠遠超出國會人士、遠遠超出我們這些平民的機密等級。但我花了很多時間研究整個過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. And as you know, I was the one that filed the original Iran-Contra case that got the special prosecutor appointed.
→ {"text": "如各位所知，我是提起原始伊朗門案件（Iran-Contra case）並促成特別檢察官任命的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. We uncovered all the smuggling of the weapons that were going on, the cocaine smuggling operations that were going on.
→ {"text": "我們揭露了所有正在進行的武器走私、古柯鹼走私行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. It became clear to me that everybody knew about this, that all kinds of people knew about this going on, but the citizens didn't.
→ {"text": "我清楚地意識到，所有人都知道這件事，各種各樣的人都知道這些事情正在發生，但公民不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. And as I tried to bring information to some people in congress and the senate, et cetera, talked with Tip O'Neill about all of this, and we -- as I discovered all this stuff was going on, I was then later contacted by Dr. John Mack, as I told you, to represent him, and I was aware of the fact that there was this realm of ultimate secrecy that existed.
→ {"text": "當我試圖將資訊帶給國會與參議院的一些人士，與 Tip O'Neill 討論所有這些事情時——當我發現所有這些事情正在發生時——如我所說，後來 Dr. John Mack 聯繫我代表他，而我意識到存在著終極保密領域（realm of ultimate secrecy）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. But I realized that there was a classification above everything that I'd ever seen that was cosmic, a cosmic top secret.
→ {"text": "但我意識到，存在著一個高於我見過的一切的機密等級，那就是宇宙級的，宇宙最高機密（cosmic top secret）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

125. There's a whole category of cosmic top secret that has to do with this particular category, and that there's information in there about contacts with these beings that were recovered from Roswell, a living being, one particular living being that they brought to Wright-Patterson, that they didn't know what to do with the being, they didn't know how to take care of the being, they had to keep the being isolated, but they were afraid of potential contamination.
→ {"text": "有一整個宇宙最高機密類別與這個特定類別有關，其中包含關於與這些從羅斯威爾（Roswell）回收的存有（beings）接觸的資訊——一個活的存有，他們將其中一個特定的活體存有帶到萊特-帕特森（Wright-Patterson），他們不知道該如何處理這個存有，不知道如何照顧這個存有，他們必須將其隔離，但又害怕潛在的污染。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. And I was challenged at that point to try to determine whether or not I would reveal these things to everyone.
→ {"text": "在那個時候，我面臨挑戰，必須決定是否要向所有人揭露這些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. I kept trying to have contact with people inside the intelligence community to say look, if there's something that you think I ought to know that would convince me that the American people somehow shouldn't know about this, tell me about it, will you?
→ {"text": "我一直試圖與情報界內部的人士聯繫，對他們說：聽著，如果你們認為有什麼我應該知道的事情，能夠說服我美國人民不應該知道這些，請告訴我好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. Because if you're not going to tell me about it, I can tell you I'm going after it, and I'm going to be going after it in a context that may make it automatically available to anybody once I get it.
→ {"text": "因為如果你們不告訴我，我可以告訴你們我會追查下去，而且我會在一個可能使任何人一旦我取得它就能自動獲取的環境中追查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. And only a couple of times have I ever approached and said to stay away from these things.
→ {"text": "只有幾次有人接觸我並告訴我遠離這些事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. Well that's not an answer, just to stay away from it.
→ {"text": "嗯，那不是答案，只是要我遠離而已。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. And so what I've done is I'm just coming to you today to tell you that with my experience directly as one of the attorneys in the Pentagon Papers case, I was in F. Lee Bailey's office when we did the Watergate burglary.
→ {"text": "所以我今天來到這裡，是要告訴你們，憑藉我作為五角大樓文件案（Pentagon Papers case）律師之一的直接經驗——我在處理水門案竊案時身處 F. Lee Bailey 的辦公室。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. It was our office that got McCord to write the letter to Judge Sirica, blowing the whistle on the Watergate plumbers, the Karen Silkwood case with the smuggling of the plutonium, the Iran-Contra case with all of the smuggling of cocaine that was going on.
→ {"text": "正是我們的辦公室讓 McCord 寫信給 Sirica 法官，揭發水門竊聽者（Watergate plumbers）；凱倫·絲克伍案（Karen Silkwood case）涉及鈽走私；伊朗門案（Iran-Contra case）涉及所有正在進行的古柯鹼走私。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. But nothing matches this issue.
→ {"text": "但沒有什麼能與這個議題相提並論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. Nothing comes close to matching this issue.
→ {"text": "沒有任何事情能接近這個議題的重要性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. Because the reality of it is, is that because whatever this extraterrestrial intelligence is, they obviously share the belief that somehow we shouldn't be just told right straight outright.
→ {"text": "因為事實是，無論這個外星智慧（extraterrestrial intelligence）是什麼，他們顯然也認為我們不應該被直接明確地告知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. As people have said, why don't they land on the White House lawn and just tell us?
→ {"text": "正如人們所說，為什麼他們不降落在白宮草坪上直接告訴我們？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. So there is obviously some type of consensus that exists at the highest levels of the security, cosmic, top-secret clearance in our government.
→ {"text": "因此顯然在我們政府的最高安全層級——宇宙最高機密許可（cosmic top-secret clearance）——存在著某種共識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. And when I asked Gorbachev about this, because I was legal counsel to the State of the World Forum for Gorbachev and Senator Baker at the end of the Cold War, he told me flat out that these things existed and that they'd known that these existed and they were in communication with the United States government about this.
→ {"text": "當我向戈巴契夫（Gorbachev）詢問此事時——因為我在冷戰結束時擔任戈巴契夫與參議員貝克（Senator Baker）的「世界論壇」（State of the World Forum）法律顧問——他直截了當地告訴我，這些事情存在，他們知道這些存在，並且他們正在就此與美國政府溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. So what I'm saying is that we need to as citizens be insistent upon finding out about this unless and until somebody communicates information to us that makes sense as to why it is that people all shouldn't know about this.
→ {"text": "所以我要說的是，作為公民，我們需要堅持查明此事，除非且直到有人向我們傳達有意義的資訊，解釋為什麼所有人不應該知道這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. And they haven't told me that yet, and so until they do, I'm going to continue to try to find out everything I can about it and share it with people who've had the kind of responsible positions that you have had in your lives and still have in your lives.
→ {"text": "他們還沒有告訴我，所以在他們告訴我之前，我將繼續盡力查明一切，並與那些像你們一樣曾經擔任或仍在擔任負責任職位的人分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

141. Because the reality is you still have political capital, whether you're 87 years old or 39 years old or whatever your ages are now, that you still have political capital that can effectuate a change and that for you to go collectively to sit down with certain members of Congress or certain people together to say, "Look, this is what we know and we want to act responsibly.
→ {"text": "因為事實是，無論你們現在是 87 歲、39 歲還是其他年齡，你們仍然擁有政治資本，能夠促成改變。你們可以集體與特定國會議員或特定人士坐下來說：「聽著，這是我們所知道的，我們想要負責任地行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. Can you please help us act responsibly, but we're going to act in any event?"
→ {"text": "你們能幫助我們負責任地行動嗎？但無論如何我們都會行動。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. And that's how you will find out, I believe.
→ {"text": "我相信，這就是你們將會查明真相的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. Mr. Cameron.
→ {"text": "Cameron 先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
