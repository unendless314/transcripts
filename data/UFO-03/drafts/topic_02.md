## Speaker Group 1

85. Daniel.

86. I'd like to address the issue from the point of view of a practicing attorney in these particular areas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. I just touched on it briefly earlier in the other panel that when I was at the Cahill Gordon law firm in New York, we were brought the Pentagon Papers at that time, and Jim Goodell, the chief counsel for the New York Times contacted us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. I had been working on the briefs for the New York Times because I happened to have initiated the case that established the right of journalists to protect their confidential news sources when I was at the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. So I was at the firm and was working on the briefs, and Jim Goodell brought us the information that they had the Pentagon Papers, and so it was the first time that I found myself in a situation where I had to kind of try to put myself in the shoes of people that I had the luxury prior to that time of just saying, "We ought to get it all out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. We ought to just reveal everything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. We ought to tell all the people have a right to know everything."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. And I found myself in this peculiar situation of starting to ask questions about what might be in there that we had to try to be careful about revealing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. Now in that particular case, it wasn't a hard question because we found things about the assassination program of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Phoenix program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. We found out that they were smuggling opium in Southeast Asia to help fund it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. We found out about the Nugan Hand Bank that was set up by Theodore Shackley, who was the CIA station chief in Saigon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. All the things that we found out about in that particular instance I felt were criminal conduct, unlawful conduct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. And it had occurred because the Central Intelligence Agency, when it was created in 1947, was out of Section 5412, the 5412 committee was set up inside the National Security Council to actually oversee covert operations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. For the first time, it actually legitimized the undertaking of covert operations that were not going to be revealed to the Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. It was before we had an intelligence committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. You remember that Prescott Bush, the United States Senator from Connecticut, was the one who would brief in certain Congress people and certain senators about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. So there was this entire kind of extra constitutional process or protocols that began to be undertaken right at the very beginning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. Finally, they set up the 5412 committee inside the National Security Council that oversaw those things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. And as I said, I had never had access to that until we saw the Pentagon Papers, and on reviewing it with Neil Sheehan and the others, I came to the conclusion that all of this should be revealed, that these were criminal activities that had happened that were all happening outside of the United States, but they were having such dramatic effects inside the United States that I thought they ought to be talked about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. But that was my first experience with this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. As it proceeded, I ended up becoming chief counsel in the Karen Silkwood case, the woman that was killed out in Oklahoma at the nuclear site out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. And during our investigations of that, we discovered that 98 pounds of bomb-grade plutonium were being smuggled out of the Kerr-McGee nuclear facility, the reprocessing plant, and we discovered that it was actually being transported secretly to Israel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. So I touched on that old third rail.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. There it was, and we went and we briefed Peter Stockton.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. He was the chief investigator for John Dingell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. John Dingell was chairing the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, and because of the oversight of authority they had over nuclear facilities environmentally, we briefed them and told them all about this, and they actually set up a -- they tasked a real-time national security agency satellite to actually monitor the smuggling of these materials and actually track them onto being put on charter oil company ships and then boarded by Mossad and brought to Israel, and at that time they were under the condition that they had to share some of the special nuclear materials, 98 percent pure bomb-grade plutonium, that they had to share them with the Shah of Iran.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. So that they actually were providing 98 percent pure bomb-grade plutonium, reprocessed plutonium to the Shah of Iran and to South Africa, the Afrikaner government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. Now because of my discovery of that, it was a clear absolute blatant violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and so I briefed the judge.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. We had the Judge Theis, Frank G. Theis, was the chief counsel -- was the judge on that case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. I provided a memorandum to him, an affidavit to him explaining the whole thing, and the following Monday he contacted me and said the Central Intelligence Agency had contacted him and wanted to have an in-camera ex parte meeting with him, and he met with them and immediately dismissed one of the counts in our case, in the Karen Silkwood case, the whole -- her death on the highway.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. The whole interfering with her right to travel on the highway, her First Amendment right to meet with the New York Times, because David Burnham was waiting for her at the Holiday Inn to receive the documents showing that these -- it was 40 pounds, 98 percent pure platinum grade plutonium was missing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. And when we gave that information to the congressman, nobody ever talked about it after that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. They called Stansfield Turner in, they brought him downstairs, put him under oath, challenged him about this, and the only reason I knew about it was because Peter Stockton told us about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. So it became obvious again to me at that point that there were secrets that virtually everybody agreed within the political circles had to be kept secret, and this supplying -- our supplying in complete violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, 98 percent bomb grade plutonium to Israel was one of those things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. And so I realized that at that time there were these -- there was this dimension, such as Dr. Greer has talked about, there are levels of classification that are way beyond people in the congress, way beyond us as civilians, but I spent a lot of time looking into this whole process.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. And as you know, I was the one that filed the original Iran-Contra case that got the special prosecutor appointed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. We uncovered all the smuggling of the weapons that were going on, the cocaine smuggling operations that were going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. It became clear to me that everybody knew about this, that all kinds of people knew about this going on, but the citizens didn't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. And as I tried to bring information to some people in congress and the senate, et cetera, talked with Tip O'Neill about all of this, and we -- as I discovered all this stuff was going on, I was then later contacted by Dr. John Mack, as I told you, to represent him, and I was aware of the fact that there was this realm of ultimate secrecy that existed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. But I realized that there was a classification above everything that I'd ever seen that was cosmic, a cosmic top secret.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. There's a whole category of cosmic top secret that has to do with this particular category, and that there's information in there about contacts with these beings that were recovered from Roswell, a living being, one particular living being that they brought to Wright-Patterson, that they didn't know what to do with the being, they didn't know how to take care of the being, they had to keep the being isolated, but they were afraid of potential contamination.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. And I was challenged at that point to try to determine whether or not I would reveal these things to everyone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. I kept trying to have contact with people inside the intelligence community to say look, if there's something that you think I ought to know that would convince me that the American people somehow shouldn't know about this, tell me about it, will you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. Because if you're not going to tell me about it, I can tell you I'm going after it, and I'm going to be going after it in a context that may make it automatically available to anybody once I get it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. And only a couple of times have I ever approached and said to stay away from these things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. Well that's not an answer, just to stay away from it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. And so what I've done is I'm just coming to you today to tell you that with my experience directly as one of the attorneys in the Pentagon Papers case, I was in F. Lee Bailey's office when we did the Watergate burglary.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. It was our office that got McCord to write the letter to Judge Sirica, blowing the whistle on the Watergate plumbers, the Karen Silkwood case with the smuggling of the plutonium, the Iran-Contra case with all of the smuggling of cocaine that was going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. But nothing matches this issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. Nothing comes close to matching this issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. Because the reality of it is, is that because whatever this extraterrestrial intelligence is, they obviously share the belief that somehow we shouldn't be just told right straight outright.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. As people have said, why don't they land on the White House lawn and just tell us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. So there is obviously some type of consensus that exists at the highest levels of the security, cosmic, top-secret clearance in our government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. And when I asked Gorbachev about this, because I was legal counsel to the State of the World Forum for Gorbachev and Senator Baker at the end of the Cold War, he told me flat out that these things existed and that they'd known that these existed and they were in communication with the United States government about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. So what I'm saying is that we need to as citizens be insistent upon finding out about this unless and until somebody communicates information to us that makes sense as to why it is that people all shouldn't know about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. And they haven't told me that yet, and so until they do, I'm going to continue to try to find out everything I can about it and share it with people who've had the kind of responsible positions that you have had in your lives and still have in your lives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. Because the reality is you still have political capital, whether you're 87 years old or 39 years old or whatever your ages are now, that you still have political capital that can effectuate a change and that for you to go collectively to sit down with certain members of Congress or certain people together to say, "Look, this is what we know and we want to act responsibly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. Can you please help us act responsibly, but we're going to act in any event?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. And that's how you will find out, I believe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Mr. Cameron.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
