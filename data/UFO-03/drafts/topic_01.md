6. It's an honor to be here.
→ {"text": "能夠來到此處是我的榮幸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. And I would just like to summarize this subject by saying that I got involved in 1990 when I formed the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and put together some of the early briefings for folks in the administration of President Clinton.
→ {"text": "我想簡要說明本議題：我於 1990 年投入此領域，當時成立了外星智慧研究中心（Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence），並為柯林頓總統（President Clinton）政府的相關人員準備了早期的簡報資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. This occurred because in 1992 I was leading a team of people where we had a contact event on a beach in Florida.
→ {"text": "事情源於 1992 年，當時我率領一支團隊在佛羅里達州的海灘上經歷了一次接觸事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. And this got reported into a Department of Defense memo or report that was done by John Peterson at the Arlington Institute.
→ {"text": "此事被記錄於一份國防部備忘錄或報告中，該文件由 Arlington Institute 的 John Peterson 撰寫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. And he was friends with the man who became CIA Director Woolsey.
→ {"text": "他與後來成為 CIA 局長的 Woolsey 是朋友。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. CIA Director Woolsey invited us to come to Washington to meet with him and some folks to discuss this.
→ {"text": "CIA 局長 Woolsey 邀請我們前往華盛頓與他及一些人士會面討論此事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. And it was to my great surprise and dismay to learn that the CIA Director had made inquiries into this subject and had not gotten any information.
→ {"text": "令我極為驚訝與失望的是，我得知這位 CIA 局長曾就此議題進行調查，卻未獲得任何資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. This was also true of President Clinton who, through Webster Hubbell, had also made inquiries.
→ {"text": "柯林頓總統（President Clinton）也是如此，他曾透過韋伯斯特·哈貝爾（Webster Hubbell）進行調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. Because of this, we decided to put together an initiative which was called Project Starlight and it was very much involved in the early days with briefing senior people in the military and government.
→ {"text": "因此，我們決定發起一項名為「星光計畫」（Project Starlight）的倡議，早期主要向軍方與政府的高層人士進行簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. And to my dismay, I have to say at this point that we discovered that there was an extra constitutional management of this subject, which continues to this moment, which I find, as Eisenhower said, an existential threat to our democracy.
→ {"text": "令我遺憾的是，我必須指出，我們發現此議題存在著超憲法管理（extra-constitutional management）的情形，至今依然如此，正如艾森豪所言，這對我們的民主構成存亡威脅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. It's for that reason, a few years ago I left my medical career to pursue this and to get the truth out to the public because I feel it's a matter of very pressing concern.
→ {"text": "正因如此，幾年前我離開了醫療職業生涯，全心投入此事並將真相公諸於世，因為我認為這是極為迫切的議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. I'm an emergency doctor and I always kind of halfway jokingly say I know an emergency when I see one and our planet and our government is in an emergency.
→ {"text": "我是一名急診醫師，我總是半開玩笑地說，我看得出緊急狀況，而我們的星球與政府正處於緊急狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. During the period around the time we had our meetings with Mr. Rockefeller, I had already set up briefings through the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Wilson, meeting at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to which the remains of the Roswell event was sent.
→ {"text": "在我們與 Rockefeller 先生會面的那段期間，我已透過參謀長聯席會議情報主管威爾森上將（Admiral Wilson）安排了簡報，會面地點在萊特-帕特森空軍基地（Wright-Patterson Air Force Base），羅斯威爾事件（Roswell event）的殘骸曾被送往該處。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. They initially did not want to have this meeting.
→ {"text": "他們起初不願舉行此會議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. It was ordered by the head of Air Force intelligence under the orders of J2, which as you know is head of intelligence, joint staff, Admiral Kramer.
→ {"text": "此會議是由空軍情報主管在 J2（如各位所知，J2 是聯合參謀部情報主管）的命令下安排，即克拉默上將（Admiral Kramer）。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "topics.json 建議此處的 Admiral Kramer 可能是 Admiral Wilson 的誤聽"}

21. That then led to a series of events where we decided what we needed to do was pull together the best military, intelligence, and corporate, Lockheed, Northrop, and other witnesses as we call them, to this issue and begin to do briefings for various members of Congress and people in the administration.
→ {"text": "這促成了一系列後續事件，我們決定集結最優秀的軍方、情報界與企業界人士——包括 Lockheed、Northrop 等公司的證人——並開始向國會議員及政府人士進行簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. In 1995, I organized, and Mr. Rockefeller funded, a gathering of the first of witnesses at Asilomar near Monterey in California.
→ {"text": "1995 年，我組織了首次證人聚會，由 Rockefeller 先生資助，地點在加州蒙特雷附近的 Asilomar。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. These were people, they were cosmonauts, they were from Russia, they were astronauts such as Edgar Mitchell, they were people who had worked with Eisenhower and knew of Eisenhower's concern that he had lost control over the secrecy on this issue around 1956.
→ {"text": "這些人包括太空人、俄羅斯太空員、Edgar Mitchell 這樣的太空人，以及曾與艾森豪共事的人士，他們知道艾森豪曾擔憂在 1956 年左右失去了對此議題保密工作的控制權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. Then ironically, the Rockefeller commission reorganized the Department of Defense and the CIA into such a Byzantine mess that to this day these projects have not had proper oversight at that level.
→ {"text": "諷刺的是，洛克菲勒委員會（Rockefeller commission）將國防部與 CIA 重組成極為複雜的體系，以至於這些計畫至今都未能在該層級獲得適當監督。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. This then led to us doing some meetings for members of Congress.
→ {"text": "這促使我們為國會議員安排了一些會議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. We did in 1997, and Congressman Dan Burton, who was chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee came, along with a number of other congressmen and senators, and also following that, we did what's called a stand-up briefing, Edgar Mitchell and I did, the Sixth Man to Walk on the Moon, with some of our military sources for then head of intelligence joint staff, Admiral Tom Wilson.
→ {"text": "我們於 1997 年舉行了會議，眾議院政府監督委員會主席 Dan Burton 眾議員與其他多位國會議員及參議員出席。隨後，我與第六位登月太空人 Edgar Mitchell 一同為當時的聯合參謀部情報主管湯姆·威爾森上將（Admiral Tom Wilson）進行了所謂的立式簡報，並提供了我們的軍方消息來源。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. To my astonishment, when I had this meeting, I had sent in advance a briefing similar to the one that I provided here, this is the one I provided for President Obama.
→ {"text": "令我驚訝的是，在這次會議之前，我事先寄送了一份類似於此處提供的簡報，這也是我提供給歐巴馬總統（President Obama）的版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. What I was astonished and appalled to learn is that the first document that I have in this document is a National Reconnaissance Office document that has actionable intelligence listing project code names and code numbers, effective as of the early '90s.
→ {"text": "令我震驚與憤慨的是，該文件中的第一份文件是一份國家偵察辦公室（National Reconnaissance Office）的文件，包含可採取行動的情報，列出了截至 1990 年代初期仍有效的計畫代號與代碼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. This Admiral, Tom Wilson, looked through this document, identified one of the compartments, contacted them and was told, and I'm quoting, "Sir, you do not have a need to know."
→ {"text": "這位湯姆·威爾森上將（Admiral Tom Wilson）翻閱了這份文件，確認了其中一個機密區間（compartment），聯繫了該單位，卻被告知——我引述原話——「長官，您沒有知曉的必要性。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. This is the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he said to the person, it was a contractor, I cannot disclose which one, he said that basically, "Sir, we will not discuss this with you further," and basically hung up on the Admiral.
→ {"text": "這可是參謀長聯席會議的情報主管，而對方——一名承包商，我不能透露是哪一家——基本上對他說：「長官，我們不會與您進一步討論此事」，然後就掛斷了上將的電話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. Because of that event, we then wrote a unless otherwise directed letter.
→ {"text": "由於此事件，我們隨後撰寫了一封「除非另有指示」信函（Unless Otherwise Directed letter，UNOD）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. My military advisor said, "Dr. Greer, what you need to do is do a UNOD letter that goes to all branches of government that says that we have concluded that this subject is being managed in an extra-constitutional fashion.
→ {"text": "我的軍方顧問說：「Dr. Greer，您需要撰寫一封 UNOD 信函送交政府各部門，聲明我們已得出結論：此議題正以超憲法方式進行管理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. A priori, the National Security Act no longer applies to those under those, and they are hereby exonerated or freed from them."
→ {"text": "因此，《國家安全法》（National Security Act）不再適用於受該法約束之人士，他們在此被免除或解除該義務。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. We wrote such a letter to the heads of all agencies.
→ {"text": "我們向所有機構的負責人撰寫了這樣一封信函。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. It was never contested, and the way unless otherwise directed letter works is that unless you hear back from the agency, you are allowed to proceed with your assessment, and our assessment was that we were going to go forward with these men and women and documents.
→ {"text": "該信函從未遭到質疑。「除非另有指示」信函的運作方式是：除非收到機構的回覆，否則您可以按照自己的評估行事，而我們的評估是將與這些男女證人及文件繼續推進。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. In fact, there was a senior CIA official who I have been asked not to name who is still in the science directorate of the CIA who said, "Please do this for our nation."
→ {"text": "事實上，有一位 CIA 高階官員——我被要求不要透露其姓名，他仍在 CIA 科學部門任職——對我說：「請為了我們的國家這麼做。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. At that point, we began to gather together more of these so-called witnesses.
→ {"text": "在那個時候，我們開始集結更多這些所謂的證人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. They've been called now.
→ {"text": "他們現在已經被稱為證人。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語意略顯簡短，可能指「現在大家這樣稱呼他們」"}

39. I call them patriots who want to have the truth out.
→ {"text": "我稱他們為愛國者，希望將真相揭露的愛國者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. We then did the 2001 disclosure project in this ballroom, and we're about at our 12-year anniversary of that, and I organized that for the purpose of getting the public informed and also Congress.
→ {"text": "隨後我們於 2001 年在這間會議廳舉辦了揭露計畫（Disclosure Project），現在大約是 12 週年紀念。我組織該活動的目的是讓公眾與國會知情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. There were tens of thousands of petitions sent to members of Congress in faxes asking for hearings.
→ {"text": "數以萬計的請願書透過傳真送交國會議員，要求舉行聽證會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. Unfortunately, a few months later, 9/11 happened.
→ {"text": "不幸的是，幾個月後發生了 9/11 事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. The day before 9/11, September 10th, that there was a memo from a comment, I should say, in a speech by then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld who stated that there is $2.3 trillion unaccounted for in the Department of Defense budget.
→ {"text": "在 9/11 的前一天，也就是 9 月 10 日，時任國防部長倫斯斐（Rumsfeld）在一次演講中發表評論——應該說是一份備忘錄——指出國防部預算中有 2.3 兆美元下落不明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. Let me repeat that number, $2.3 trillion.
→ {"text": "讓我重複這個數字：2.3 兆美元。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. This was on September 10th, 2001.
→ {"text": "這是在 2001 年 9 月 10 日。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. Now, prior to that, I was not surprised at that comment because back in 1994, I had a meeting with Mr. DeMato, not the senator, who was the chief counsel for the Senate Appropriations Committee, and he informed me that they felt that there was upwards of or in excess of $900 billion a year missing out of the Treasury going into so-called black projects.
→ {"text": "在此之前，我對這番評論並不驚訝，因為早在 1994 年，我曾與參議院撥款委員會（Senate Appropriations Committee）首席法律顧問 DeMato 先生（不是參議員）會面，他告知我，他們認為每年有高達或超過 9，000 億美元從財政部流失，流向所謂的黑計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. Now, this is a misnomer, just so that the committee knows, the proper term in the military and intelligence world is an unacknowledged special access project.
→ {"text": "現在，我要說明的是，這其實是用詞不當。讓委員會知道，在軍方與情報界的正確術語是「未公開特別許可項目」（Unacknowledged Special Access Project）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. Now, special access projects are projects that, of course, you have to be read into with various clearances.
→ {"text": "當然，特別許可項目（Special Access Project）是指您必須透過各種許可才能獲准接觸的計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. The unacknowledged ones are ones for which there is no acknowledgment on paper, and anyone in the project is ordered not to speak about it under threat of termination with extreme prejudice, which is death.
→ {"text": "而未公開的項目則是指紙面上沒有任何確認記錄，任何參與計畫的人員都被命令不得談論，違者將面臨「極端偏見終結」（termination with extreme prejudice）的威脅，也就是處決。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. My senior military advisor was in one such project.
→ {"text": "我的資深軍方顧問曾參與過這樣一個計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. He has not even informed me what it concerned.
→ {"text": "他甚至沒有告訴我該計畫涉及什麼內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. It was under Admiral Harry Train.

54. This is one project that was unacknowledged.
→ {"text": "這是一個未公開的項目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. So this is not a theory.

56. This is how the deep national security state actually operates that the members of Congress usually are not aware of.
→ {"text": "這就是深層國家安全體系實際運作的方式，而國會議員通常並不知情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. Now, in the ensuing year, since 2001, we have continued these briefings.
→ {"text": "自 2001 年以來，我們持續進行這些簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. We've had greater success in other countries.

59. There are now more than 14 countries that have opened their UFO files.

60. We've been very instrumental in this.
→ {"text": "我們在此過程中發揮了關鍵作用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. I've worked with people at the Vatican, the French government, and what is also very exciting is that one of the most important documents in history, which I'll provide to the committee, is a document from the Ministry of Defense of France committing to my organization to engage in a long-term project to make peaceful contact with these "visitors."
→ {"text": "我曾與梵蒂岡及法國政府的人士合作，而令人振奮的是，我將向委員會提供歷史上最重要的文件之一——來自法國國防部的文件，承諾與我的組織合作進行長期計畫，與這些「訪客」建立和平接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. This document has not been yet released.
→ {"text": "這份文件尚未公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. I will provide it to the committee, and there is great progress being made in other countries.
→ {"text": "我將把它提供給委員會，其他國家也正在取得重大進展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. Admiral Moran, who won the Ampere Prize in France and is an MD, as I am, and also a PhD physicist, and has been an advisor and was an advisor to President Sarkozy and others, has been meeting with us and we have been involved with projects in other countries to do this.
→ {"text": "莫蘭上將（Admiral Moran）曾榮獲法國安培獎（Ampere Prize），他跟我一樣是醫學博士，同時也是物理學博士，曾擔任薩科齊總統（President Sarkozy）等人的顧問，他一直與我們會面，我們也參與了其他國家的相關計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. I will tell you, however, that as they began to step into this, they were warned off by someone within the national security state saying, "Do not pursue this."
→ {"text": "然而我必須告訴你們，當他們開始涉足此事時，曾被國家安全體系內部的某人警告：「不要追查此事。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. We went to France about two years, three years ago, and we had an expedition to actually make contact with these extraterrestrial civilizations.
→ {"text": "大約兩、三年前，我們前往法國進行一次實際與這些外星文明接觸的探險。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. The admiral later informed us that their radar tracked objects that came over the site at between 100,000 and 200,000 kilometers an hour.
→ {"text": "上將後來告知我們，他們的雷達追蹤到飛越該地點的物體，速度在每小時 10 萬至 20 萬公里之間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. Now, what is fascinating about this is that the French were not deterred from doing this project with us, but they have to date remained fairly quiet.
→ {"text": "令人著迷的是，法國並未因此卻步，仍與我們合作進行此計畫，但至今仍保持相當低調。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. There is, therefore, progress being made in other G7 countries.
→ {"text": "因此，其他 G7 國家正在取得進展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

70. As you know, we have a former Minister of Defense of Canada here who is very supportive, the Honorable Paul Hellyer, and what we find, however, is that the United States has remained a black hole of secrecy.
→ {"text": "如各位所知，加拿大前國防部長保羅·赫勒閣下（Honorable Paul Hellyer）在此提供了大力支持。然而我們發現，美國仍然是保密的黑洞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. Now, the reason for this is complex.
→ {"text": "其原因錯綜複雜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

72. One of the reasons is inertia.
→ {"text": "原因之一是慣性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. Once you go into an unacknowledged special access project, it's very hard to bring things out.
→ {"text": "一旦進入未公開特別許可項目，就很難將事物揭露出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. Number two is that this is the crown jewel in America of the defense industry and the aerospace industry.

76. He worked on the lunar module, which is part of how I got involved with this.
→ {"text": "他參與了登月艙的工作，這也是我涉足此領域的部分原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. What I have found through my uncle and other contacts at Lockheed is that we have had since about the mid-1950s operational electromagnetic-gravitic devices, basically in parlance of the pop culture anti-gravity devices, that are deeply classified and are the next generation beyond rockets and jet aircraft.
→ {"text": "透過我叔叔及 Lockheed 的其他聯絡人，我發現自 1950 年代中期左右，我們就已擁有可運作的電磁-重力裝置，用流行文化的說法就是反重力裝置，這些裝置被深度機密化，是超越火箭與噴射機的下一代技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. These are fully operational and not experimental.

79. These have been used very discreetly.

80. We have an enormous amount of information on this, including a facility, Norton Air Force Base, where we had Frank Carlucci, the Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan, was ushered in there, and some people who were with him, such as Brad Sorensen, have given us information and actually have helped us provide schematics and drawings for these so-called alien reproduction vehicles, a bit of a misnomer because in reality advanced anti-gravity research began with T. Townsend Brown in 1929.
→ {"text": "我們掌握了大量相關資訊，包括一處設施——諾頓空軍基地（Norton Air Force Base）——雷根總統的國防部長法蘭克·卡魯奇（Frank Carlucci）曾被帶至該處，與他同行的人士如 Brad Sorensen 向我們提供了資訊，並協助我們取得這些所謂「仿製外星載具」（alien reproduction vehicles）的原理圖與設計圖。這個名稱其實有些不當，因為先進反重力研究實際上始於托馬斯·湯森·布朗（T. Townsend Brown）在 1929 年的研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

81. We will get more into this on Friday.
→ {"text": "我們將在週五深入探討此事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. The key point here is that the technologies that would give us a new civilization without oil, without gas, without coal, without nuclear power are extant.
→ {"text": "關鍵在於，能夠讓我們建立不依賴石油、天然氣、煤炭與核能的新文明的技術，已經存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. They already exist, they've been developed, and it is a matter of the utmost national security and world peace and justice that we bring these sciences out and start a new chapter in the human experience.
→ {"text": "這些技術已經存在且已開發完成，將這些科學成果公諸於世並開啟人類經驗的新篇章，是攸關國家安全、世界和平與正義的頭等大事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. Thank you.
