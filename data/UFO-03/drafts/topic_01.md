## Speaker Group 1

1. And we'll begin with the two witnesses that are here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

2. If you would be so kind as to repeat after me, I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth to the members of this committee today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

3. Thank you both.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

4. And we're going to begin with Dr. Greer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

5. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

6. It's an honor to be here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

7. And I would just like to summarize this subject by saying that I got involved in 1990 when I formed the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and put together some of the early briefings for folks in the administration of President Clinton.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

8. This occurred because in 1992 I was leading a team of people where we had a contact event on a beach in Florida.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. And this got reported into a Department of Defense memo or report that was done by John Peterson at the Arlington Institute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. And he was friends with the man who became CIA Director Woolsey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. CI Director Woolsey invited us to come to Washington to meet with him and some folks to discuss this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. And it was to my great surprise and dismay to learn that the CI Director had made inquiries into this subject and had not gotten any information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. This was also true of President Clinton who, through Webster Hubbell, had also made inquiries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. Because of this, we decided to put together an initiative which was called Project Starlight and it was very much involved in the early days with briefing senior people in the military and government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. And to my dismay, I have to say at this point that we discovered that there was an extra constitutional management of this subject, which continues to this moment, which I find, as Eisenhower said, an existential threat to our democracy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. It's for that reason, a few years ago I left my medical career to pursue this and to get the truth out to the public because I feel it's a matter of very pressing concern.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. I'm an emergency doctor and I always kind of halfway jokingly say I know an emergency when I see one and our planet and our government is in an emergency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. During the period around the time we had our meetings with Mr. Rockefeller, I had already set up briefings through the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Wilson, meeting at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to which the remains of the Roswell event was sent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. They initially did not want to have this meeting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. It was ordered by the head of Air Force intelligence under the orders of J2, which as you know is head of intelligence, joint staff, Admiral Kramer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. That then led to a series of events where we decided what we needed to do was pull together the best military, intelligence, and corporate, Lockheed, Northrop, and other witnesses as we call them, to this issue and begin to do briefings for various members of Congress and people in the administration.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. In 1995, I organized, and Mr. Rockefeller funded, a gathering of the first of witnesses at Asilomar near Monterey in California.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. These were people, they were cosmonauts, they were from Russia, they were astronauts such as Edgar Mitchell, they were people who had worked with Eisenhower and knew of Eisenhower's concern that he had lost control over the secrecy on this issue around 1956.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. Then ironically, the Rockefeller commission reorganized the Department of Defense and the CIA into such a Byzantine mess that to this day these projects have not had proper oversight at that level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. This then led to us doing some meetings for members of Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. We did in 1997, and Congressman Dan Burton, who was chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee came, along with a number of other congressmen and senators, and also following that, we did what's called a stand-up briefing, Edgar Mitchell and I did, the Sixth Man to Walk on the Moon, with some of our military sources for then head of intelligence joint staff, Admiral Tom Wilson.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. To my astonishment, when I had this meeting, I had sent in advance a briefing similar to the one that I provided here, this is the one I provided for President Obama.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. What I was astonished and appalled to learn is that the first document that I have in this document is a National Reconnaissance Office document that has actionable intelligence listing project code names and code numbers, effective as of the early '90s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. This Admiral, Tom Wilson, looked through this document, identified one of the compartments, contacted them and was told, and I'm quoting, "Sir, you do not have a need to know."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. This is the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he said to the person, it was a contractor, I cannot disclose which one, he said that basically, "Sir, we will not discuss this with you further," and basically hung up on the Admiral.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. Because of that event, we then wrote a unless otherwise directed letter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. My military advisor said, "Dr. Greer, what you need to do is do a UNOD letter that goes to all branches of government that says that we have concluded that this subject is being managed in an extra-constitutional fashion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. A priori, the National Security Act no longer applies to those under those, and they are hereby exonerated or freed from them."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. We wrote such a letter to the heads of all agencies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. It was never contested, and the way unless otherwise directed letter works is that unless you hear back from the agency, you are allowed to proceed with your assessment, and our assessment was that we were going to go forward with these men and women and documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. In fact, there was a senior CIA official who I have been asked not to name who is still in the science directorate of the CIA who said, "Please do this for our nation."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. At that point, we began to gather together more of these so-called witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. They've been called now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. I call them patriots who want to have the truth out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. We then did the 2001 disclosure project in this ballroom, and we're about at our 12-year anniversary of that, and I organized that for the purpose of getting the public informed and also Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. There were tens of thousands of petitions sent to members of Congress in faxes asking for hearings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. Unfortunately, a few months later, 9/11 happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. The day before 9/11, September 10th, that there was a memo from a comment, I should say, in a speech by then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld who stated that there is $2.3 trillion unaccounted for in the Department of Defense budget.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. Let me repeat that number, $2.3 trillion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. This was on September 10th, 2001.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. Now, prior to that, I was not surprised at that comment because back in 1994, I had a meeting with Mr. DeMato, not the senator, who was the chief counsel for the Senate Appropriations Committee, and he informed me that they felt that there was upwards of or in excess of $900 billion a year missing out of the Treasury going into so-called black projects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. Now, this is a misnomer, just so that the committee knows, the proper term in the military and intelligence world is an unacknowledged special access project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. Now, special access projects are projects that, of course, you have to be read into with various clearances.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. The unacknowledged ones are ones for which there is no acknowledgment on paper, and anyone in the project is ordered not to speak about it under threat of termination with extreme prejudice, which is death.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. My senior military advisor was in one such project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. He has not even informed me what it concerned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. It was under Admiral Harry Train.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. It was a $3 billion project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. This is one project that was unacknowledged.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. So this is not a theory.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. This is how the deep national security state actually operates that the members of Congress usually are not aware of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. Now, in the ensuing year, since 2001, we have continued these briefings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. We've had greater success in other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. There are now more than 14 countries that have opened their UFO files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. We've been very instrumental in this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. I've worked with people at the Vatican, the French government, and what is also very exciting is that one of the most important documents in history, which I'll provide to the committee, is a document from the Ministry of Defense of France committing to my organization to engage in a long-term project to make peaceful contact with these "visitors."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. This document has not been yet released.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. I will provide it to the committee, and there is great progress being made in other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. Admiral Moran, who won the Ampere Prize in France and is an MD, as I am, and also a PhD physicist, and has been an advisor and was an advisor to President Sarkozy and others, has been meeting with us and we have been involved with projects in other countries to do this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. I will tell you, however, that as they began to step into this, they were warned off by someone within the national security state saying, "Do not pursue this."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. We went to France about two years, three years ago, and we had an expedition to actually make contact with these extraterrestrial civilizations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. The admiral later informed us that their radar tracked objects that came over the site at between 100,000 and 200,000 kilometers an hour.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. Now, what is fascinating about this is that the French were not deterred from doing this project with us, but they have to date remained fairly quiet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. There is, therefore, progress being made in other G7 countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. As you know, we have a former Minister of Defense of Canada here who is very supportive, the Honorable Paul Hellyer, and what we find, however, is that the United States has remained a black hole of secrecy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. Now, the reason for this is complex.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. One of the reasons is inertia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. Once you go into an unacknowledged special access project, it's very hard to bring things out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. Number two is that this is the crown jewel in America of the defense industry and the aerospace industry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. My uncle was a senior project engineer at Grumman that became Northrop Grumman that put the first man on the moon with the lunar module.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. He worked on the lunar module, which is part of how I got involved with this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. What I have found through my uncle and other contacts at Lockheed is that we have had since about the mid-1950s operational electromagnetic-gravitic devices, basically in parlance of the pop culture anti-gravity devices, that are deeply classified and are the next generation beyond rockets and jet aircraft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. These are fully operational and not experimental.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. These have been used very discreetly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. We have an enormous amount of information on this, including a facility, Norton Air Force Base, where we had Frank Carlucci, the Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan, was ushered in there, and some people who were with him, such as Brad Sorensen, have given us information and actually have helped us provide schematics and drawings for these so-called alien reproduction vehicles, a bit of a misnomer because in reality advanced anti-gravity research began with T. Townsend Brown in 1929.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. We will get more into this on Friday.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. The key point here is that the technologies that would give us a new civilization without oil, without gas, without coal, without nuclear power are extant.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. They already exist, they've been developed, and it is a matter of the utmost national security and world peace and justice that we bring these sciences out and start a new chapter in the human experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
