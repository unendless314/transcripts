## Speaker Group 1

273. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. I believe we're a little over time, so how much time will each panelist get?
→ {"text": "我相信我們已經稍微超時了，那麼每位小組成員會有多少時間？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. Six minutes.
→ {"text": "六分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. All right, and I will follow in the footsteps of my co-chair and waive my turn till the end.
→ {"text": "好的，我會追隨共同主席的腳步，將我的發言順序延後至最後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. So Mr. Bartlett.
→ {"text": "那麼，請 Bartlett 先生發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. Dr. Greer, you mentioned that there was a very large amount of money that could not be accounted for in the Pentagon.
→ {"text": "Dr. Greer，您提到五角大樓有一筆非常龐大的款項無法交代其去向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. The Pentagon still cannot be audited.
→ {"text": "五角大樓至今仍無法被審計。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. They hope that they may have books in several years in the future that could be audited.
→ {"text": "他們希望在未來幾年內或許能有可供審計的帳目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. They will not be.
→ {"text": "但他們不會有的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. It's hard to believe that in today's world that, and you know, they spend about half of all the money we vote to spend in the Congress, and we don't spend 1% of our time in the Congress talking about this expenditure.
→ {"text": "在當今世界這很難令人相信，您知道，他們花費了國會表決支出的全部金額的約一半，而我們在國會卻沒有花費 1% 的時間討論這項支出。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. There's a day or so, once a year, when we debate this on the floor and pass this bill, and this spends about half of all the money that we vote to spend.
→ {"text": "每年大約只有一天左右，我們在議場辯論並通過這項法案，而這筆支出約佔我們表決通過的全部款項的一半。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. It's just incredible to me that it's been this long and they still do not have books that can be audited.
→ {"text": "對我來說簡直難以置信，經過這麼長的時間，他們仍然沒有可供審計的帳目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. You mentioned anti-gravity devices.
→ {"text": "您提到了反重力裝置。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. I'd like to know a little bit more about that.
→ {"text": "我想更了解一些相關資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. I know that this is one of the things that Stephen Hawking is trying to harmonize, relativity, gravity and so forth.
→ {"text": "我知道這是 Stephen Hawking 正試圖統一的內容之一，相對論、重力等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. Many people believe that he may be the best mind in a millennium, the Britisher who...
→ {"text": "許多人相信他可能是千年一遇的最佳頭腦，那位英國人……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. Yeah, right.
→ {"text": "是的，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. Well, I think that actually there are two tracks in physics.
→ {"text": "嗯，我認為物理學實際上有兩條軌道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. There's the track you'd find at MIT and there's the track you'd find at the Naval Research Labs.
→ {"text": "有您在麻省理工學院（MIT）會發現的軌道，還有您在海軍研究實驗室（Naval Research Labs）會發現的軌道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. There's the third highest ranking scientist there, and some other folks, as well as some physicists down near the Redstone Arsenal and the Marshall Space Flight Center.
→ {"text": "那裡有第三高階的科學家，還有其他一些人士，以及在紅石兵工廠（Redstone Arsenal）與馬歇爾太空飛行中心（Marshall Space Flight Center）附近的一些物理學家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. I can assure you that they have used very high voltage systems at low input of power, meaning low total energy consumption, to create what's called a Poynting vector into space.
→ {"text": "我可以向您保證，他們使用了極高電壓系統，以低功率輸入——也就是低總能量消耗——來創造所謂的坡印廷向量（Poynting vector）投射到太空中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Whisper 轉錄錯誤：'a pointy vector' → 'a Poynting vector'"}

295. This is tapping what's called the zero point energy field, the renowned defense journalist Nick Cook wrote a book about this called The Hunt for Zero Point.
→ {"text": "這是在汲取所謂的零點能量場（zero point energy field），知名國防記者 Nick Cook 寫了一本關於此主題的書，名為《追尋零點》（The Hunt for Zero Point）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. Without getting too much into the physics of this, I will just say that studies on this matter began actually in the 1920s with T. Townsend Brown, who later became key to the Rand Corporation.
→ {"text": "在不過度深入物理學細節的情況下，我只想說，關於此事的研究實際上始於 1920 年代的托馬斯·湯森·布朗（T. Townsend Brown），他後來成為蘭德公司（Rand Corporation）的核心人物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. But also, I should point out that in Germany, the Koloski-Frost experiment, which we'll go into on Friday, using crystalline structures, and now we're using nano-crystalline materials like you find in transformers to create a electromagnetic field, if you will, around an object that gives it lift.
→ {"text": "此外，我應該指出，在德國進行的 Koloski-Frost 實驗——我們會在週五深入討論——使用結晶結構，而現在我們使用變壓器中會發現的奈米結晶材料，來在物體周圍創造電磁場，從而產生升力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. And there are classified aspects of some of our known aircraft, and I talked to Admiral Wilson about this, such as the B-2 Stealth, that involved this.
→ {"text": "而我們已知的某些飛行器具有機密方面，我與威爾森上將（Admiral Wilson）討論過此事，例如 B-2 隱形轟炸機（B-2 Stealth），就涉及這項技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. But the ones that look like they're circular, so-called flying saucers, there have been prototypes of this for a number of years, and about October 1954, from sources I have who have been in what's called the Vault at the National Security Agency and other facilities, we really figured out gravity control, which means that we can do lifter systems, such as the ones that people report in UFOs.
→ {"text": "但那些看起來是圓形的，也就是所謂的飛碟（flying saucers），這種原型機已經存在多年。根據我在國家安全局（National Security Agency）所謂的「金庫」（Vault）及其他設施工作過的消息來源，大約在 1954 年 10 月，我們真正弄清楚了重力控制，這意味著我們可以製造升力系統，就像人們在不明飛行物（UFO）中報告的那樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. I'd like to reserve enough time to ask you about something else that you mentioned that really concerns me.
→ {"text": "我想保留足夠的時間來詢問您提到的另一件真正令我擔憂的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. Mr. Sheehan mentioned necessary secrets, things that we keep from the American people.
→ {"text": "Sheehan 先生提到了「必要的秘密」，那些我們對美國人民保密的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. I really am conflicted in this area.
→ {"text": "我在這個領域真的很矛盾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. I will acknowledge that you may argue that there are necessary secrets, that there are black projects, you didn't characterize them that way, but some of these top, top secret things that you're talking about, above top secret, it's a black world, I've had several briefings and a special skiff on black projects.
→ {"text": "我承認您可能會主張存在必要的秘密，存在黑預算項目（black projects），雖然您沒有這樣描述它們，但您所談論的這些最高、最高機密事項，超越最高機密（above top secret），這是一個黑色世界，我曾在特殊的保密設施（SKIF）中接受過幾次關於黑預算項目的簡報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. If you can do this, then for the good of the American people, you can ignore the Constitution to do good things.
→ {"text": "如果您可以這樣做，那麼為了美國人民的利益，您就可以為了做好事而忽視憲法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. And we do that.
→ {"text": "而我們確實這樣做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. We do ignore the Constitution to do good things.
→ {"text": "我們確實為了做好事而忽視憲法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. We're ignoring the Constitution to do all of the welfare we do, because it's not an Article I, there's not an enumerated power.
→ {"text": "我們為了進行所有福利工作而忽視憲法，因為這不在第一條（Article I），沒有列舉權力（enumerated power）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. We're ignoring the Constitution to do all of the healthcare that we do.
→ {"text": "我們為了進行所有醫療保健工作而忽視憲法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. We're ignoring the Constitution to do all of the education that we do, because none of those three things, where we spend a huge amount of money, are specific enumerated powers in Article I, Section 8, and both the Ninth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment, pretty clearly say if you can't find it there, you can't do it.
→ {"text": "我們為了進行所有教育工作而忽視憲法，因為我們花費巨額資金的這三項工作，沒有一項是第一條第八款（Article I， Section 8）中的具體列舉權力，而第九修正案（Ninth Amendment）與第十修正案（Tenth Amendment）都相當明確地表示，如果您在那裡找不到，就不能做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. Now my conflict is that whereas I recognize that there may be necessary secrets, if you extrapolate from this, then you can ignore the Constitution to do good things.
→ {"text": "現在我的矛盾在於，雖然我承認可能存在必要的秘密，但如果從中推論，那麼您就可以為了做好事而忽視憲法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. If today you ignore the Constitution to do good things, tomorrow you can ignore the Constitution to do bad things.
→ {"text": "如果今天您為了做好事而忽視憲法，明天您就可以為了做壞事而忽視憲法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. Well, I think that's where we are today, and I think this is what Dwight Eisenhower, President Eisenhower said in his last address when he said, "Beware the military-industrial complex."
→ {"text": "嗯，我認為這就是我們今日所處的境地，我認為這就是德懷特·艾森豪（Dwight Eisenhower），艾森豪總統在他最後的演說中所說的：「警惕軍工複合體。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. And if I might say so, I think that the withholding from the public of this information is not only a crime against humanity, it is actually causing us to stay on a petrodollar system that is destroying the environment.
→ {"text": "如果我可以這麼說，我認為對公眾隱瞞這些資訊不僅是對人類的犯罪，實際上還導致我們繼續依賴正在摧毀環境的石油美元體系（petrodollar system）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. I think most people miss the reason.
→ {"text": "我認為大多數人都忽略了原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. My meeting with the CIA Director Woolsey, the only thing he wanted to know is, "Why won't they tell me about this?"
→ {"text": "我與 CIA 局長伍爾西（CIA Director Woolsey）的會面中，他唯一想知道的是：「為什麼他們不告訴我這件事？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Whisper 轉錄錯誤：'CIA Director Wolsey' → 'CIA Director Woolsey'"}

316. And the same thing with Lord Hill Norton, the Minister of Defense of Great Britain, and I said, "Sir, the reason they don't is that you're good folk, and you would not go along with criminal secrecy, illegal secrecy, that is withholding science and technologies that would give us a civilization without oil."
→ {"text": "英國國防大臣彼得·希爾-諾頓勳爵（Lord Hill Norton）也是如此，我對他說：「長官，他們不告訴您的原因是因為您是好人，您不會配合犯罪性的保密、非法的保密，這些保密隱瞞了能讓我們擁有無需石油文明的科學與技術。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. Now, but that's a multi-trillion dollar problem, and I think we've reached the point where the tail is wagging the dog.
→ {"text": "但這是一個數兆美元的問題，我認為我們已經到了尾巴搖狗的地步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. The special interest and the influence from corrupting, I'm going to use the word, corrupting influences within the national security state ties right straight into the macroeconomic order and the petrodollar system.
→ {"text": "特殊利益集團與來自國家安全國家內部的腐化——我要使用「腐化」這個詞——腐化影響力，直接與宏觀經濟秩序與石油美元體系（petrodollar system）掛鉤。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

319. The secrecy isn't because people are going to hurl themselves off the bridge into the Potomac River because we're not alone in the universe.
→ {"text": "保密的原因不是因為人們會跳下波托馬克河上的橋樑，因為我們在宇宙中並不孤單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. Sixty-five percent of the public believe there's intelligent life out there.
→ {"text": "百分之六十五的公眾相信宇宙中存在智慧生命。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. Over half the public believe we've been visited.
→ {"text": "超過一半的公眾相信我們曾被造訪過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. Forty-three percent believe they're here and visiting us currently, and these are in recent polls.
→ {"text": "百分之四十三的人相信他們現在就在這裡造訪我們，這些都是最近的民意調查結果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. The bigger issue is, why would we be keeping this secret?
→ {"text": "更大的問題是，我們為什麼要保守這個秘密？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. There is a document that I have from the Federation of American Scientists released two years ago that there are 5,135 patents that have been seized under the National Security Act.
→ {"text": "我手上有一份美國科學家聯盟（Federation of American Scientists）兩年前發布的文件，顯示有 5，135 項專利已根據《國家安全法》（National Security Act）被扣押。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. Dr. Greer, we have to end your response, and it is Senator Gravel.
→ {"text": "Dr. Greer，我們必須結束您的回答，現在輪到格拉維爾參議員（Senator Gravel）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. I won't take my full time because some of these questions need to be elaborated like Dr. Greer was doing, but let me add, because of our view that we want to get the Congress to do something, there's a ruling of the Supreme Court, and my colleague will be interested in about the constitutionality of it.
→ {"text": "我不會用完我的全部時間，因為其中一些問題需要像 Dr. Greer 那樣詳細闡述，但讓我補充一點，因為我們的觀點是希望國會採取行動，最高法院有一項裁決，我的同事會對其合憲性感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. I was prosecuted by the Nixon administration, and my defense, which Daniel Sheehan is very knowledgeable about, was the speech and debate clause of the constitution.
→ {"text": "我曾被尼克森政府起訴，而我的辯護——丹尼爾·希恩（Daniel Sheehan）對此非常了解——是憲法的言論與辯論條款（speech and debate clause）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Whisper 轉錄錯誤：'Danny Sheen' → 'Daniel Sheehan'"}

328. I released the Pentagon Papers as a sitting United States Senator.
→ {"text": "我作為在任的美國參議員發布了五角大樓文件（Pentagon Papers）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. That ruling was finally rendered in 1972.
→ {"text": "該裁決最終於 1972 年作出。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. It was a 9-4 that still left me exposed because I published the papers outside of the Senate in addition to releasing them in the Senate, but it was a unanimous decision that I had the right to reveal any secret that I had knowledge of to the public and could not be questioned in any other domain of the government.
→ {"text": "那是 9 比 4 的裁決，仍然讓我面臨風險，因為除了在參議院發布這些文件外，我還在參議院外出版了這些文件，但這是一項一致的決議，即我有權向公眾揭露我所知道的任何秘密，並且不能在政府的任何其他領域受到質疑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. That is the law of the land since 1972, and it hasn't been changed.
→ {"text": "這是自 1972 年以來的國土法律，而且沒有改變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. No, there's the law, and there's the law that's sanctified by the Supreme Court decision, and so this element of the constitution is rock solid, and yet, when we turn to the Congress, oh, why don't they ... First, they're being lied to, but what little information you get like the various committees on secrecy and defense, I mean, they have bodies of knowledge that they should just as a matter of course release to the American people, and that would begin to alter this paradigm that we accept as a nation that we can be lied to by our politicians wantonly, and nothing is ever done about it.
→ {"text": "不，有法律，也有最高法院裁決所神聖化的法律，所以憲法的這一要素是堅如磐石的。然而，當我們轉向國會時，哦，為什麼他們不……首先，他們被欺騙了，但您從各種保密與國防委員會那裡得到的少量資訊，我的意思是，他們擁有應該作為慣例向美國人民發布的知識體系，這將開始改變我們作為一個國家接受的這種範式，即我們的政客可以肆意對我們撒謊，而對此從未採取任何行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. That's one comment I wanted to add, and I want to add to him also, he was saying it, but I want to say it more clearly.
→ {"text": "這是我想補充的一點評論，我還想補充他所說的，但我想更清楚地說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. The Defense Department has never been auditable.
→ {"text": "國防部從未可供審計。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. You can't audit it, and it's wishful thinking that you think that they'll ever get to that because it's convenient to not audit what's going on.
→ {"text": "您無法審計它，而您認為他們會達到那個目標是一廂情願的想法，因為不審計正在進行的事情是很方便的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. The other is I want to add to Sheehan's comments, which of course was I'm sure a revelation to a lot of people, that here in Israel, we shipped this nuclear capability to Israel, and one of their tasks was to share it with the Shah.
→ {"text": "另外，我想補充希恩（Sheehan）的評論，這當然對很多人來說是一個啟示，即我們在這裡向以色列運送了這種核能力，他們的任務之一就是與伊朗國王（Shah）分享。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. Well, the adding to that is we gave the Shah an experimental nuclear reactor, which is in Tehran today, and the plan for that reactor was to be able to build bombs that would be under the control of the Shah or under the control of the United States.
→ {"text": "嗯，補充的是，我們給了伊朗國王一個實驗性核反應爐，現在還在德黑蘭，該反應爐的計畫是能夠製造由伊朗國王或美國控制的炸彈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. What had happened after the revolution, and this is what most Americans don't know right now, is that it was the Ayatollah Khomeini who made the decision that that reactor would not be used for any nuclear devices, bomb-making devices.
→ {"text": "革命後發生的事情，這是大多數美國人現在不知道的，是由阿亞圖拉·霍梅尼（Ayatollah Khomeini）做出了決定，該反應爐不會用於任何核裝置、製造炸彈的裝置。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. It was an internal decision by the supreme, the imam, that they would not do that because the Quran did not sanction weapons of mass destruction.
→ {"text": "這是最高領袖、伊瑪目的內部決定，他們不會這樣做，因為《古蘭經》不認可大規模殺傷性武器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

340. And now when you get the take by American media that, "Oh my God, they're searching for the bomb."
→ {"text": "現在，當您從美國媒體得到的說法是：「天哪，他們正在尋找炸彈。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. We tried to give them the bomb under the Shah, and they're the ones that decided they don't want it.
→ {"text": "我們曾試圖在伊朗國王統治下給他們炸彈，而他們是決定不要的一方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. It's immoral.
→ {"text": "這是不道德的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. I just wanted to add that.
→ {"text": "我只是想補充這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. Those are the two points that I wanted to make.
→ {"text": "這是我想提出的兩點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. I'll yield back the balance of my time because I can't think of an intelligent question I could ask to the intelligent testimony we just had.
→ {"text": "我將交還我剩餘的時間，因為我想不出可以向剛才的智慧證詞提出的智慧問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. That's nice.
→ {"text": "很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. Congresswoman Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "基爾派屈克女眾議員（Congresswoman Kilpatrick）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. Thank you very much, and again, thank you for your testimony.
→ {"text": "非常感謝，再次感謝您的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. You're absolutely right, Senator.
→ {"text": "您說得完全正確，參議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. I think today's whole experience has been one of intelligence, higher than we're normal in our society.
→ {"text": "我認為今天的整個體驗都是智慧的體現，比我們社會正常水準更高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. Maybe this room itself and our subject matter may have something to do with that, but we appreciate your service.
→ {"text": "也許這個房間本身以及我們的主題與此有關，但我們感謝您的服務。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

352. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. Going back to the millions of dollars that are missing, or inaudible, or missing, in the defensive budget over several years, 2.3, Dr. Greer, I think was the number you gave, 2.3 trillion, 2.3 trillion, and that's over several years.
→ {"text": "回到國防預算中失蹤的數百萬美元，或者說無法審計的，或者說失蹤的，在幾年間，Dr. Greer，我想您提到的數字是 2.3——2.3 兆美元，2.3 兆美元，而且這是幾年累積的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. I know most of you know at the table that we have also passed an intelligence budget in the Congress.
→ {"text": "我知道在座的大多數人都知道，我們在國會還通過了一項情報預算。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. All intelligence matters are funded in that budget, and as members of Congress, we don't debate it.
→ {"text": "所有情報事務都由該預算資助，而作為國會議員，我們不會辯論它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. We don't know its bottom number or any of that because, quote, it's over our classified.
→ {"text": "我們不知道它的底線數字或任何相關資訊，因為，引述，這超出了我們的機密等級。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. Members of Congress are also classified to a point.
→ {"text": "國會議員也有一定程度的機密等級。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. When we come in office, as you know, I'm sure we take an oath and sign for the intelligence level that we can hear.
→ {"text": "如您所知，我相信，當我們上任時，我們宣誓並簽署我們可以聽取的情報等級。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

359. Of course, there's super, super intelligence that we don't, and I think we're discussing much of that today, which is where the money is and where that intelligence budget is gone.
→ {"text": "當然，還有超級、超級情報，我們無法獲得，我認為我們今天討論的大部分內容，就是資金所在以及情報預算的去向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. You mentioned emergency and everything we talked about today, and my newspaper person came up to me this ... I told them I'll speak to them on Friday after I learn more, but they still keep coming.
→ {"text": "您提到了緊急情況，以及我們今天談論的所有內容，我的新聞界人士今天來找我……我告訴他們我會在週五學到更多後再與他們交談，但他們還是不斷前來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. I don't usually speak unless I know something.

→ {"text": "嗯，我認為有一句很棒的中國諺語：「除非我們改變方向，否則我們很可能會到達我們正在前往的地方。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. The point is, if you look at the trend lines of where our civilization's going, the intractable mess we have in the Middle East, and of course, when we say national security interests in the Middle East, it means oil.
→ {"text": "重點是，如果您看看我們文明的發展趨勢線，我們在中東的棘手混亂，當然，當我們說中東的國家安全利益時，這意味著石油。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. Why are we still on oil?
→ {"text": "我們為什麼還在使用石油？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. I think we're on oil, and coal, and nuclear power, because there has been an active longitude and a long-term suppression of really advanced sciences and technologies.

450. Am I right in that implication?

451. To clarify, those are the documents that would be available within those governments that are not in an unacknowledged special access project.
→ {"text": "澄清一下，那些是在這些政府內部可獲得的文件，但不在未公開特別許可項目（unacknowledged special access project）中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. Great Britain, for example, has recently opened up a large number of files, but those are the ones that can be obtained by a FOIA-type officer, same thing in France.
→ {"text": "例如，英國最近開放了大量檔案，但那些是可以通過類似資訊自由法（FOIA）的官員獲得的檔案，法國也是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "其中一些其他國家也存在這些未公開項目的對應物，我們已經發現了——當然包括英國，當然包括加拿大，還有法國。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. But I think that what we have to understand is that they have at least been making the attempt to show interest and support for bringing out this information.
→ {"text": "但我認為我們必須理解的是，他們至少一直在努力表現出對公開這些資訊的興趣與支持。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. I think in South America, we've even seen more support, with some governments having offices in their ministries of defense, investigating this and releasing information almost in real time.
→ {"text": "我認為在南美洲，我們甚至看到了更多的支持，一些政府在其國防部設有辦公室，調查此事並幾乎即時發布資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. So I think we're seeing more disclosure in some of these other countries.

457. The United States has been the most recalcitrant.

460. Now, Secretary of Defense Cohen -- I think most of you may have known him during the Clinton years -- he was given information also from Gordon Cooper, one of our witnesses who was an astronaut, and he also said, "Look, I've looked into this, and there's a great deal of activity, but they won't share it with me," from the secretary of defense.
→ {"text": "現在，國防部長科恩（Secretary of Defense Cohen）——我想你們大多數人可能在柯林頓年代認識他——他也從戈登·庫珀（Gordon Cooper）那裡獲得了資訊，戈登·庫珀是我們的證人之一，他是一位太空人，他也說：「聽著，我調查過此事，有大量活動，但他們不會與我分享」，這是國防部長說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. So yeah, but that $2.3 trillion, we don't know quite where it's going.

462. Okay, but when you say that we don't know quite where it's going, is it part of that or all of that or some of that, the unacknowledged special access processes that you talk about?

466. Projects.

467. Those, yes, by definition, if the secretary of defense keeps tracking -- So a lot of that $2.3 trillion is those?
→ {"text": "那些，是的，根據定義，如果國防部長不斷追蹤——所以那 2.3 兆美元中的很多是那些？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. Over several decades, and we estimate it's between, at this point, $100 billion and $200 billion a year.
→ {"text": "在幾十年內，我們估計目前每年在 1，000 億至 2，000 億美元之間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. That would give us universal health care, by the way.
→ {"text": "順便說一下，這能為我們提供全民醫療保健。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. And I'm not defending any of this part, but look -- [applause] I'm not defending this aspect of it, but if $2.3 trillion is, in fact, the unacknowledged special access project, is that what you're saying?
→ {"text": "我並不是在為這部分辯護，但聽著——【掌聲】我並不是在為這方面辯護，但如果 2.3 兆美元事實上是未公開特別許可項目，這是您說的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. Apparently, if the secretary of defense -- Well, that's not really -- oh, you're saying it could be.
→ {"text": "顯然，如果國防部長——嗯，那不完全是——哦，您是說可能是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. You just don't know.

474. We think it is, and in fact, I believe that's what he was saying over a number of years, many years.
→ {"text": "我們認為是的，事實上，我相信這就是他在許多年，很多年來所說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. If we have counted in those projects things like anti-gravity machines, things like space elevators that are based on anti-gravity research and magnetism and electricity that goes far beyond any of us are really totally aware of right now, or some may be, or I can think of a number of things, but here's my question.
→ {"text": "如果我們在這些項目中計算了像反重力機器、基於反重力研究以及磁力和電力的太空電梯等東西，這遠遠超出了我們現在真正完全了解的範圍，或者有些人可能了解，或者我能想到的許多事情，但這是我的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. Yes.

477. And I want you to really give me your best possible feeling on this.

478. Is some of that clearly, legitimately, withheld for national security reasons?

479. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

480. In fact, I was approached by some folks after Obama was elected to support an initiative to privately bring out the lifter or electromagnetic gravitics, and I said because they could become a delivery system, and I was meeting with an Air Force colonel at the time, I think that some of that needs to be looked at very carefully.

482. So I think that -- Of course.

483. So I think you do have to have a very -- and I'm saying this, and I know there are people who probably in the disclosure movement are going to be appalled by what I'm about to say -- is that we do not yet live in a world where everyone on the planet should have a lifter and transfer transportation system that could get us from here to Paris in two or three minutes, and I think that those sort of technologies obviously have weapons delivery applications.

484. However, the part of the technology that deals with energy generation should come out and has also been suppressed for reasons mainly of macroeconomic stability, because as you know, part of the national security discussion has always been these would be highly disruptive technologies, to which I say, well, good, you want to be disrupted now or later when we go through a terminus with the environment melting down around us.

485. We have got to make these hard decisions.
→ {"text": "我們必須做出這些艱難的決定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

486. Okay, well, then my last question to you, Dr. Greer, would be these 14 countries that are disclosing, or at least making it possible for the people in those countries and people around the world to know what's in those files, is it possible that one of the reasons they may be motivated over the United States is because they think some of this stuff that's being seen and this phenomena, the maneuvering that's been talked about, the maneuvering that defies the laws of physics, might be something the United States is testing, that the United States just refuses to talk about?
→ {"text": "好的，那麼我對您的最後一個問題，Dr. Greer，將是這 14 個正在揭露或至少讓這些國家的人民以及世界各地的人知道這些檔案內容的國家，是否有可能他們的動機之一超過美國的原因是，他們認為一些被看到的東西和這種現象，被談論的機動性，違反物理定律的機動性，可能是美國正在測試的東西，而美國只是拒絕談論它？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

487. Correct.

488. They do know that that's the case, and in fact, yes.

491. They know that some of them are man-made, and the Lockheed Skunk Works and some of my witnesses and sources work in the famous Skunk Works, and I will tell you that Ben Rich, who headed up the Lockheed Skunk Works, said before he died, and we have a witness to this comment that we "already have the technologies to take ET home."

502. This was one of my key points that I made to Mr. Rockefeller and to the Clinton administration, is that when you have almost 60 percent of the public believing this is real and some part of the government's hiding it, it makes a laughing stock when the Air Force has trotted out to say everything's a weather balloon.

It's just as ridiculous, so the more we can release, the better, and I think the technology end of it needs to at least be released at the level where we would be able to have practical applications and sort of a peace dividend and an environmental dividend to this $2.3 trillion that are unaccounted for in the Department of Defense, and that certainly ought to happen.
→ {"text": "這同樣荒謬，所以我們能發布的越多越好，我認為其中的技術部分至少需要在我們能夠擁有實際應用的層面上發布，並對這 2.3 兆美元未計入國防部的資金獲得某種和平紅利和環境紅利，這當然應該發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

## Speaker Group 2

505. I, too, was appalled when I sat on the Budget Committee and found out that the Defense Department was the only department that can't get through an audit, and the point I used to push with the Budget Committee was, "Well, let's get started someplace."
→ {"text": "我也對坐在預算委員會時發現國防部是唯一無法通過審計的部門感到震驚，我過去在預算委員會推動的觀點是：「好吧，讓我們從某個地方開始。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

506. I mean, take a department, take a segment of a department, anything to begin to understand how the military spends its budget.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，選一個部門，選一個部門的某個部分，任何能開始理解軍方如何花費其預算的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

507. Do you think that, with what they do and much of the secrecy they work under, whether it's legitimate or not, do you think that's ever possible?
→ {"text": "您認為，鑑於他們所做的事情以及他們所處的大部分保密，無論是合法還是非法，您認為這可能嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

508. Well, I think, you know, we would have to make a concerted effort, and I have to tell you, the look of fear, and I'm being very honest here, the fear and the anger I saw in the faces of General Patrick Hughes and Admiral Wilson when we provided the information that I'm going to provide for you, and which was provided to these people, as well as C.I.
→ {"text": "嗯，我認為，您知道，我們必須做出一致的努力，我必須告訴您，當我們提供我將為您提供的資訊時，我在派翠克·休斯將軍（General Patrick Hughes）和威爾森上將（Admiral Wilson）臉上看到的恐懼和憤怒，我非常誠實地說，這種恐懼和憤怒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. Director Woolsey.
→ {"text": "伍爾西局長（Director Woolsey）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

510. It was palpable, because they realized that there was this very deep secret national security state that even they, who are supposed to be looking out after our best interests, were being denied access to, and when I asked the Admiral, Admiral Wilson, the head of intelligence joint staff, to please try to get control of this, he looked at me, he says, "My understanding now is that the best thing I have is a B2 stealth.
→ {"text": "這是顯而易見的，因為他們意識到存在這個非常深層的秘密國家安全國家（national security state），即使是他們，應該照顧我們最佳利益的人，也被拒絕訪問，當我要求上將，威爾森上將，聯合參謀部情報主管，請試圖控制這個時，他看著我，他說：「我現在的理解是，我擁有的最好的東西是 B2 隱形轟炸機。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. What this secret organization has are things that can do circles around it.
→ {"text": "這個秘密組織擁有的東西可以繞著它轉圈。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

512. I'm outgunned."
→ {"text": "我被比下去了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

513. He also said that until the civilian leaders of the government order him to do something, the Secretary of Defense and the President, he can only do so much, but we couldn't get President Clinton to lean into this for reasons, well, I don't know if I want to even go into that, but it's for security reasons, safety reasons.
→ {"text": "他還說，除非政府的文職領導人，國防部長和總統，命令他做某事，否則他只能做這麼多，但我們無法讓柯林頓總統（President Clinton）深入此事，原因是，嗯，我不知道我是否想深入探討，但這是出於安全原因、安全理由。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

514. So I think that this is the sort of problem you run into, and General Patrick Hughes went over to a shelf, now this is the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, huge, and he said, "This is all I've ever gotten from the Defense Intelligence Agency chain of command in my inquiries into this subject," and he had a little ET doll brought at a toy store, and we all laughed but wanted to cry.
→ {"text": "所以我認為這就是您會遇到的問題，派翠克·休斯將軍（General Patrick Hughes）走到一個架子前，現在這是國防情報局（Defense Intelligence Agency）局長，巨大的，他說：「這就是我從國防情報局指揮鏈對此主題的調查中獲得的全部」，他有一個在玩具店買的小 ET 娃娃，我們都笑了但想哭。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

515. So here you have a general and an admiral and a CIA director, and these people were not just picking my brain trying to figure out what I knew, they honestly were being denied access.
→ {"text": "所以您這裡有一位將軍、一位上將和一位 CIA 局長，這些人不只是在挖我的腦子試圖弄清楚我知道什麼，他們確實被拒絕訪問（being denied access）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

516. How can this be?
→ {"text": "這怎麼可能？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

517. How can it be?
→ {"text": "怎麼可能？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

518. Well, that's what I found in the hearing when I asked about how do we get to that place where they can go through an audit.
→ {"text": "嗯，這就是我在聽證會上詢問我們如何到達他們可以進行審計的地方時發現的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

519. It was, I mean, it was sort of a big joke, like, "Well, we're never going to be able to do that," so there.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，這有點像一個大笑話，比如：「嗯，我們永遠無法做到」，就這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

520. One of the reasons is this, and this is going to have to get reformed somehow, I know an auditor for my uncle's old company, Northrop Grumman, he said, "Basically, if you're dealing with one of these unacknowledged projects, they will tell you, 'Well, we have an undisclosed amount of money doing an undisclosed project, and you don't have a need to know,' and they will then just rubber-stamp what's going into Northrop Grumman, or Lockheed Martin, or Science Applications International Corporation, or MITRE Corporation."
→ {"text": "其中一個原因是這個，這必須以某種方式改革，我認識我叔叔的老公司諾斯洛普格魯曼（Northrop Grumman）的一位審計員，他說：「基本上，如果您正在處理這些未公開項目之一，他們會告訴您：『嗯，我們有一筆未公開的金額在做一個未公開的項目，而您沒有知曉的必要性』，然後他們會直接橡皮圖章批准進入諾斯洛普格魯曼、洛克希德馬丁（Lockheed Martin）、科學應用國際公司（Science Applications International Corporation）或 MITRE 公司的款項。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

521. Now, I have a whole list.
→ {"text": "現在，我有一整份清單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

522. One of the sections in here that I will provide for you, and Congressman Christopher Cox, who later became Bush's head of the SEC, asked me to put this together for him, and it's a list of the facilities and corporations and sub-corporations and sub-facilities where this activity is going on.
→ {"text": "我將為您提供的其中一個部分，眾議員克里斯托弗·考克斯（Congressman Christopher Cox），他後來成為布希的證券交易委員會（SEC）主管，要求我為他整理這個，這是一份設施、公司、子公司和子設施的清單，這些活動正在進行的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

523. This is actionable intelligence if anyone wants to follow up on it.
→ {"text": "如果有人想跟進，這是可行的情報。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

524. So yes, you can find out.
→ {"text": "所以是的，您可以找出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

525. We have found out, but it's something that would have to be a concerted effort under subpoena power by people who would not take no for an answer, and that I think the people deserve.
→ {"text": "我們已經找出來了，但這需要在傳票權力下進行一致的努力，由不會接受拒絕答案的人進行，我認為人民應該得到這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

526. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

527. Well, this is virtually the end of this panel, and the next one is about ready to start, but I always have things that kind of hang in the air, because nothing we're learning is going to make any difference if we can't do anything about it, if we don't.
→ {"text": "嗯，這個小組實際上已經結束了，下一個小組即將開始，但我總是有一些懸而未決的事情，因為如果我們不能對此做任何事情，如果我們不這樣做，我們正在學習的一切都不會有任何區別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

528. And in 1995, the Rockefeller-funded conference in Asilomar, my question, as you were talking about it, was, well, what were their goals?
→ {"text": "而在 1995 年，洛克菲勒資助的在 Asilomar 的會議，我的問題，當您談論它時，是，他們的目標是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "已修正 Whisper 轉錄錯誤：'conference in the Sylmar' → 'conference in Asilomar'"}

529. What did they accomplish?
→ {"text": "他們實現了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

530. And did anything really happen because of that?
→ {"text": "因為那次會議真的發生了什麼事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

531. And what we're doing today, this many years later, is there enough different out there that we can make a difference this week?
→ {"text": "我們今天所做的，這麼多年後，外面是否有足夠的不同，我們可以在本週產生影響？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

532. Yes, ma'am, it's part of a process, and that meeting was a meeting to get together the initial governmental witnesses and to create a support group for them.
→ {"text": "是的，女士，這是一個過程的一部分，那次會議是為了召集最初的政府證人並為他們創建一個支持小組。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

533. I had grown men, old enough to be my grandfather, cry on my shoulder and say, "We've been wanting to talk about this our whole lives," who were astronauts, who were cosmonauts.
→ {"text": "我有年齡大到足以成為我祖父的成年男子在我肩膀上哭泣，說：「我們一輩子都想談論這個」，他們是太空人，他們是太空員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

534. I said, "Okay, let's do that," but they were afraid.
→ {"text": "我說：「好的，讓我們這樣做」，但他們害怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

535. They had signed oaths saying that they would never talk about any of this stuff, and they were afraid, and some of them had been in unacknowledged projects where they were told they would be terminated, killed, if they talked about it, and this is true.
→ {"text": "他們簽署了誓言，說他們永遠不會談論任何這些東西，他們害怕，其中一些人曾在未公開項目中，他們被告知如果談論它就會被終止、被殺，這是真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

536. So it was a process, and what I wanted to have happen, in 1997, when we had the meetings for various members of Congress, we had hoped that members of Congress who were chair of committees would pick up this mantle.
→ {"text": "所以這是一個過程，我想要發生的是，在 1997 年，當我們為國會各成員舉行會議時，我們希望擔任委員會主席的國會議員能接下這個使命。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

537. I'm still working full-time as an emergency doctor with four daughters and a golden retriever, and I have a life.
→ {"text": "我仍在全職工作，作為急診醫師，有四個女兒和一隻黃金獵犬，我有生活。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

538. I was doing this as a sort of a voluntary thing, but unfortunately, no one really wanted to pick this up.
→ {"text": "我是作為一種自願的事情在做這個，但不幸的是，沒有人真的想接下這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

539. But I think that if we come together as a people, we can do it.
→ {"text": "但我認為如果我們作為人民團結起來，我們可以做到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

540. Now, with this process, there's the possibility of galvanizing a larger movement, because I think if the people will lead, the leaders will have to follow, but we have to get the information that we have out.
→ {"text": "現在，通過這個過程，有可能激發一個更大的運動，因為我認為如果人民帶頭，領導者就必須跟隨，但我們必須把我們擁有的資訊公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

541. But I think that to the extent that you folks could influence some of your colleagues who are still in the Congress to take a serious interest in this, that isn't just a dog-and-pony show of denial and ridicule, but really drills down on the, again, actionable intelligence that we've put together over the last 15 years, I think that that would result to really the lid coming off this thing and the people knowing the truth once and for all.
→ {"text": "但我認為，在您們能夠影響您們在國會中的一些仍在任的同事，讓他們認真對待此事，而不僅僅是拒絕和嘲笑的狗和小馬秀，而是真正深入挖掘我們在過去 15 年中整理的，再次，可行的情報，我認為這將導致這件事的蓋子真正被揭開，人民終於知道真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

542. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

543. Thank you.
