## Speaker Group 1

273. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. I believe we're a little over time, so how much time will each panelist get?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. Six minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. All right, and I will follow in the footsteps of my co-chair and waive my turn till the end.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. So Mr. Bartlett.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. Dr. Greer, you mentioned that there was a very large amount of money that could not be accounted for in the Pentagon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. The Pentagon still cannot be audited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. They hope that they may have books in several years in the future that could be audited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. They will not be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. It's hard to believe that in today's world that, and you know, they spend about half of all the money we vote to spend in the Congress, and we don't spend 1% of our time in the Congress talking about this expenditure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. There's a day or so, once a year, when we debate this on the floor and pass this bill, and this spends about half of all the money that we vote to spend.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. It's just incredible to me that it's been this long and they still do not have books that can be audited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. You mentioned anti-gravity devices.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. I'd like to know a little bit more about that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. I know that this is one of the things that Stephen Hawking is trying to harmonize, relativity, gravity and so forth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. Many people believe that he may be the best mind in a millennium, the Britisher who...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. Yeah, right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. Well, I think that actually there are two tracks in physics.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. There's the track you'd find at MIT and there's the track you'd find at the Naval Research Labs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. There's the third highest ranking scientist there, and some other folks, as well as some physicists down near the Redstone Arsenal and the Marshall Space Flight Center.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. I can assure you that they have used very high voltage systems at low input of power, meaning low total energy consumption, to create what's called a Poynting vector into space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. This is tapping what's called the zero point energy field, the renowned defense journalist Nick Cook wrote a book about this called The Hunt for Zero Point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. Without getting too much into the physics of this, I will just say that studies on this matter began actually in the 1920s with T. Townsend Brown, who later became key to the Rand Corporation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. But also, I should point out that in Germany, the Koloski-Frost experiment, which we'll go into on Friday, using crystalline structures, and now we're using nano-crystalline materials like you find in transformers to create a electromagnetic field, if you will, around an object that gives it lift.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. And there are classified aspects of some of our known aircraft, and I talked to Admiral Wilson about this, such as the B-2 Stealth, that involved this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. But the ones that look like they're circular, so-called flying saucers, there have been prototypes of this for a number of years, and about October 1954, from sources I have who have been in what's called the Vault at the National Security Agency and other facilities, we really figured out gravity control, which means that we can do lifter systems, such as the ones that people report in UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. I'd like to reserve enough time to ask you about something else that you mentioned that really concerns me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. Mr. Sheehan mentioned necessary secrets, things that we keep from the American people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. I really am conflicted in this area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. I will acknowledge that you may argue that there are necessary secrets, that there are black projects, you didn't characterize them that way, but some of these top, top secret things that you're talking about, above top secret, it's a black world, I've had several briefings and a special skiff on black projects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. If you can do this, then for the good of the American people, you can ignore the Constitution to do good things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. And we do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. We do ignore the Constitution to do good things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. We're ignoring the Constitution to do all of the welfare we do, because it's not an Article I, there's not an enumerated power.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. We're ignoring the Constitution to do all of the healthcare that we do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. We're ignoring the Constitution to do all of the education that we do, because none of those three things, where we spend a huge amount of money, are specific enumerated powers in Article I, Section 8, and both the Ninth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment, pretty clearly say if you can't find it there, you can't do it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. Now my conflict is that whereas I recognize that there may be necessary secrets, if you extrapolate from this, then you can ignore the Constitution to do good things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. If today you ignore the Constitution to do good things, tomorrow you can ignore the Constitution to do bad things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. Well, I think that's where we are today, and I think this is what Dwight Eisenhower, President Eisenhower said in his last address when he said, "Beware the military-industrial complex."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. And if I might say so, I think that the withholding from the public of this information is not only a crime against humanity, it is actually causing us to stay on a petrodollar system that is destroying the environment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. I think most people miss the reason.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. My meeting with the CIA Director Woolsey, the only thing he wanted to know is, "Why won't they tell me about this?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. And the same thing with Lord Hill Norton, the Minister of Defense of Great Britain, and I said, "Sir, the reason they don't is that you're good folk, and you would not go along with criminal secrecy, illegal secrecy, that is withholding science and technologies that would give us a civilization without oil."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. Now, but that's a multi-trillion dollar problem, and I think we've reached the point where the tail is wagging the dog.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. The special interest and the influence from corrupting, I'm going to use the word, corrupting influences within the national security state ties right straight into the macroeconomic order and the petrodollar system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. The secrecy isn't because people are going to hurl themselves off the bridge into the Potomac River because we're not alone in the universe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. Sixty-five percent of the public believe there's intelligent life out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. Over half the public believe we've been visited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. Forty-three percent believe they're here and visiting us currently, and these are in recent polls.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. The bigger issue is, why would we be keeping this secret?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. There is a document that I have from the Federation of American Scientists released two years ago that there are 5,135 patents that have been seized under the National Security Act.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. Dr. Greer, we have to end your response, and it is Senator Gravel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. I won't take my full time because some of these questions need to be elaborated like Dr. Greer was doing, but let me add, because of our view that we want to get the Congress to do something, there's a ruling of the Supreme Court, and my colleague will be interested in about the constitutionality of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. I was prosecuted by the Nixon administration, and my defense, which Daniel Sheehan is very knowledgeable about, was the speech and debate clause of the constitution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. I released the Pentagon Papers as a sitting United States Senator.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. That ruling was finally rendered in 1972.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. It was a 9-4 that still left me exposed because I published the papers outside of the Senate in addition to releasing them in the Senate, but it was a unanimous decision that I had the right to reveal any secret that I had knowledge of to the public and could not be questioned in any other domain of the government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. That is the law of the land since 1972, and it hasn't been changed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. No, there's the law, and there's the law that's sanctified by the Supreme Court decision, and so this element of the constitution is rock solid, and yet, when we turn to the Congress, oh, why don't they ... First, they're being lied to, but what little information you get like the various committees on secrecy and defense, I mean, they have bodies of knowledge that they should just as a matter of course release to the American people, and that would begin to alter this paradigm that we accept as a nation that we can be lied to by our politicians wantonly, and nothing is ever done about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. That's one comment I wanted to add, and I want to add to him also, he was saying it, but I want to say it more clearly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. The Defense Department has never been auditable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. You can't audit it, and it's wishful thinking that you think that they'll ever get to that because it's convenient to not audit what's going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. The other is I want to add to Sheehan's comments, which of course was I'm sure a revelation to a lot of people, that here in Israel, we shipped this nuclear capability to Israel, and one of their tasks was to share it with the Shah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. Well, the adding to that is we gave the Shah an experimental nuclear reactor, which is in Tehran today, and the plan for that reactor was to be able to build bombs that would be under the control of the Shah or under the control of the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. What had happened after the revolution, and this is what most Americans don't know right now, is that it was the Ayatollah Khomeini who made the decision that that reactor would not be used for any nuclear devices, bomb-making devices.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. It was an internal decision by the supreme, the imam, that they would not do that because the Quran did not sanction weapons of mass destruction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. And now when you get the take by American media that, "Oh my God, they're searching for the bomb."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. We tried to give them the bomb under the Shah, and they're the ones that decided they don't want it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. It's immoral.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. I just wanted to add that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. Those are the two points that I wanted to make.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. I'll yield back the balance of my time because I can't think of an intelligent question I could ask to the intelligent testimony we just had.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. That's nice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. Congresswoman Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. Thank you very much, and again, thank you for your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. You're absolutely right, Senator.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. I think today's whole experience has been one of intelligence, higher than we're normal in our society.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. Maybe this room itself and our subject matter may have something to do with that, but we appreciate your service.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. Going back to the millions of dollars that are missing, or inaudible, or missing, in the defensive budget over several years, 2.3, Dr. Greer, I think was the number you gave, 2.3 trillion, 2.3 trillion, and that's over several years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. I know most of you know at the table that we have also passed an intelligence budget in the Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. All intelligence matters are funded in that budget, and as members of Congress, we don't debate it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. We don't know its bottom number or any of that because, quote, it's over our classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. Members of Congress are also classified to a point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. When we come in office, as you know, I'm sure we take an oath and sign for the intelligence level that we can hear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. Of course, there's super, super intelligence that we don't, and I think we're discussing much of that today, which is where the money is and where that intelligence budget is gone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. You mentioned emergency and everything we talked about today, and my newspaper person came up to me this ... I told them I'll speak to them on Friday after I learn more, but they still keep coming.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. I don't usually speak unless I know something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. I'm trying to learn, so I don't have much to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. You mentioned that it's emergency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. It's emergency now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. Several other speakers this morning mentioned that they're here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. They're not the only ones here, and that God is the universe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. I just believe there's got to be a whole lot of other things that we don't yet know, and will soon, hopefully.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. Is there an emergency?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. What happens if we do nothing?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. What ought we do?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. How should we do it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. Well, I think that there's a wonderful Chinese saying, "Unless we change directions, we're likely to end up where we're going."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. The point is, if you look at the trend lines of where our civilization's going, the intractable mess we have in the Middle East, and of course, when we say national security interests in the Middle East, it means oil.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. As pointed out, Israel has about 200 or 300 thermonuclear weapons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. They can take care of themselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. Why are we still on oil?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. I think we're on oil, and coal, and nuclear power, because there has been an active longitude and a long-term suppression of really advanced sciences and technologies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. I think that this has created both a geopolitical emergency and a geophysical emergency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. Whether you believe in global warming or not, you cannot have seven billion people burning oil, and gas, and coal indefinitely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. What are going to be the solutions?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. Now, my farm in Virginia runs on solar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Luckily, I was, I guess, affluent enough to put in a huge solar farm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. It's the biggest private solar farm in Virginia, but it's not practical for most people, whereas there are advanced technologies dealing with the physics of zero-point energy, so that every home and car would have a generator pulling energy out of the fabric of space-time, and you would never have to burn another drop of oil.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. Why are we not there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. Why are we not doing that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. Because there has been active suppression of this information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. As Mr. Sheehan reported, there are people on my team who have been threatened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. There is a man working on one of these devices for my group.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. We provided some grant funding, and about two or three years ago, a former CIA director, who I don't want to talk about, with a group of people went down there and threatened him and his wife if he didn't stop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. So this is a man who is attached to IT&T and does contract work for the CIA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. He had been clear to do it for us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. Why then?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. Wait, doctor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. If people have been, what was that word?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. He was threatened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. Threatened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. Threatened, near-death, exercise, eliminated, or whatever that means.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. Why then are we talking to you today, and how are you so healthy today?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. Any of them is threatening you, or are you just strong?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. I'm strong.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. And we have a lot of good friends, and there are folks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. People mentioned Dr. Ron Pandolfi at the CIA, and I did spend a lot of time with Lawrence Rockefeller.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. There are a lot of people who have supported what we're trying to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. There are a lot of people who are opposed to what we're trying to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. There is a committee, it used to be called Majestic, that deals with this issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. And I will give the committee a document, this document I refer to, and the second one down is Cosmic Ops, and the third one is Magic Ops and Magi Ops.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. You know how important that would be if we had it in front of us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. Which is my point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. We're going to get it for you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. We need all of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. We need your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. It helps us prepare.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. And when you refer to things, we can see it as well as hear it, and it's internalized better.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. I appreciate it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. And we have a computer disk we'll give each of you that has all of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. What's key about the document, however, is that these compartmented operations that are known to exist work mainly in the science and technology area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. And this particular document is from the National Reconnaissance Office, and it was a security breach warning for Nellis Air Force Base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. And of course, we would only need things that we can see legally, you know, whichever classifications we are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. You may have something that you cannot share, and that's okay, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. Well, no, I don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. Actually, everything that we have, even if -- we have determined, as I said through the unless otherwise directed order that we sent out a letter, that all of this information is declassified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. Because we have determined that the secrecy has been maintained outside a proper constitutional -- look, I met personally with the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency for a very long period of time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. He was given information, actionable intelligence, and he, along -- as well as Admiral Wilson, and this man is General Patrick Hughes, and many of you may have known him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. He was denied access.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. That has got to be illegal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. You cannot be denying senior people who are in the chain of command.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. And so -- Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. You have to stop there, because my minute is up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. But just thank you for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. And we want to work with you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. We want the information -- Thank you. -- in writing, as well as verbally, and I yield back the balance of my time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. You'll get all of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. This is all for you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. [Applause.]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. Congressman Cook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. I'd like to continue with Dr. Greer for a moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. You talked about 14 countries that have opened up UFO files, and I take it that these are probably similar to files that the United States has that the United States government has refused to open up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. Am I right in that implication?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. To clarify, those are the documents that would be available within those governments that are not in an unacknowledged special access project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. Great Britain, for example, has recently opened up a large number of files, but those are the ones that can be obtained by a FOIA-type officer, same thing in France.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. There are corollaries to these unacknowledged projects in some of these other countries, which we have discovered -- Great Britain, certainly, Canada, certainly, and also France.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. But I think that what we have to understand is that they have at least been making the attempt to show interest and support for bringing out this information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. I think in South America, we've even seen more support, with some governments having offices in their ministries of defense, investigating this and releasing information almost in real time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. So I think we're seeing more disclosure in some of these other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. The United States has been the most recalcitrant.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. You've indicated, as we've just talked about, the $2.3 trillion that you said is completely missing from the Department of Defense budget over, what, a couple decades?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. Well, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld didn't comment on how long.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. Now, Secretary of Defense Cohen -- I think most of you may have known him during the Clinton years -- he was given information also from Gordon Cooper, one of our witnesses who was an astronaut, and he also said, "Look, I've looked into this, and there's a great deal of activity, but they won't share it with me," from the secretary of defense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. So yeah, but that $2.3 trillion, we don't know quite where it's going.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. Okay, but when you say that we don't know quite where it's going, is it part of that or all of that or some of that, the unacknowledged special access processes that you talk about?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. Projects yet, USABs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. Projects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. Unacknowledged special access projects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. Projects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. Those, yes, by definition, if the secretary of defense keeps tracking -- So a lot of that $2.3 trillion is those?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. Over several decades, and we estimate it's between, at this point, $100 billion and $200 billion a year.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. That would give us universal health care, by the way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. And I'm not defending any of this part, but look -- [applause] I'm not defending this aspect of it, but if $2.3 trillion is, in fact, the unacknowledged special access project, is that what you're saying?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. Apparently, if the secretary of defense -- Well, that's not really -- oh, you're saying it could be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. You just don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. We think it is, and in fact, I believe that's what he was saying over a number of years, many years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. If we have counted in those projects things like anti-gravity machines, things like space elevators that are based on anti-gravity research and magnetism and electricity that goes far beyond any of us are really totally aware of right now, or some may be, or I can think of a number of things, but here's my question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. And I want you to really give me your best possible feeling on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. Is some of that clearly, legitimately, withheld for national security reasons?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. In fact, I was approached by some folks after Obama was elected to support an initiative to privately bring out the lifter or electromagnetic gravitics, and I said because they could become a delivery system, and I was meeting with an Air Force colonel at the time, I think that some of that needs to be looked at very carefully.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. However, the stationary energy generation systems that would get us off oil, gas, and coal tomorrow, those should be brought out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. So I think that -- Of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. So I think you do have to have a very -- and I'm saying this, and I know there are people who probably in the disclosure movement are going to be appalled by what I'm about to say -- is that we do not yet live in a world where everyone on the planet should have a lifter and transfer transportation system that could get us from here to Paris in two or three minutes, and I think that those sort of technologies obviously have weapons delivery applications.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

484. However, the part of the technology that deals with energy generation should come out and has also been suppressed for reasons mainly of macroeconomic stability, because as you know, part of the national security discussion has always been these would be highly disruptive technologies, to which I say, well, good, you want to be disrupted now or later when we go through a terminus with the environment melting down around us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. We have got to make these hard decisions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. Okay, well, then my last question to you, Dr. Greer, would be these 14 countries that are disclosing, or at least making it possible for the people in those countries and people around the world to know what's in those files, is it possible that one of the reasons they may be motivated over the United States is because they think some of this stuff that's being seen and this phenomena, the maneuvering that's been talked about, the maneuvering that defies the laws of physics, might be something the United States is testing, that the United States just refuses to talk about?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. They do know that that's the case, and in fact, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. In fact, in the French government, we've had discussions about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. They know that some of these objects have extraterrestrial origin.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. They know that some of them are man-made, and the Lockheed Skunk Works and some of my witnesses and sources work in the famous Skunk Works, and I will tell you that Ben Rich, who headed up the Lockheed Skunk Works, said before he died, and we have a witness to this comment that we "already have the technologies to take ET home."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

492. In other words, we already have at the Skunk Works interstellar-capable technologies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. Thank you, Ms. Scherer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. Thank you, first of all, for your testimony, it's been incredibly interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. When you have other countries opening up, is there any reason that we shouldn't do the same, at least to the extent that they're doing?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. We talked about, or you talked about some restrictions at places that we might not want to go for actually really good reasons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. Is there any reason that we shouldn't open up as much as some of the other countries have done?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

499. No, there's not, and in fact, I think that in reality, the secrecy undermines our democracy, and my mom's family were some of the original founders of the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

500. They were the first, well, we say the losers, who got caught by the British and were thrown in prison, so we were the first POWs, and my family and many of us, and my uncle who worked at Northrop Grumman, are appalled at the illegality of the secrecy and the ruthlessness with which it's been enforced, and those of us who've gone through that buzzsaw, and I've gone through a fair amount of it, it is not pretty, and what I would say is that this really does undermine our whole concept of a free society.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. It also undermines the credibility of government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

502. This was one of my key points that I made to Mr. Rockefeller and to the Clinton administration, is that when you have almost 60 percent of the public believing this is real and some part of the government's hiding it, it makes a laughing stock when the Air Force has trotted out to say everything's a weather balloon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

503. It's just as ridiculous, so the more we can release, the better, and I think the technology end of it needs to at least be released at the level where we would be able to have practical applications and sort of a peace dividend and an environmental dividend to this $2.3 trillion that are unaccounted for in the Department of Defense, and that certainly ought to happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. [Applause]

## Speaker Group 2

505. I, too, was appalled when I sat on the Budget Committee and found out that the Defense Department was the only department that can't get through an audit, and the point I used to push with the Budget Committee was, "Well, let's get started someplace."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. I mean, take a department, take a segment of a department, anything to begin to understand how the military spends its budget.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. Do you think that, with what they do and much of the secrecy they work under, whether it's legitimate or not, do you think that's ever possible?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

508. Well, I think, you know, we would have to make a concerted effort, and I have to tell you, the look of fear, and I'm being very honest here, the fear and the anger I saw in the faces of General Patrick Hughes and Admiral Wilson when we provided the information that I'm going to provide for you, and which was provided to these people, as well as C.I.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

509. Director Woolsey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. It was palpable, because they realized that there was this very deep secret national security state that even they, who are supposed to be looking out after our best interests, were being denied access to, and when I asked the Admiral, Admiral Wilson, the head of intelligence joint staff, to please try to get control of this, he looked at me, he says, "My understanding now is that the best thing I have is a B2 stealth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. What this secret organization has are things that can do circles around it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. I'm outgunned."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. He also said that until the civilian leaders of the government order him to do something, the Secretary of Defense and the President, he can only do so much, but we couldn't get President Clinton to lean into this for reasons, well, I don't know if I want to even go into that, but it's for security reasons, safety reasons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. So I think that this is the sort of problem you run into, and General Patrick Hughes went over to a shelf, now this is the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, huge, and he said, "This is all I've ever gotten from the Defense Intelligence Agency chain of command in my inquiries into this subject," and he had a little ET doll brought at a toy store, and we all laughed but wanted to cry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. So here you have a general and an admiral and a CIA director, and these people were not just picking my brain trying to figure out what I knew, they honestly were being denied access.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. How can this be?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. How can it be?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

518. Well, that's what I found in the hearing when I asked about how do we get to that place where they can go through an audit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. It was, I mean, it was sort of a big joke, like, "Well, we're never going to be able to do that," so there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

520. One of the reasons is this, and this is going to have to get reformed somehow, I know an auditor for my uncle's old company, Northrop Grumman, he said, "Basically, if you're dealing with one of these unacknowledged projects, they will tell you, 'Well, we have an undisclosed amount of money doing an undisclosed project, and you don't have a need to know,' and they will then just rubber-stamp what's going into Northrop Grumman, or Lockheed Martin, or Science Applications International Corporation, or MITRE Corporation."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. Now, I have a whole list.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. One of the sections in here that I will provide for you, and Congressman Christopher Cox, who later became Bush's head of the SEC, asked me to put this together for him, and it's a list of the facilities and corporations and sub-corporations and sub-facilities where this activity is going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. This is actionable intelligence if anyone wants to follow up on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. So yes, you can find out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. We have found out, but it's something that would have to be a concerted effort under subpoena power by people who would not take no for an answer, and that I think the people deserve.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

527. Well, this is virtually the end of this panel, and the next one is about ready to start, but I always have things that kind of hang in the air, because nothing we're learning is going to make any difference if we can't do anything about it, if we don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

528. And in 1995, the Rockefeller-funded conference in Asilomar, my question, as you were talking about it, was, well, what were their goals?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. What did they accomplish?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

530. And did anything really happen because of that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. And what we're doing today, this many years later, is there enough different out there that we can make a difference this week?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. Yes, ma'am, it's part of a process, and that meeting was a meeting to get together the initial governmental witnesses and to create a support group for them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. I had grown men, old enough to be my grandfather, cry on my shoulder and say, "We've been wanting to talk about this our whole lives," who were astronauts, who were cosmonauts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. I said, "Okay, let's do that," but they were afraid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. They had signed oaths saying that they would never talk about any of this stuff, and they were afraid, and some of them had been in unacknowledged projects where they were told they would be terminated, killed, if they talked about it, and this is true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. So it was a process, and what I wanted to have happen, in 1997, when we had the meetings for various members of Congress, we had hoped that members of Congress who were chair of committees would pick up this mantle.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. I'm still working full-time as an emergency doctor with four daughters and a golden retriever, and I have a life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. I was doing this as a sort of a voluntary thing, but unfortunately, no one really wanted to pick this up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

539. But I think that if we come together as a people, we can do it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. Now, with this process, there's the possibility of galvanizing a larger movement, because I think if the people will lead, the leaders will have to follow, but we have to get the information that we have out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. But I think that to the extent that you folks could influence some of your colleagues who are still in the Congress to take a serious interest in this, that isn't just a dog-and-pony show of denial and ridicule, but really drills down on the, again, actionable intelligence that we've put together over the last 15 years, I think that that would result to really the lid coming off this thing and the people knowing the truth once and for all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

542. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. And now we're going to change panels. [applause]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
