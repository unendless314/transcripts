  source_text: Okay, well, then my last question to you, Dr. Greer, would be these 14 countries that are disclosing, or at
    least making it possible for the people in those countries and people around the world to know what's in those files,
    is it possible that one of the reasons they may be motivated over the United States is because they think some of this
    stuff that's being seen and this phenomena, the maneuvering that's been talked about, the maneuvering that defies the
    laws of physics, might be something the United States is testing, that the United States just refuses to talk about?

    things that kind of hang in the air, because nothing we're learning is going to make any difference if we can't do anything
    about it, if we don't.

    Congress to take a serious interest in this, that isn't just a dog-and-pony show of denial and ridicule, but really drills
    down on the, again, actionable intelligence that we've put together over the last 15 years, I think that that would result
    to really the lid coming off this thing and the people knowing the truth once and for all.
