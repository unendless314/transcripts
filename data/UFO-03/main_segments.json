[{"segment_id":1,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we'll begin with the two witnesses that are here."},{"segment_id":2,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you would be so kind as to repeat after me, I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth to the members of this committee today."},{"segment_id":3,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you both."},{"segment_id":4,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we're going to begin with Dr. Greer."},{"segment_id":5,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":6,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's an honor to be here."},{"segment_id":7,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I would just like to summarize this subject by saying that I got involved in 1990 when I formed the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and put together some of the early briefings for folks in the administration of President Clinton."},{"segment_id":8,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This occurred because in 1992 I was leading a team of people where we had a contact event on a beach in Florida."},{"segment_id":9,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And this got reported into a Department of Defense memo or report that was done by John Peterson at the Arlington Institute."},{"segment_id":10,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he was friends with the man who became CIA Director Woolsey."},{"segment_id":11,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"CIA Director Woolsey invited us to come to Washington to meet with him and some folks to discuss this."},{"segment_id":12,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it was to my great surprise and dismay to learn that the CIA Director had made inquiries into this subject and had not gotten any information."},{"segment_id":13,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This was also true of President Clinton who, through Webster Hubbell, had also made inquiries."},{"segment_id":14,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because of this, we decided to put together an initiative which was called Project Starlight and it was very much involved in the early days with briefing senior people in the military and government."},{"segment_id":15,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And to my dismay, I have to say at this point that we discovered that there was an extra constitutional management of this subject, which continues to this moment, which I find, as Eisenhower said, an existential threat to our democracy."},{"segment_id":16,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's for that reason, a few years ago I left my medical career to pursue this and to get the truth out to the public because I feel it's a matter of very pressing concern."},{"segment_id":17,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm an emergency doctor and I always kind of halfway jokingly say I know an emergency when I see one and our planet and our government is in an emergency."},{"segment_id":18,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"During the period around the time we had our meetings with Mr. Rockefeller, I had already set up briefings through the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Wilson, meeting at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to which the remains of the Roswell event was sent."},{"segment_id":19,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They initially did not want to have this meeting."},{"segment_id":20,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was ordered by the head of Air Force intelligence under the orders of J2, which as you know is head of intelligence, joint staff, Admiral Kramer."},{"segment_id":21,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That then led to a series of events where we decided what we needed to do was pull together the best military, intelligence, and corporate, Lockheed, Northrop, and other witnesses as we call them, to this issue and begin to do briefings for various members of Congress and people in the administration."},{"segment_id":22,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In 1995, I organized, and Mr. Rockefeller funded, a gathering of the first of witnesses at Asilomar near Monterey in California."},{"segment_id":23,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These were people, they were cosmonauts, they were from Russia, they were astronauts such as Edgar Mitchell, they were people who had worked with Eisenhower and knew of Eisenhower's concern that he had lost control over the secrecy on this issue around 1956."},{"segment_id":24,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Then ironically, the Rockefeller commission reorganized the Department of Defense and the CIA into such a Byzantine mess that to this day these projects have not had proper oversight at that level."},{"segment_id":25,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This then led to us doing some meetings for members of Congress."},{"segment_id":26,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We did in 1997, and Congressman Dan Burton, who was chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee came, along with a number of other congressmen and senators, and also following that, we did what's called a stand-up briefing, Edgar Mitchell and I did, the Sixth Man to Walk on the Moon, with some of our military sources for then head of intelligence joint staff, Admiral Tom Wilson."},{"segment_id":27,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"To my astonishment, when I had this meeting, I had sent in advance a briefing similar to the one that I provided here, this is the one I provided for President Obama."},{"segment_id":28,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What I was astonished and appalled to learn is that the first document that I have in this document is a National Reconnaissance Office document that has actionable intelligence listing project code names and code numbers, effective as of the early '90s."},{"segment_id":29,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This Admiral, Tom Wilson, looked through this document, identified one of the compartments, contacted them and was told, and I'm quoting, \"Sir, you do not have a need to know.\""},{"segment_id":30,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he said to the person, it was a contractor, I cannot disclose which one, he said that basically, \"Sir, we will not discuss this with you further,\" and basically hung up on the Admiral."},{"segment_id":31,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because of that event, we then wrote a unless otherwise directed letter."},{"segment_id":32,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My military advisor said, \"Dr. Greer, what you need to do is do a UNOD letter that goes to all branches of government that says that we have concluded that this subject is being managed in an extra-constitutional fashion."},{"segment_id":33,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"A priori, the National Security Act no longer applies to those under those, and they are hereby exonerated or freed from them.\""},{"segment_id":34,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We wrote such a letter to the heads of all agencies."},{"segment_id":35,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was never contested, and the way unless otherwise directed letter works is that unless you hear back from the agency, you are allowed to proceed with your assessment, and our assessment was that we were going to go forward with these men and women and documents."},{"segment_id":36,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In fact, there was a senior CIA official who I have been asked not to name who is still in the science directorate of the CIA who said, \"Please do this for our nation.\""},{"segment_id":37,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At that point, we began to gather together more of these so-called witnesses."},{"segment_id":38,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They've been called now."},{"segment_id":39,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I call them patriots who want to have the truth out."},{"segment_id":40,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We then did the 2001 disclosure project in this ballroom, and we're about at our 12-year anniversary of that, and I organized that for the purpose of getting the public informed and also Congress."},{"segment_id":41,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There were tens of thousands of petitions sent to members of Congress in faxes asking for hearings."},{"segment_id":42,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Unfortunately, a few months later, 9/11 happened."},{"segment_id":43,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The day before 9/11, September 10th, that there was a memo from a comment, I should say, in a speech by then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld who stated that there is $2.3 trillion unaccounted for in the Department of Defense budget."},{"segment_id":44,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let me repeat that number, $2.3 trillion."},{"segment_id":45,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This was on September 10th, 2001."},{"segment_id":46,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, prior to that, I was not surprised at that comment because back in 1994, I had a meeting with Mr. DeMato, not the senator, who was the chief counsel for the Senate Appropriations Committee, and he informed me that they felt that there was upwards of or in excess of $900 billion a year missing out of the Treasury going into so-called black projects."},{"segment_id":47,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, this is a misnomer, just so that the committee knows, the proper term in the military and intelligence world is an unacknowledged special access project."},{"segment_id":48,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, special access projects are projects that, of course, you have to be read into with various clearances."},{"segment_id":49,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The unacknowledged ones are ones for which there is no acknowledgment on paper, and anyone in the project is ordered not to speak about it under threat of termination with extreme prejudice, which is death."},{"segment_id":50,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My senior military advisor was in one such project."},{"segment_id":51,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He has not even informed me what it concerned."},{"segment_id":52,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was under Admiral Harry Train."},{"segment_id":53,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was a $3 billion project."},{"segment_id":54,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is one project that was unacknowledged."},{"segment_id":55,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So this is not a theory."},{"segment_id":56,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is how the deep national security state actually operates that the members of Congress usually are not aware of."},{"segment_id":57,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, in the ensuing year, since 2001, we have continued these briefings."},{"segment_id":58,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've had greater success in other countries."},{"segment_id":59,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There are now more than 14 countries that have opened their UFO files."},{"segment_id":60,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've been very instrumental in this."},{"segment_id":61,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've worked with people at the Vatican, the French government, and what is also very exciting is that one of the most important documents in history, which I'll provide to the committee, is a document from the Ministry of Defense of France committing to my organization to engage in a long-term project to make peaceful contact with these \"visitors.\""},{"segment_id":62,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This document has not been yet released."},{"segment_id":63,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I will provide it to the committee, and there is great progress being made in other countries."},{"segment_id":64,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Admiral Moran, who won the Ampere Prize in France and is an MD, as I am, and also a PhD physicist, and has been an advisor and was an advisor to President Sarkozy and others, has been meeting with us and we have been involved with projects in other countries to do this."},{"segment_id":65,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I will tell you, however, that as they began to step into this, they were warned off by someone within the national security state saying, \"Do not pursue this.\""},{"segment_id":66,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We went to France about two years, three years ago, and we had an expedition to actually make contact with these extraterrestrial civilizations."},{"segment_id":67,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The admiral later informed us that their radar tracked objects that came over the site at between 100,000 and 200,000 kilometers an hour."},{"segment_id":68,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, what is fascinating about this is that the French were not deterred from doing this project with us, but they have to date remained fairly quiet."},{"segment_id":69,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There is, therefore, progress being made in other G7 countries."},{"segment_id":70,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As you know, we have a former Minister of Defense of Canada here who is very supportive, the Honorable Paul Hellyer, and what we find, however, is that the United States has remained a black hole of secrecy."},{"segment_id":71,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, the reason for this is complex."},{"segment_id":72,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of the reasons is inertia."},{"segment_id":73,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Once you go into an unacknowledged special access project, it's very hard to bring things out."},{"segment_id":74,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Number two is that this is the crown jewel in America of the defense industry and the aerospace industry."},{"segment_id":75,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My uncle was a senior project engineer at Grumman that became Northrop Grumman that put the first man on the moon with the lunar module."},{"segment_id":76,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He worked on the lunar module, which is part of how I got involved with this."},{"segment_id":77,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What I have found through my uncle and other contacts at Lockheed is that we have had since about the mid-1950s operational electromagnetic-gravitic devices, basically in parlance of the pop culture anti-gravity devices, that are deeply classified and are the next generation beyond rockets and jet aircraft."},{"segment_id":78,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These are fully operational and not experimental."},{"segment_id":79,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These have been used very discreetly."},{"segment_id":80,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have an enormous amount of information on this, including a facility, Norton Air Force Base, where we had Frank Carlucci, the Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan, was ushered in there, and some people who were with him, such as Brad Sorensen, have given us information and actually have helped us provide schematics and drawings for these so-called alien reproduction vehicles, a bit of a misnomer because in reality advanced anti-gravity research began with T. Townsend Brown in 1929."},{"segment_id":81,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We will get more into this on Friday."},{"segment_id":82,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The key point here is that the technologies that would give us a new civilization without oil, without gas, without coal, without nuclear power are extant."},{"segment_id":83,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They already exist, they've been developed, and it is a matter of the utmost national security and world peace and justice that we bring these sciences out and start a new chapter in the human experience."},{"segment_id":84,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":85,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Daniel."},{"segment_id":86,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'd like to address the issue from the point of view of a practicing attorney in these particular areas."},{"segment_id":87,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I just touched on it briefly earlier in the other panel that when I was at the Cahill Gordon law firm in New York, we were brought the Pentagon Papers at that time, and Jim Goodell, the chief counsel for the New York Times contacted us."},{"segment_id":88,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I had been working on the briefs for the New York Times because I happened to have initiated the case that established the right of journalists to protect their confidential news sources when I was at the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review."},{"segment_id":89,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I was at the firm and was working on the briefs, and Jim Goodell brought us the information that they had the Pentagon Papers, and so it was the first time that I found myself in a situation where I had to kind of try to put myself in the shoes of people that I had the luxury prior to that time of just saying, \"We ought to get it all out."},{"segment_id":90,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We ought to just reveal everything."},{"segment_id":91,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We ought to tell all the people have a right to know everything.\""},{"segment_id":92,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I found myself in this peculiar situation of starting to ask questions about what might be in there that we had to try to be careful about revealing."},{"segment_id":93,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now in that particular case, it wasn't a hard question because we found things about the assassination program of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Phoenix program."},{"segment_id":94,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We found out that they were smuggling opium in Southeast Asia to help fund it."},{"segment_id":95,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We found out about the Nugan Hand Bank that was set up by Theodore Shackley, who was the CIA station chief in Saigon."},{"segment_id":96,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All the things that we found out about in that particular instance I felt were criminal conduct, unlawful conduct."},{"segment_id":97,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it had occurred because the Central Intelligence Agency, when it was created in 1947, was out of Section 5412, the 5412 committee was set up inside the National Security Council to actually oversee covert operations."},{"segment_id":98,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For the first time, it actually legitimized the undertaking of covert operations that were not going to be revealed to the Congress."},{"segment_id":99,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was before we had an intelligence committee."},{"segment_id":100,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You remember that Prescott Bush, the United States Senator from Connecticut, was the one who would brief in certain Congress people and certain senators about this."},{"segment_id":101,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So there was this entire kind of extra constitutional process or protocols that began to be undertaken right at the very beginning."},{"segment_id":102,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Finally, they set up the 5412 committee inside the National Security Council that oversaw those things."},{"segment_id":103,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And as I said, I had never had access to that until we saw the Pentagon Papers, and on reviewing it with Neil Sheehan and the others, I came to the conclusion that all of this should be revealed, that these were criminal activities that had happened that were all happening outside of the United States, but they were having such dramatic effects inside the United States that I thought they ought to be talked about."},{"segment_id":104,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But that was my first experience with this."},{"segment_id":105,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As it proceeded, I ended up becoming chief counsel in the Karen Silkwood case, the woman that was killed out in Oklahoma at the nuclear site out there."},{"segment_id":106,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And during our investigations of that, we discovered that 98 pounds of bomb-grade plutonium were being smuggled out of the Kerr-McGee nuclear facility, the reprocessing plant, and we discovered that it was actually being transported secretly to Israel."},{"segment_id":107,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I touched on that old third rail."},{"segment_id":108,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There it was, and we went and we briefed Peter Stockton."},{"segment_id":109,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was the chief investigator for John Dingell."},{"segment_id":110,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"John Dingell was chairing the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, and because of the oversight of authority they had over nuclear facilities environmentally, we briefed them and told them all about this, and they actually set up a -- they tasked a real-time national security agency satellite to actually monitor the smuggling of these materials and actually track them onto being put on charter oil company ships and then boarded by Mossad and brought to Israel, and at that time they were under the condition that they had to share some of the special nuclear materials, 98 percent pure bomb-grade plutonium, that they had to share them with the Shah of Iran."},{"segment_id":111,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So that they actually were providing 98 percent pure bomb-grade plutonium, reprocessed plutonium to the Shah of Iran and to South Africa, the Afrikaner government."},{"segment_id":112,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now because of my discovery of that, it was a clear absolute blatant violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and so I briefed the judge."},{"segment_id":113,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We had the Judge Theis, Frank G. Theis, was the chief counsel -- was the judge on that case."},{"segment_id":114,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I provided a memorandum to him, an affidavit to him explaining the whole thing, and the following Monday he contacted me and said the Central Intelligence Agency had contacted him and wanted to have an in-camera ex parte meeting with him, and he met with them and immediately dismissed one of the counts in our case, in the Karen Silkwood case, the whole -- her death on the highway."},{"segment_id":115,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The whole interfering with her right to travel on the highway, her First Amendment right to meet with the New York Times, because David Burnham was waiting for her at the Holiday Inn to receive the documents showing that these -- it was 40 pounds, 98 percent pure platinum grade plutonium was missing."},{"segment_id":116,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And when we gave that information to the congressman, nobody ever talked about it after that."},{"segment_id":117,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They called Stansfield Turner in, they brought him downstairs, put him under oath, challenged him about this, and the only reason I knew about it was because Peter Stockton told us about it."},{"segment_id":118,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So it became obvious again to me at that point that there were secrets that virtually everybody agreed within the political circles had to be kept secret, and this supplying -- our supplying in complete violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, 98 percent bomb grade plutonium to Israel was one of those things."},{"segment_id":119,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so I realized that at that time there were these -- there was this dimension, such as Dr. Greer has talked about, there are levels of classification that are way beyond people in the congress, way beyond us as civilians, but I spent a lot of time looking into this whole process."},{"segment_id":120,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And as you know, I was the one that filed the original Iran-Contra case that got the special prosecutor appointed."},{"segment_id":121,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We uncovered all the smuggling of the weapons that were going on, the cocaine smuggling operations that were going on."},{"segment_id":122,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It became clear to me that everybody knew about this, that all kinds of people knew about this going on, but the citizens didn't."},{"segment_id":123,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And as I tried to bring information to some people in congress and the senate, et cetera, talked with Tip O'Neill about all of this, and we -- as I discovered all this stuff was going on, I was then later contacted by Dr. John Mack, as I told you, to represent him, and I was aware of the fact that there was this realm of ultimate secrecy that existed."},{"segment_id":124,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I realized that there was a classification above everything that I'd ever seen that was cosmic, a cosmic top secret."},{"segment_id":125,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's a whole category of cosmic top secret that has to do with this particular category, and that there's information in there about contacts with these beings that were recovered from Roswell, a living being, one particular living being that they brought to Wright-Patterson, that they didn't know what to do with the being, they didn't know how to take care of the being, they had to keep the being isolated, but they were afraid of potential contamination."},{"segment_id":126,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I was challenged at that point to try to determine whether or not I would reveal these things to everyone."},{"segment_id":127,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I kept trying to have contact with people inside the intelligence community to say look, if there's something that you think I ought to know that would convince me that the American people somehow shouldn't know about this, tell me about it, will you?"},{"segment_id":128,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because if you're not going to tell me about it, I can tell you I'm going after it, and I'm going to be going after it in a context that may make it automatically available to anybody once I get it."},{"segment_id":129,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And only a couple of times have I ever approached and said to stay away from these things."},{"segment_id":130,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well that's not an answer, just to stay away from it."},{"segment_id":131,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so what I've done is I'm just coming to you today to tell you that with my experience directly as one of the attorneys in the Pentagon Papers case, I was in F. Lee Bailey's office when we did the Watergate burglary."},{"segment_id":132,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was our office that got McCord to write the letter to Judge Sirica, blowing the whistle on the Watergate plumbers, the Karen Silkwood case with the smuggling of the plutonium, the Iran-Contra case with all of the smuggling of cocaine that was going on."},{"segment_id":133,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But nothing matches this issue."},{"segment_id":134,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Nothing comes close to matching this issue."},{"segment_id":135,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because the reality of it is, is that because whatever this extraterrestrial intelligence is, they obviously share the belief that somehow we shouldn't be just told right straight outright."},{"segment_id":136,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As people have said, why don't they land on the White House lawn and just tell us?"},{"segment_id":137,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So there is obviously some type of consensus that exists at the highest levels of the security, cosmic, top-secret clearance in our government."},{"segment_id":138,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And when I asked Gorbachev about this, because I was legal counsel to the State of the World Forum for Gorbachev and Senator Baker at the end of the Cold War, he told me flat out that these things existed and that they'd known that these existed and they were in communication with the United States government about this."},{"segment_id":139,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So what I'm saying is that we need to as citizens be insistent upon finding out about this unless and until somebody communicates information to us that makes sense as to why it is that people all shouldn't know about this."},{"segment_id":140,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And they haven't told me that yet, and so until they do, I'm going to continue to try to find out everything I can about it and share it with people who've had the kind of responsible positions that you have had in your lives and still have in your lives."},{"segment_id":141,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because the reality is you still have political capital, whether you're 87 years old or 39 years old or whatever your ages are now, that you still have political capital that can effectuate a change and that for you to go collectively to sit down with certain members of Congress or certain people together to say, \"Look, this is what we know and we want to act responsibly."},{"segment_id":142,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Can you please help us act responsibly, but we're going to act in any event?\""},{"segment_id":143,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's how you will find out, I believe."},{"segment_id":144,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Mr.

38 years."},{"segment_id":147,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've spent most of my time looking at what the highest levels of U.S. government, military and intelligence agencies know about the UFO

noted here that, like the documents you were talking about this morning, the Roswell documents that disappeared, these documents have now disappeared."},{"segment_id":151,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Both the National Archives and the Clinton Library both maintain they do not have the documents."},{"segment_id":152,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For example, I filed an FOIAA with the Clinton Library."},{"segment_id":153,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I received about 1,000 pages of UFO documents, which included an awful lot of material that Stephen Greer had said to the President."},{"segment_id":154,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The 1,000 pages that I'm going to talk about right now were not part of the disclosure, and both maintain that they don't have them."},{"segment_id":155,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They are on my website, the President's UFO

have a very -- and I'm saying this, and I know there are people who probably in the disclosure movement are going to be appalled by what I'm about to say -- is that we do not yet live in a world where everyone on the planet should have a lifter and transfer transportation system that could get us from here to Paris in two or three minutes, and I think that those sort of technologies obviously have weapons delivery applications."},{"segment_id":484,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"However, the part of the technology that deals with energy generation should come out and has also been suppressed

decisions."},{"segment_id":486,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, well, then my last question to you, Dr. Greer, would be these 14 countries that are disclosing, or at least making it possible for the people in those countries and people around the world to know what's in those files, is it possible that one of the reasons they may be motivated over the United States is because they think some of this stuff that's being seen and this phenomena, the maneuvering that's been talked about, the maneuvering that defies the laws of physics, might be something the United States is testing, that the

shouldn't open up as much as some of the other countries have done?"},{"segment_id":499,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, there's not, and in fact, I think that in reality, the secrecy undermines our democracy, and my mom's family were some of the original founders of the United States."},{"segment_id":500,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They were the first, well, we say the losers, who got caught by the British and were thrown in prison, so we were the first POWs, and my family and many of us, and my uncle who worked at Northrop Grumman, are appalled at the illegality of the secrecy and the ruthlessness with which it's been enforced, and those of us who've gone through that buzzsaw, and I've gone through a fair amount of it, it is not pretty, and what I would say is that this really does undermine our whole concept of a free society."},{"segment_id":501,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It also undermines the credibility of government."},{"segment_id":502,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This was one of my key points that I made to Mr. Rockefeller and to the Clinton administration, is that when you have almost 60 percent of the public believing this is real and some part of the government's hiding it, it makes a laughing stock when the Air Force has trotted out to say everything's a weather balloon."},{"segment_id":503,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's just as ridiculous, so the more we can release, the better, and I think the technology end of it needs to at least be released at the level where we would be able to have practical applications and sort of a peace dividend and an environmental dividend to this $2.3 trillion that are unaccounted for in the Department of Defense, and that certainly ought to happen."},{"segment_id":504,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"[Applause]"},{"segment_id":505,"speaker_group":2,"source_text":"I, too, was appalled when I sat on the Budget Committee and found out that the Defense Department was the only department that can't get through an audit, and the point I used to push with the Budget Committee was, \"Well, let's get started someplace.\""},{"segment_id":506,"speaker_group":2,"source_text":"I mean, take a department, take a segment of a department, anything to begin to understand how the military spends its budget."},{"segment_id":507,"speaker_group":2,"source_text":"Do you think that, with what they do and much of the secrecy they work under, whether it's legitimate or not, do you think that's ever possible?"},{"segment_id":508,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Well, I think, you know, we would have to make a concerted effort, and I have to tell you, the look of fear, and I'm being very honest here, the fear and the anger I saw in the faces of General Patrick Hughes and Admiral Wilson when we provided the information that I'm going to provide for you, and which was provided to these people, as well as C.I."},{"segment_id":509,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Director Woolsey."},{"segment_id":510,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"It was palpable, because they realized that there was this very deep secret national security state that even they, who are supposed to be looking out after our best interests, were being denied access to, and when I asked the Admiral, Admiral Wilson, the head of intelligence joint staff, to please try to get control of this, he looked at me, he says, \"My understanding now is that the best thing I have is a B2 stealth."},{"segment_id":511,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"What this secret organization has are things that can do circles around it."},{"segment_id":512,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"I'm outgunned.\""},{"segment_id":513,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"He also said that until the civilian leaders of the government order him to do something, the Secretary of Defense and the President, he can only do so much, but we couldn't get President Clinton to lean into this for reasons, well, I don't know if I want to even go into that, but it's for security reasons, safety reasons."},{"segment_id":514,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"So I think that this is the sort of problem you run into, and General Patrick Hughes went over to a shelf, now this is the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, huge, and he said, \"This is all I've ever gotten from the Defense Intelligence Agency chain of command in my inquiries into this subject,\" and he had a little ET doll brought at a toy store, and we all laughed but wanted to cry."},{"segment_id":515,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"So here you have a general and an admiral and a CIA director, and these people were not just picking my brain trying to figure out what I knew, they honestly were being denied access."},{"segment_id":516,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"How can this be?"},{"segment_id":517,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"How can it be?"},{"segment_id":518,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Well, that's what I found in the hearing when I asked about how do we get to that place where they can go through an audit."},{"segment_id":519,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"It was, I mean, it was sort of a big joke, like, \"Well, we're never going to be able to do that,\" so there."},{"segment_id":520,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"One of the reasons is this, and this is going to have to get reformed somehow, I know an auditor for my uncle's old company, Northrop Grumman, he said, \"Basically, if you're dealing with one of these unacknowledged projects, they will tell you, 'Well, we have an undisclosed amount of money doing an undisclosed project, and you don't have a need to know,' and they will then just rubber-stamp what's going into Northrop Grumman, or Lockheed Martin, or Science Applications International Corporation, or MITRE Corporation.\""},{"segment_id":521,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Now, I have a whole list."},{"segment_id":522,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"One of the sections in here that I will provide for you, and Congressman Christopher Cox, who later became Bush's head of the SEC, asked me to put this together for him, and it's a list of the facilities and corporations and sub-corporations and sub-facilities where this activity is going on."},{"segment_id":523,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"This is actionable intelligence if anyone wants to follow up on it."},{"segment_id":524,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"So yes, you can find out."},{"segment_id":525,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"We have found out, but it's something that would have to be a concerted effort under subpoena power by people who would not take no for an answer, and that I think the people deserve."},{"segment_id":526,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":527,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Well, this is virtually the end of this panel, and the next one is about ready to start, but I always have things that kind of hang in the air, because nothing we're learning is going to make any difference if we can't do anything about it, if we don't."},{"segment_id":528,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"And in 1995, the Rockefeller-funded conference in Asilomar, my question, as you were talking about it, was, well, what were their goals?"},{"segment_id":529,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"What did they accomplish?"},{"segment_id":530,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"And did anything really happen because of that?"},{"segment_id":531,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"And what we're doing today, this many years later, is there enough different out there that we can make a difference this week?"},{"segment_id":532,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Yes, ma'am, it's part of a process, and that meeting was a meeting to get together the initial governmental witnesses and to create a support group for them."},{"segment_id":533,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"I had grown men, old enough to be my grandfather, cry on my shoulder and say, \"We've been wanting to talk about this our whole lives,\" who were astronauts, who were cosmonauts."},{"segment_id":534,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"I said, \"Okay, let's do that,\" but they were afraid."},{"segment_id":535,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"They had signed oaths saying that they would never talk about any of this stuff, and they were afraid, and some of them had been in unacknowledged projects where they were told they would be terminated, killed, if they talked about it, and this is true."},{"segment_id":536,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"So it was a process, and what I wanted to have happen, in 1997, when we had the meetings for various members of Congress, we had hoped that members of Congress who were chair of committees would pick up this mantle."},{"segment_id":537,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"I'm still working full-time as an emergency doctor with four daughters and a golden retriever, and I have a life."},{"segment_id":538,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"I was doing this as a sort of a voluntary thing, but unfortunately, no one really wanted to pick this up."},{"segment_id":539,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"But I think that if we come together as a people, we can do it."},{"segment_id":540,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Now, with this process, there's the possibility of galvanizing a larger movement, because I think if the people will lead, the leaders will have to follow, but we have to get the information that we have out."},{"segment_id":541,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"But I think that to the extent that you folks could influence some of your colleagues who are still in the Congress to take a serious interest in this, that isn't just a dog-and-pony show of denial and ridicule, but really drills down on the, again, actionable intelligence that we've put together over the last 15 years, I think that that would result to really the lid coming off this thing and the people knowing the truth once and for all."},{"segment_id":542,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":543,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":544,"speaker_group":3,"source_text":"And now we're going to change panels.
