66. At the bottom is the war office stamp, Majestic 12 Group, April 1954, image two.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. This manual has been prepared especially for Majestic 12 units. Its purpose is to present all aspects of Majestic 12 so authorized personnel will have a better understanding of the goals of the group.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. Be able to more expertly deal with unidentified flying objects, extraterrestrial technology and entities, and increase the efficiency of future operations, image three.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. Operation Majestic 12 was established by special classified presidential order on September 24, 1947, at the recommendation of Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal and Dr. Vannevar Bush, Chairman of the Joint Research and Development Board.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. Operations are carried out under a top secret research and development intelligence group, directly responsible only to the President of the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. The goals of the MJ-12 group, image four, are as follows. The recovery for scientific study of all materials and devices of a foreign or extraterrestrial manufacturer that may become available. Such material and devices will be recovered by any and all means deemed necessary by the group, the MJ-12 group.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. The recovery for scientific study of all entities and remains of entities not of terrestrial origin, which may become available through independent action by those entities or by misfortune or military action, meaning we might shoot them down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. The establishment and administration of special teams to accomplish the above operations. The establishment and administration of special secure facilities located at secret locations within the continental borders of the United States for the receiving, processing, analysis and scientific study of any and all material and entities classified as being of extraterrestrial origin by the group of the special teams.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. Establishment and administration of covert operation to be carried out in concert with central intelligence to effect the recovery for the United States of extraterrestrial technology and entities which may come down inside the territory of or fall into the possession of foreign powers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. The establishment and maintenance of absolute top secrecy concerning all the above operations. The current situation. It is considered as far as the current situation is concerned that there are few indications that these objects and their builders pose a direct threat to the security of the United States, despite the uncertainty as to their ultimate motives in coming here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. Certainly the technology possessed by these beings far surpasses anything known to modern science, yet their presence here seems to be benign, and they seem to be avoiding contact with our species, at least for the present.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. Several dead entities have been recovered along with a substantial amount of wreckage and devices from down craft, all of which are now under study at various locations. No attempt has been made by extraterrestrial entities either to contact authorities or to recover their dead counterparts of the down craft, even though one of the crashes was the result of direct military action.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. The greatest threat at this time arises from the acquisition and study of such advanced technology by foreign powers unfriendly to the United States. It is for this reason that the recovery and study of this type of material by the United States has been given such a high priority.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. Image 5. Extraterrestrial technology is defined as follows. Aircraft identified as not manufactured in the United States or any terrestrial foreign powers, including experimental military or civilian aircraft. Aircraft in this category are generally known as unidentified flying objects or UFOBs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. Such aircraft may appear as one of several shapes and configurations and exhibit extraordinary flight characteristics. Objects and devices of unknown origin or function manufactured by processes or of materials not consistent with current technology or scientific knowledge.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. Wreckage of any aircraft thought to be of extraterrestrial manufacture or origin. Such wreckage may be the results of accidents or military action. Materials that exhibit unusual or extraordinary characteristics not consistent with current technology or scientific knowledge.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. Extraterrestrial biological entities, acronym all caps E-B-E-S, are described as responsible for their development, are demonstrably different from those postulated or observed in Homo sapiens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. Next slide. Description of craft. Documented extraterrestrial craft, UFOBs, are classified in one of four categories based on general shape as follows. Elliptical or disc shape. This type of craft is of a metallic construction and dull aluminum in color.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. They have the appearance of two pie pans or shallow dishes pressed together and may have a raised dome on the top or bottom. No seams or joints are visible on the surface giving the impression of one piece construction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. Disks are estimated from 50 to 300 feet in diameter and the thickness is approximately 15% of the diameter, not including the dome, which is 30% of the disc diameter and extends another four to six feet above the main body of the disc.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. The dome may or may not include windows or ports and ports are present around the lower rim of the disc in some instances. Some disc shaped craft are equipped with lights on the top and bottom and also around the rim.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. These lights are not visible when the craft is at rest or not functioning. There are generally no visible antenna or projections. Landing gear consists of three extendable legs ending in circular landing pads. That's at least in some cases not all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. When fully extended this landing gear supports the main body two to three feet above the surface at the lowest point. A rectangular hatch is located along the equator or on the lower surface of the disc.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. There are fuselage or cigar shapes. Documented reports of this type of craft are extremely rare. Air Force radar reports indicate they are approximately 2000 feet long and 95 feet thick and apparently they do not operate in the lower atmosphere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. Very little information is available on the performance of these craft, but radar reports have indicated speeds in excess of 7000 miles per hour. They do not appear to engage in the violent and erratic maneuvers associated with the smaller types of craft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. There are ovoid or circular shapes. This type of craft is described as being shaped like an ice cream cone being rounded at the large end and tapering to a near point at the other end.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. They are approximately 30 to 40 feet long and the thick end diameter is approximately 20% of the length. There is an extremely bright light at the pointed end. There is also airfoil or triangular shape. This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of the observations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. The radar indicates an isosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings, but they are believed capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to those exceeding the performance of the previous craft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. Next slide. Description of extraterrestrial biological entities, acronym EBES. Examination of remains recovered from wreckage of UFOBs indicates that extraterrestrial biological entities may be classified into two distinct categories as follows.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. Eba type one, these entities are humanoid and might be mistaken for human beings of the oriental race have seen from a distance. They are bipedal, five foot, four inches in height and weigh 80 to 100 pounds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. Proportionally they are similar to humans, although the cranium is somewhat larger and more rounded. The skin is a pale chalky yellow in color, thick and slightly pebbled in appearance. The eyes are small wide set almond shape with brownish black irises with very large pupils.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. The whites of the eyes are not like that of humans but have a pale gray cast.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. Eba type two, these entities are... Could I interrupt you? What are you reading from again? I want to emphasize that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. The SOM 101 Majestic 12 Group Technical Operations Manual that Dr. Wood presented his reasons for why it is real. It is entitled "Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology Recovery and Disposal Top Secret Magic Eyes Only" and this was stamped April 1954, 1954 by Majestic 12 Group with the war stamp that was in use through the early 50s before the Pentagon. So this is a government document? This is a government document that was printed in 1954 and if this was printed in 1954, it was written before 1954 and that the 1947 Roswell crashes are part of what this is talking about and I was only going to conclude so that you would realize how much detail in 1954 the government of the United States had not only about the types of craft but the types of beings that we have retrieved and we have in a variety of underground facilities.
