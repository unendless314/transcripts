99. The SOM 101 Majestic 12 Group Technical Operations Manual that Dr. Wood presented his reasons for why it is real. It is entitled "Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology Recovery and Disposal Top Secret Magic Eyes Only" and this was stamped April 1954, 1954 by Majestic 12 Group with the war stamp that was in use through the early 50s before the Pentagon. So this is a government document? This is a government document that was printed in 1954 and if this was printed in 1954, it was written before 1954 and that the 1947 Roswell crashes are part of what this is talking about and I was only going to conclude so that you would realize how much detail in 1954 the government of the United States had not only about the types of craft but the types of beings that we have retrieved and we have in a variety of underground facilities.
→ {"text": "這是 SOM 1-01《Majestic 12 小組技術行動手冊》，伍德博士剛才說明了它為何是真實文件的理由。它的標題是《外星實體與科技回收處置 最高機密 Magic Eyes Only》，Majestic 12 小組於 1954 年 4 月蓋章，使用的是五角大廈建成前、1950 年代初期使用的戰爭部印章。所以這是政府文件？這是一份 1954 年印製的政府文件。如果它印製於 1954 年，那麼撰寫時間必定早於 1954 年，而 1947 年羅斯威爾墜毀事件正是其中討論的內容之一。我只想作個總結，讓各位了解在 1954 年，美國政府不僅對飛行器的類型有如此詳盡的資訊，對我們已回收並保存在各地地下設施中的存有類型也有同樣詳細的了解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "SOM 101 依照術語表譯為 SOM 1-01；Roswell 依照術語表譯為羅斯威爾事件"}
