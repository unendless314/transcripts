## Speaker Group 1

243. Dr. Wood, I'm particularly interested in PhDs in physics from places like Cornell.
→ {"text": "伍德博士，我對康乃爾大學這類學府的物理學博士特別感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. You're obviously a very intelligent person and someone not easily fooled.
→ {"text": "您顯然是一位非常聰明的人，不容易被愚弄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. There's no doubt in your mind that the documents that you've helped with, Mr. Friedman, there's just no question.
→ {"text": "您心中對於這些您協助驗證的文件毫無疑問，佛烈德曼先生也是，完全沒有質疑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. And you've, I think, written a very credible statement here that these are authentic.
→ {"text": "而且我認為您在這裡撰寫了一份非常可信的聲明，證明這些文件是真實的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. Okay, and as a very capable person, when the top page of the document file, and the 28 pages you say were involved in this, and again, we're talking, I think what I'm understanding is that what you've authenticated is the majestic 12, which has been known as the majestic 12 stuff, which resulted in this particular.
→ {"text": "好的，作為一位非常有能力的人，當我看到這份文件檔案的首頁，以及您所說涉及的這 28 頁，我再次確認，我的理解是您所驗證的是 Majestic 12，也就是眾所周知的 Majestic 12 相關資料，這導致了這份特定文件的產生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. If you could just clarify that for me if I've got that wrong.
→ {"text": "如果我理解有誤，能否請您為我澄清一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. My son's website, www.majesticdocuments.com, has 64 documents in it.
→ {"text": "我兒子的網站 www.majesticdocuments.com 上有 64 份文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. This is one of the 64.
→ {"text": "這是 64 份中的其中一份。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. Oh, I see.
→ {"text": "哦，我明白了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. And basically it is a replication of the manual that was photographed on a 35-millimeter film.
→ {"text": "基本上，這是從 35 毫米底片拍攝的手冊的複製品。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. So from those photographs, I was able to recreate something that would seem to be exactly what it would have been in 1954.
→ {"text": "所以從那些照片中，我能夠重建出看起來與 1954 年原件完全一致的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. I understand. When the war office back in 1950, whatever, when the war office training manual is entitled, "Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology Recovery and Disposal."
→ {"text": "我明白了。當 1950 年左右的戰爭部訓練手冊標題為《外星實體與科技回收處置》時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. Correct.
→ {"text": "正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. That's what it says.
→ {"text": "就是這樣寫的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. Right here.
→ {"text": "就在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. And then you've got, and we've seen, yeah, okay. In your opinion, as a, as clearly as a smart man, that's all I have to say.
→ {"text": "然後您有，我們也看到了，是的，好的。以您的意見，作為一位明顯聰明的人，我只想說這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. Does that mean the United States government at that time thought there was a high probability that there were, there could be extraterrestrial involvement in the UFO phenomena that had been clearly observed up to that point?
→ {"text": "這是否意味著美國政府當時認為，在截至那時已被明確觀察到的不明飛行物現象中，存在著外星參與的高度可能性？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. We've got evidence of 36 and earlier and others, and Roswell materials and so forth that were recovered and something unidentified, unexplained?
→ {"text": "我們有 1936 年及更早的證據，還有羅斯威爾事件的材料等等被回收的東西，一些未被識別、未被解釋的東西？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. Let me finish my question, if I could, Dr. Wood. Is that proof that the government at that time thought there was a high probability of extraterrestrial life involved, or is that an indication that the government thought it was an absolute reality that extraterrestrial was involved?
→ {"text": "請讓我把問題說完，伍德博士。這是否證明政府當時認為有外星生命參與的高度可能性，還是這表明政府認為外星參與是絕對的現實？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. Because wouldn't the government, with thinking that perhaps this is the best explanation, have to prepare documents to help researchers categorize not necessarily things they had found specifically, but things that had been cited that other people had found that had been reported to them?
→ {"text": "因為政府若認為這可能是最佳解釋，難道不需要準備文件來幫助研究人員分類，不一定是他們具體發現的東西，而是其他人發現並向他們報告的那些被引述的東西嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. I'm just trying to understand the context of Majestic 12.
→ {"text": "我只是想理解 Majestic 12 的背景脈絡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. And I'm asking Dr. Wood, I'm going to get to you in a moment, as how. I can see you're eager to say something. Go ahead.
→ {"text": "我在問伍德博士，我等一下會請教您。我看得出您很想說些什麼。請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. Well, I think the important point is that of the documents that I have, three of them basically cite crashes associated with the so-called Battle of LA in February 1942, where one was recovered in the San Bernardino Mountains and one was salvaged by the Navy at sea. In addition to that, there was a crash.
→ {"text": "嗯，我認為重點是，在我擁有的文件中，有三份基本上引述了與 1942 年 2 月所謂的洛杉磯之戰相關的墜毀事件，其中一架在聖貝納迪諾山脈被回收，另一架由海軍在海上打撈。除此之外，還有一次墜毀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. They were wondering about the probability, weren't they, of whether it was ET, not the reality, that they had already come to that conclusion?
→ {"text": "他們當時在思考可能性，不是嗎？思考是否為外星的可能性，而不是現實，也就是說他們還沒有得出那個結論？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. Well, my judgment is that they recovered these craft, and immediately they decided that it was very important, because we were essentially in the war with Nazi Germany and Japan, to keep this secret.
→ {"text": "嗯，我的判斷是他們回收了這些飛行器，並立即決定保密非常重要，因為我們當時實際上正在與納粹德國和日本交戰。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. And, of course, that would imply that they thought that maybe this was a Nazi maneuverable vehicle that may have been...
→ {"text": "當然，這意味著他們可能認為這是納粹的機動載具，可能是……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. The documents...
→ {"text": "這些文件……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. Clearly at that time, there was a lot of respect for German and Russian and engineering on things.
→ {"text": "顯然在那個時候，人們對德國和俄羅斯的工程技術非常尊重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. There's a...
→ {"text": "有一份……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. They couldn't, you know, they weren't exactly the same as what we had developed in the United States.
→ {"text": "他們無法，你知道的，它們與我們在美國開發的東西並不完全相同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. There's a double top-secret memo signed by FDR that alludes to non-terrestrial objects.
→ {"text": "有一份由羅斯福總統簽署的雙重最高機密備忘錄，暗指非地球的物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. And so, clearly, the language they were using in the early '40s, before 1945, was non-terrestrial.
→ {"text": "因此，顯然他們在 1940 年代早期、1945 年之前使用的措辭是「非地球的」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. And so, clearly, the government felt there's...
→ {"text": "因此，顯然政府認為有……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. It could even be that they felt it was the best explanation.
→ {"text": "甚至可能是他們認為這是最佳解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. But do they have... In these documents, is there something that absolutely is not just a report of, but an actual thing that they're saying is unquestionably of extraterrestrial origin?
→ {"text": "但他們是否有……在這些文件中，是否有某樣東西絕對不只是報告，而是他們所說的毫無疑問具有外星起源的實際物體？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. That's what I'm asking you.
→ {"text": "這就是我要問您的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. Well, they initiated a study called the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit that had a classification of top secret.
→ {"text": "嗯，他們啟動了一項名為跨行星現象研究小組的研究，其機密等級為最高機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. So, in my judgment, these early crashes were what triggered a process that is described in the 1954 document as to how we would be able to go and retrieve crashed or shot down flying saucers and be able to study them.
→ {"text": "因此，我認為這些早期墜毀事件觸發了 1954 年文件中描述的流程，說明我們如何能夠前往回收墜毀或被擊落的飛碟並加以研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. We have probably at least a hundred different crash retrievals over the world.
→ {"text": "全世界我們可能至少有一百次不同的墜毀回收案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. Sure. In other words, Dr. Wood, one of the possible explanations, and I'm not leading anybody anywhere here.
→ {"text": "當然。換句話說，伍德博士，可能的解釋之一，而且我並不是要引導任何人到任何方向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. I'm trying to understand it as best I can.
→ {"text": "我只是盡力去理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. And I don't care where this leads. I want to know the truth.
→ {"text": "我不在乎這會導向何方。我想知道真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. That's what getting rid of a truth embargo is all about.
→ {"text": "這就是消除真相封鎖的全部意義。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. But anyway, what I'm asking is, wouldn't it be prudent?
→ {"text": "但無論如何，我要問的是，這難道不是謹慎的做法嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. As what I think is apparent in some of the Canadian memos I'm going to ask Mr. Cameron about, that a government thinking that it might be the best explanation is going to set in procedures and even make descriptions, not necessarily because the government people that are writing these memos had witnessed the craft that had the legs of this, but they had received reports of crafts like this.
→ {"text": "正如我認為在一些我要向卡麥隆先生詢問的加拿大備忘錄中所顯現的，一個認為這可能是最佳解釋的政府會制定程序甚至做出描述，不一定是因為撰寫這些備忘錄的政府人員親眼目睹了具有這些特徵的飛行器，而是他們收到了關於類似飛行器的報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. And so they were preparing as people, they were much more eager, it seems to me in those days, to go out and try to find evidence of what they thought might be the best explanation.
→ {"text": "因此他們作為人員在做準備，在我看來，那個時代的他們更加積極地外出尋找他們認為可能是最佳解釋的證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. Now is that, I'm going to go to Mr. Cameron and say, is that consistent with this document that you look at?
→ {"text": "現在，我要問卡麥隆先生，這與您所查看的這份文件是否一致？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. And believe me, I want to commend everybody here that's been instrumental in getting some of these documents, because we wouldn't have had these documents without the four of you all sitting here in front of us today.
→ {"text": "相信我，我要讚揚在場所有在取得這些文件方面發揮關鍵作用的人，因為如果沒有今天坐在我們面前的你們四位，我們就不會有這些文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. And that's a great, great thing.
→ {"text": "這是一件非常、非常了不起的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. And in Canada, they're saying here in one of the memos you brought forth, that many sightings undoubtedly are due to unusual views of common objects or phenomena and are quite normal, but there are many sightings which cannot be explained so easily.
→ {"text": "在加拿大，他們在您提出的其中一份備忘錄中說，許多目擊事件無疑是由於對常見物體或現象的不尋常觀察角度造成的，相當正常，但也有許多目擊事件無法如此輕易解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. Now at the same time, they also say it appears then that we are faced with a substantial probability of the real existence of extraterrestrial vehicles.
→ {"text": "同時，他們也說，看來我們面臨著外星載具真實存在的相當大可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. Now, you know, as far as I'm concerned, if I were a member of Congress, which I was, if I were again, I would say to you that if I felt there was a substantial probability of the real existence of extraterrestrial vehicles based on reports that had come in, 86,000 in this country alone, 62,000 that had enough umph to be highlighted here this morning, witnesses, missile launch officers that saw things that caused the whole government to restructure some of their weapons systems, I would absolutely demand a hearing.
→ {"text": "現在，你知道，就我而言，如果我是國會議員，我曾經是，如果我再次成為議員，我會告訴你，如果基於收到的報告，我認為外星載具真實存在有相當大的可能性，光是這個國家就有 86,000 件，其中 62,000 件有足夠的份量在今天早上被強調，證人，飛彈發射官員看到的東西導致整個政府重組了部分武器系統，我絕對會要求舉行聽證會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. But that still does not prove that they thought there were extraterrestrials.
→ {"text": "但這仍然不能證明他們認為有外星人存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. And it does not prove from these documents that they were collecting materials that were in fact determined, at least by the government, as being extraterrestrial at the time.
→ {"text": "這些文件也不能證明他們當時收集的材料被政府確定為外星的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. A high probability, I absolutely agree, these documents show that.
→ {"text": "高度可能性，我完全同意，這些文件顯示了這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. And that's, hey, that's enough for me to want to investigate very seriously with very credible witnesses as you all are.
→ {"text": "而且，嘿，這對我來說已經足以讓我想與像你們這樣非常可信的證人一起進行非常認真的調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. And in the Congress of the United States, both the Senate and the House, I think it deserves that.
→ {"text": "在美國國會，無論是參議院還是眾議院，我認為這值得這樣做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. But I think, I just want to understand for sure if there's anything in the documents that you say is first source evidence of ET.
→ {"text": "但我認為，我只是想確定這些文件中是否有任何您所說的外星生命的第一手證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. I'm asking both of you that, and then I'll, anything in the document that is.
→ {"text": "我問你們兩位，然後我會，文件中是否有任何這樣的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. I'm talking about not just, you know, citing, not just a report.
→ {"text": "我說的不僅僅是，你知道的，引述，不僅僅是一份報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. No, it wouldn't be in the official material that I have presented to you.
→ {"text": "不，這不會出現在我向您提交的官方材料中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. In private writings, he does say that, yes, in his private writings.
→ {"text": "在私人著作中，他確實這麼說，是的，在他的私人著作中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. Who says that?
→ {"text": "誰這麼說？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. The guy who wrote the top secret memo, Wilbert B. Smith, who ran the Canadian government program from 1950 to 1954.
→ {"text": "撰寫最高機密備忘錄的那個人，威爾伯特·B·史密斯，他在 1950 年到 1954 年間主持加拿大政府計劃。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

308. But why in his public, are you saying that, oh, the reason he described it as just a high probability in public is because.
→ {"text": "但為什麼在他的公開場合，您是說，哦，他在公開場合將其描述為僅僅是高度可能性的原因是因為。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. Well, that's a preliminary report that was given to the Prime Minister of Canada in 1952.
→ {"text": "嗯，那是 1952 年提交給加拿大總理的初步報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. Sure, but they're going to keep it secret.
→ {"text": "當然，但他們會保密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. He thought.
→ {"text": "他認為。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. Pardon me?
→ {"text": "請再說一遍？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. Remember, he thought they were going to keep it secret.
→ {"text": "記住，他認為他們會保密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. It was only good detective work of you all where it's not been kept private.
→ {"text": "只是因為你們所有人的出色偵查工作，它才沒有被保密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. But I mean, why wouldn't he express his honest, to goodness, opinion publicly if he thought it was, hey, it was very clear.
→ {"text": "但我的意思是，如果他認為這很明確，為什麼他不在公開場合表達他真實、誠懇的意見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. It was very clear from this cover letter they were going to keep it under wraps.
→ {"text": "從這封附函可以很清楚地看出，他們打算保密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. Well, because the document is that top secret.
→ {"text": "嗯，因為那份文件是最高機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. It was all classified.
→ {"text": "全都是機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

319. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. And it was classified.
→ {"text": "而且是機密的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. This document was forced out by Stanton Friedman in 1978.
→ {"text": "這份文件是史丹頓·佛烈德曼在 1978 年迫使公開的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. No, I understand.
→ {"text": "不，我理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. It remained classified.
→ {"text": "它一直保持機密狀態。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. I've commended him for that.
→ {"text": "我已經為此讚揚過他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. And so there's a lot of stuff I'll talk about tomorrow behind the scenes of stuff that he was doing and the Canadians were doing that showed that they knew this was extraterrestrial.
→ {"text": "所以明天我會談論很多幕後的事情，關於他正在做的以及加拿大人正在做的事情，這顯示他們知道這是外星的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. But in the document, he does say the Americans say flying saucers exist.
→ {"text": "但在文件中，他確實說美國人說飛碟存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. It's simple.
→ {"text": "就這麼簡單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. Flying saucers exist.
→ {"text": "飛碟存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. He went down there.
→ {"text": "他去了那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. Tomorrow, I'll get into what he learned in the States and who was telling him what.
→ {"text": "明天，我會談到他在美國了解到的事情以及誰告訴他什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. Okay, but in the documents you have here in front of us, it doesn't.
→ {"text": "好的，但在您擺在我們面前的這些文件中，它沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. Or does it?
→ {"text": "還是有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. I'm not trying to get into any.
→ {"text": "我不是要陷入任何。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. Yeah, no.
→ {"text": "是的，不。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. It does say flying saucers exist.
→ {"text": "它確實說飛碟存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. That's what they were told.
→ {"text": "這就是他們被告知的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. And I see my time is up.
→ {"text": "我看到我的時間到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. Thank you very much for your answers.
→ {"text": "非常感謝您的回答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. I wish I could get out.
→ {"text": "我希望我能夠離開。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "語意略為模糊，可能指「離開」或「說出來」"}

340. I think you have something important to say and I hope we'll get it.
→ {"text": "我認為您有重要的事情要說，我希望我們能聽到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. And we'll come back to it.

345. Again, anyone that would like to answer any of these questions would be great.
→ {"text": "再次說明，任何人願意回答這些問題都很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. Have we, do we have other than what happened in Utah, do we have, or New Mexico, excuse me, do we have any other vehicles, UFOs, whatever you want to call them, do we have any of those that were crashed, shot down that we can examine?
→ {"text": "我們是否，除了在猶他州發生的事情，我們是否有，或者新墨西哥州，抱歉，我們是否有任何其他載具、不明飛行物，隨便你怎麼稱呼它們，我們是否有任何那些墜毀的、被擊落的可以檢查的東西？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. You mean publicly?
→ {"text": "您是指公開的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. Publicly.
→ {"text": "公開的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. It's all classified.
→ {"text": "全都是機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. That's the whole point of this thing, that the evidence that's available, the hard, you know, knock on the wheels, stuff is all classified.
→ {"text": "這就是整件事的重點，可用的證據，硬性的，你知道的，敲敲輪子的那種實物，全都是機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. That's the whole point of this thing, is that we don't have access.
→ {"text": "這整件事的重點就是我們無法取得。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

352. And if you look, there's plenty of classified documents, Bob showed a good one.
→ {"text": "如果你看看，有大量的機密文件，鮑勃展示了一份很好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. We don't get access to that.
→ {"text": "我們無法取得那些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. I don't have a need to know for any of that stuff.
→ {"text": "對於那些東西，我沒有知密權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. People say, what was the analysis of the material at Roswell?
→ {"text": "人們問，羅斯威爾事件材料的分析結果是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. I'm not on any list for sending classified information about Roswell or Aztec or any of the other crashes.
→ {"text": "我不在任何接收關於羅斯威爾事件或阿茲特克或任何其他墜毀事件機密資訊的名單上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. So when you say, do we have, if you mean the public, no, we do not.
→ {"text": "所以當您問我們是否有，如果您指的是公眾，不，我們沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. Are there bodies within governments, whether Canadian or American or Russian or English or whatever, that have that information, it's pretty clear that they do.
→ {"text": "政府內部是否有機構，無論是加拿大、美國、俄羅斯、英國或其他國家，擁有那些資訊，很明顯他們確實有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

359. Went somewhere.
→ {"text": "去了某個地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. We'll be talking about Roswell tomorrow.
→ {"text": "我們明天會談論羅斯威爾事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. And so we'll get into that.
→ {"text": "所以我們會談到那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. And one postscript, this is not about a probability, sir, this is how the government wanted the collection teams, which had names and numbers, to be how they would go out to retrieve craft, how they would go out and retrieve bodies dead and alive.
→ {"text": "還有一個附註，先生，這不是關於可能性，這是政府希望那些有名稱和編號的回收小組如何外出回收飛行器、如何外出回收死亡和活著的遺體的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. The whole procedure of how to deal with it was written and published in this 1954.
→ {"text": "如何處理它的整個程序都在這份 1954 年的文件中撰寫和發布了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. And how to cover it up.
→ {"text": "以及如何掩蓋它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. And how to cover it up.
→ {"text": "以及如何掩蓋它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. And if I could add, my son has written a book called Magic Eyes Only, which describes 74 different crash retrieval cases with an authenticity index for each one to give you the confidence that you should have.
→ {"text": "如果我可以補充，我兒子寫了一本名為《Magic Eyes Only》的書，描述了 74 個不同的墜毀回收案例，每個案例都有真實性指數，讓您能有應有的信心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. And some of them are very highly confident.
→ {"text": "其中一些的信心度非常高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. Some of them are questionable.
→ {"text": "有些則值得質疑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
