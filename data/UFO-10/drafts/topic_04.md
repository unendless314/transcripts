## Speaker Group 1

150. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no written testimony. If you have a written testimony there, it's actually for tomorrow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. I just wanted to be added to this panel today to talk about one particular document.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. I have a series of documents. It's got a memorandum on the top. I'll just be highlighting little bits and pieces of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. I do have a statement that I want to read. I have testified in front of this committee a number of times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. I would like to just say that it has been an honour to testify in front of this committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. We in the UFO community have complained for years that we have an important issue and that nobody has listened to us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. Unlike the uninformed newspaper articles that continue to be published this morning, this committee has done its research to prepare for our testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. You have listened carefully to our testimony, and most importantly, you have treated us with respect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. The latest Gallup poll places the approval rating at Congress at 15%.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. I am quite sure that in this room, your approval rating is much higher than that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. Lastly, I'd like to say that you have restored my faith in the fact that Congress, if they were to act like you on the panel have acted, would be an effective tool in a modern democracy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. Now, as to my testimony, I just want to go through these documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. The document I'm going to talk about is, if it's not the most important document in ufology, it's one of the most important documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. I want to just highlight some situations around that document.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. First, we should look at the Rockefeller slide.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. Can we put that up on the screen?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. Based on Senator Gravel's statement yesterday that we should be a little more aggressive in what we do, I've taken his advice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. These are the famous Rockefeller initiative documents, the 1,000 pages of documents that were released to me by the Clinton Library, and they have gone missing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. The Clinton say they don't have them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. National Archives says they don't have them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. I filed an appeal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. They've denied the appeal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. So what I've done, based on what Mr. Graval said yesterday, I intend to send them back to the Clinton Library, and it's going to be kind of embarrassing that they're going to get it from a foreign citizen, but we'll see what they do, whether they put this back in the presidential record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. These are 1,000 pages of documents that the Clinton say they no longer have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. Now, as to the documents, the document I'm going to talk quickly about is the Top Secret Memo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. It's a 1950 document from Canada, but I want to sort of go around the documents that talk about why this is so important.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. If you took a look at the top document called Memorandum there, you will see -- to give you some background -- in Canada, there were four different organizations that controlled UFO files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. There was the Department of Transport.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. There was the National Research Council.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. There was the RCMP, and there was the Department of Defense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. The Canadians, regardless of what anybody wants to say, are playing the same game as the Americans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. In the late 1960s, they shut down their UFO program, and they released all the siting files, which is what all the governments are doing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. They're just releasing their siting files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. But the actual discussion behind the siting files as to what does the president say, what does the head of the military think about this, what does the prime minister of Canada think about this, that is all the stuff behind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. That is the stuff that you will not see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. People will release the siting files, but they really don't mean anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. So in this memorandum, which is the document -- you've got it up there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. I'll read just the one paragraph.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. It says -- and what has happened here is all the documents in Canada, the siting file material, has been moved in the 1960s to the National Research Council, because nobody wants the documents, nobody knows what to do with them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. So the National Research Council gets stuck with these documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. And this is a memo from somebody in the Department of Defense talking about the fact that Project Magnet document is in these files that have come to you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. And he gives the warnings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. He says you should note here that the discussions behind Project Magnet are part of this file.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. And then he says at no time should this be made available to the public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. If you read the very last line talking about the stuff, the discussions behind the Project Magnet files, he says a copy of the Project Magnet file is attached to this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. The original is attached and should not be destroyed until such time as the UFO subject has cooled off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. So the intention was that the Project Magnet, the material behind Project Magnet, the discussions as to what was going on would be destroyed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. Thanks to Stanton Friedman, who's sitting beside me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. A lot of that material did come out in the late 1970s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. So I want to reference you to what they're trying to cover up, what they want to destroy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. If you look at Magnet report number one, which we found in the files of the guy who ran the Canadian government program, you will see Project Magnet report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. I'll refer to you to page two.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. At the top of page two it says, "This is an official report that sat on the Prime Minister's desk in Canada for three months, according to the wife of the guy who wrote it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. It appears then that we are faced with a substantial probability of the real existence of extraterrestrial vehicles, regardless of whether or not they fit into our scheme of things."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. That was the official conclusion by the Canadian government report in 1952, which went to the Prime Minister.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. Let's go to top secret document number one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. This is the famous top secret memo that Stanton Freeman helped force out in 1978.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. It was written in 1950, but it did not get declassified until 1978.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. As a top secret document, the Canadian government does not deny this document.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. It agrees that this is a legitimate document.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. It was stamped top secret.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. It was written by Wilbert B. Smith.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. The background to it was the Canadians in 1950 had decided they were going to go to the Americans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. They were going to find out what the Americans knew about the flying saucer program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. They went down and through the military attache at the Canadian embassy, and through the Canadian embassy they asked questions of the Americans, "Is this for real? What's going on?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. And here is the conclusion that went back to the Canadian government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. The subject is the most highly classified subject in the United States, rated higher than the hydrogen bomb.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. Flying saucers exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. Their modus operandi is unknown, but there's a small group headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush, who is the science advisor to Roosevelt, that he's in charge of the program.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. And the fourth thing was the entire matter is considered to be of tremendous significance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. And then the fifth point that he mentions, and this goes to Mr. Bartlett's question about how did they get here from 37 light years away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. He said, "I was further informed that mental phenomena may be associated with the flying saucers and that the Americans aren't doing very well because they've asked that if we're doing anything in Canada, they're willing to exchange credentials and talk to us about it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. That's the top secret memo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. Flying saucers exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. What's happened in the last 50 years has been a circus.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. Can we go to the next document, which would be embassy document number four?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. This is some of the documentation that was destroyed by the Canadian government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. It was recovered because Wilbur Smith had it in his personal files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. And I'll just read to you here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. This is the third secretary at the Canadian embassy writing to Wilbur Smith back in Canada.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. He said, "We are, of course, have our eyes and ears open and if anything significant should happen, you'll hear it through the right salient channel."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. These are the military liaison people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. "At the instructions of the ambassador in the embassy, apart from Wright and myself, nobody is to discuss the matter with anybody."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. So the Canadians have been told.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. And on the second page of that, which is embassy number four, basically it says, "The ambassador and I would be particularly interested in any indication that you may have heard of the possibility of an official statement."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. The Canadians in 1950 were sitting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. They had heard that the Americans had a crash-flying saucer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. They had been told that this was for real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. And they were sitting there waiting for the Americans to make a statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. So I'll just leave it at that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. And if there's any questions, we'll go from there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. Thanks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
