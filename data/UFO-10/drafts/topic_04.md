171. They've denied the appeal.
→ {"text": "他們駁回了申訴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

172. So what I've done, based on what Mr. Graval said yesterday, I intend to send them back to the Clinton Library, and it's going to be kind of embarrassing that they're going to get it from a foreign citizen, but we'll see what they do, whether they put this back in the presidential record.
→ {"text": "所以我決定，根據 Gravel 先生昨天所說的，我打算把這些文件寄回柯林頓總統圖書館，雖然他們從一位外國公民那裡收到這些文件會有點尷尬，但我們將會看到他們會怎麼做，是否會把這些文件重新放回總統檔案紀錄中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "現在，關於這些文件，我要簡要討論的是那份最高機密備忘錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "這是一份 1950 年來自加拿大的文件，但我想先從其他文件來說明為什麼這份文件如此重要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. If you took a look at the top document called Memorandum there, you will see -- to give you some background -- in Canada, there were four different organizations that controlled UFO files.
→ {"text": "如果你看一下頂部那份名為備忘錄的文件，你會看到——讓我先提供一些背景——在加拿大，有四個不同的機構管理不明飛行物檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

180. The Canadians, regardless of what anybody wants to say, are playing the same game as the Americans.
→ {"text": "加拿大人，無論任何人想說什麼，都在玩與美國人相同的遊戲。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

181. In the late 1960s, they shut down their UFO program, and they released all the siting files, which is what all the governments are doing.
→ {"text": "在 1960 年代後期，他們關閉了不明飛行物計畫，並釋出了所有的目擊檔案，這正是所有政府都在做的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. They're just releasing their siting files.
→ {"text": "他們只是釋出目擊檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. But the actual discussion behind the siting files as to what does the president say, what does the head of the military think about this, what does the prime minister of Canada think about this, that is all the stuff behind.
→ {"text": "但目擊檔案背後的實際討論——總統說了什麼、軍方首長對此有何看法、加拿大總理對此有何想法——這些才是幕後的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

184. That is the stuff that you will not see.
→ {"text": "這些才是你看不到的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

185. People will release the siting files, but they really don't mean anything.
→ {"text": "人們會釋出目擊檔案，但這些檔案實際上沒有什麼意義。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

186. So in this memorandum, which is the document -- you've got it up there.
→ {"text": "所以在這份備忘錄中，也就是這份文件——你們那裡有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

187. I'll read just the one paragraph.
→ {"text": "我只會讀其中一段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

188. It says -- and what has happened here is all the documents in Canada, the siting file material, has been moved in the 1960s to the National Research Council, because nobody wants the documents, nobody knows what to do with them.
→ {"text": "它說——這裡發生的情況是，加拿大所有的文件，也就是目擊檔案資料，在 1960 年代被移轉到加拿大國家研究委員會，因為沒有人想要這些文件，沒有人知道該怎麼處理它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. So the National Research Council gets stuck with these documents.
→ {"text": "所以加拿大國家研究委員會被迫接手這些文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. And this is a memo from somebody in the Department of Defense talking about the fact that Project Magnet document is in these files that have come to you.
→ {"text": "而這是來自國防部某人的備忘錄，談到磁鐵計劃文件就在這些送到你們那裡的檔案中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. And he gives the warnings.
→ {"text": "他提出了警告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. He says you should note here that the discussions behind Project Magnet are part of this file.
→ {"text": "他說你們應該注意，磁鐵計劃背後的討論是這份檔案的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. And then he says at no time should this be made available to the public.
→ {"text": "然後他說，在任何時候都不應該向公眾公開這些內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. If you read the very last line talking about the stuff, the discussions behind the Project Magnet files, he says a copy of the Project Magnet file is attached to this.
→ {"text": "如果你讀到最後一行，談到這些內容，也就是磁鐵計劃檔案背後的討論，他說磁鐵計劃檔案的副本附在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. The original is attached and should not be destroyed until such time as the UFO subject has cooled off.
→ {"text": "原件附在這裡，在不明飛行物議題冷卻下來之前，不應該銷毀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

196. So the intention was that the Project Magnet, the material behind Project Magnet, the discussions as to what was going on would be destroyed.
→ {"text": "所以他們的意圖是，磁鐵計劃、磁鐵計劃背後的資料、關於正在發生什麼事的討論，都應該被銷毀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. Thanks to Stanton Friedman, who's sitting beside me.
→ {"text": "多虧了坐在我旁邊的史丹頓·佛烈德曼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Whisper 轉錄錯誤已修正：原文 'Stanton Freeman' 應為 'Stanton Friedman'"}

198. A lot of that material did come out in the late 1970s.
→ {"text": "這些資料中的很大一部分確實在 1970 年代後期公開了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. So I want to reference you to what they're trying to cover up, what they want to destroy.
→ {"text": "所以我想讓你們看看他們試圖掩蓋什麼、想要銷毀什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. If you look at Magnet report number one, which we found in the files of the guy who ran the Canadian government program, you will see Project Magnet report.
→ {"text": "如果你看磁鐵報告第一號，我們是在負責加拿大政府計畫那個人的檔案中找到的，你會看到磁鐵計劃報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. I'll refer to you to page two.
→ {"text": "我要請你們參考第二頁。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. At the top of page two it says, "This is an official report that sat on the Prime Minister's desk in Canada for three months, according to the wife of the guy who wrote it.
→ {"text": "在第二頁的頂部，它說：「根據撰寫者妻子的說法，這份官方報告在加拿大總理的辦公桌上放了三個月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. It appears then that we are faced with a substantial probability of the real existence of extraterrestrial vehicles, regardless of whether or not they fit into our scheme of things."
→ {"text": "因此，我們似乎面對著外星載具真實存在的重大可能性，無論它們是否符合我們的既有認知體系。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. That was the official conclusion by the Canadian government report in 1952, which went to the Prime Minister.
