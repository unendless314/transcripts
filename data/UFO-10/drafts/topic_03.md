## Speaker Group 1

100. You have made your point very well and I would like to go on to the next witness. Our Canadian friends, Dr. Friedman, yours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. Mr. Friedman and I am a Canadian and an American. I am a bifurcated. It is a privilege to be here representing both countries if you will. I found the proceedings fascinating. I would like to throw in a comment that isn't in the written piece that I submitted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. Within two weeks of the start of World War II, a person was appointed to be the chief censor of the United States to make sure that material that might be of assistance to the enemy not be released.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. Two interesting aspects of that are that the word uranium was not to show up anywhere after a while and that the effects of the Japanese fugo balloons, balloons carrying incendiaries which were supposed to cause fires and all that sort of thing, nothing was to be said about their impact so that they wouldn't know whether or not they were being useful or not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. So censorship is a major part of military operations if you will.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. The second thing that I'd like to note is that we've talked about the press, we've talked about the government, the witnesses, what we haven't talked about, and the press of course, but what we haven't talked about is the scientific community and their failure to take this issue into consideration.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. I've given 700 lectures at colleges and technical groups and while I've been extremely well received, what I also find is that there are many, many professors who think there's nothing to this subject who are perfectly willing to say stupid things really about the impossibility of this, that, or the other thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. Four basic rules for debunkers which I have found. We need to be cognizant of this. First, don't bother me with the facts, my mind's made up. Second, what the public doesn't know, I'm not going to tell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. Third, if you can't attack the data, attack the people. And fourth, do your research by proclamation. Investigation is too much trouble and nobody will know the difference anyway.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. So that's the kind of climate we're in here. Okay, now to get to my prepared brief text.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. I must admit that I am a document hound and have visited 20 different archives, including many visits to the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Reagan Presidential Archives, the National Archives, the Library of Congress Manuscript Division.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. There have been special sites such as the Harvard Archives, papers of Donald Menzel, the Princeton Archives, papers of James Forrestal, MIT Archives, papers of Vannevar Bush, the American Philosophical Society Library, which has papers of Edward Condon, Donald Menzel, Philip Class, Boston University Archives, John Fuller, Ben Simon. There have been surprises and I've seen many phony documents, not at archives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. Especially ones supposedly dealing with the Majestic 12 Group that you've already heard about. And I note with interest that all the copies of my book Top Secret Magic are gone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. Did the government send somebody in to buy them all up so you wouldn't have access? That's a parenthetical comment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. I didn't bring that many books. If I'd known they were going to do that, I would have brought more. There have been surprises in my investigations, especially ones about documents supposedly dealing with the Majestic 12 Group.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. I am fortunate that I worked under security for 14 years. I can't hold a candle to Bob, he worked for 40 years, but I dealt often with classified documents and learned the rules of the game.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. I have found that there are many misconceptions about documents. These include a) documents are periodically reviewed for declassification and must be declassified after a certain number of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. That's simply not true. It happens sometimes, but it's not a rule. b) People working on classified projects such as Majestic 12 would of course talk to a spouse about what they were doing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. I had a clearance for 14 years, never talked to my wife about classified work. Dr. Vannevar Bush's secretary told me she worried about saying something classified in her sleep because her husband did not have a clearance. c) Having a certain level of clearance, such as top secret, gives one access to all top secret documents. This is false. One needs a need to know. I couldn't get access to nuclear submarine radiation shielding information, though I had the appropriate security clearance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. But I couldn't get a need to know from Admiral Rickover for my aircraft nuclear propulsion radiation shielding work. The clearance wasn't the problem, the need to know was the problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. And I must say, there are people in Washington who think because there are big shots in Washington, if something were going on about this, they would know about it, even though they don't know about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. There's the notion that higher security documents can be referenced in lower security ones. That's not true either. People goof on occasion, but also I've been challenged.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. After all, Stan, all documents have been scanned and are easily accessed from a home computer. What are you talking about going either and there to find truth?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. I wish that were so. There are an awful lot of documents that haven't been scanned and aren't available, especially at the archives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. It would make life a lot simpler. There are some special archives where you can get that done. In 1970, when I worked for Bob briefly at McDonnell Douglas, I had a search done of government contract reports using the key word, one key word, magneto aerodynamics. 900 documents were found, of which 90% were classified. I suspect some were for black projects and maybe even dealing with plasmas and UFOs, which is an area I'm particularly intrigued with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. I've spent a great deal of effort on the question of legitimacy of the Majestic 12 documents and reported my findings in my book, Top Secret Magic, in an update chapter in my book, Flying Saucers in Science, and my final report on Operation Majestic 12.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. I believe I have dealt with all the anti-arguments about the Eisenhower briefing document, the Truman-Forestall memo, the Cutler-Twining memo. All three stand up to the attacks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. For example, this includes proving that Dr. Donald Menzel, supposedly a skeptic, did loads of very classified work, though unknown to the outside world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. In the letter to John F. Kennedy, which I found at the Harvard Archives, there's Dr. Menzel telling John Kennedy that he had a longer continuous association with the National Security Agency and its Navy predecessor, more than 30 years as of 1960, than anybody else in the country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. When we are properly cleared to each other, I can tell you more. And yet, there is no indication in two issues of Sky and Telescope magazine dedicated to Dr. Menzel in which his post-World War II intense involvement with all kinds of classified activities was even mentioned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. One was on the time of his death. One was the 100th anniversary of his birth. But nobody knew about this stuff until I, to my shock, found this out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. I showed one of the arguments was made by Philip Class, who was an aviation week and space technology reporter right in this town, and the go-to man for somebody looking for a debunker.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. And he said everything was baloney. He claimed that the proof that those documents are fault was cleared.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. One of the documents used a pica typeface, and he had nine documents from the National Security Council that were an elite type. Therefore, the documents were fraudulent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. Now, he made it worth my while to prove him wrong. He offered me $100 each for every genuine NSC document meeting all kinds of specifications done in the same size and style type, up to a limit of 10, unfortunately, or I'd have been a wealthy man.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. He had never been to the Eisenhower Library. I spent a lot of time there. I was going soon. He gave me 60 days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. I went. I found 14. I copied them. I sent him a copy and an invoice for $1,000, the limit. He paid me, told everybody about challenging me, nobody about paying me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. He also got very upset when I showed a copy of his check in one of the books that I wrote.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. Was that one minute that I saw there? Ouch. Well, okay. His check is in one of my books. A copy of his check is in one of my books.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. I want to say that archivists can be helpful, that there have been a lot of phony arguments and a lot of people who don't do their homework.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. Every top secret document has to have a top secret control number. I was told that several times. It's a lie.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. I got two archivists saying, "We got loads of top secret documents without top secret control numbers."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. Incidentally, with regard to class, a lot of his papers are up in Philadelphia at the American Philosophical Society Library.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. There was no Friedman fight. We corresponded for 20 years. I don't think he wanted anybody to know that he paid me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. That's why I was so mad that I published a copy of his check.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. There are also times, just one last point, when a perfectly legitimate document might have a false claim in it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. For example, General Twining wrote a letter to a pretty good-sized group of people in which he expressed a desire, "Wouldn't it be great if we had pieces of a saucer?" People have interpreted this as saying there weren't any such pieces.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. A lot of the people that were getting this memo didn't have a need to know for this stuff, so he had a lie. That's the way it goes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. Thank you. It's a fascinating area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. Thank you very much. We'll go to our next witness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
