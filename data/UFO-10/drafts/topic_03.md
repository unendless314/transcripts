## Speaker Group 1

100. You have made your point very well and I would like to go on to the next witness. Our Canadian friends, Dr. Friedman, yours.
→ {"text": "您的觀點闡述得非常清楚，我想繼續下一位證人的證詞。我們的加拿大朋友，佛烈德曼博士，輪到您了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. Mr. Friedman and I am a Canadian and an American. I am a bifurcated. It is a privilege to be here representing both countries if you will. I found the proceedings fascinating. I would like to throw in a comment that isn't in the written piece that I submitted.
→ {"text": "我是佛烈德曼先生，我既是加拿大人也是美國人。我具有雙重身份。能在此代表兩國發言是我的榮幸。我發現這場聽證會相當引人入勝。我想補充一點我書面陳述中沒有提到的意見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

102. Within two weeks of the start of World War II, a person was appointed to be the chief censor of the United States to make sure that material that might be of assistance to the enemy not be released.
→ {"text": "二戰開始後兩週內，美國任命了一位首席審查官，以確保任何可能對敵方有利的資訊都不會被公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. Two interesting aspects of that are that the word uranium was not to show up anywhere after a while and that the effects of the Japanese fugo balloons, balloons carrying incendiaries which were supposed to cause fires and all that sort of thing, nothing was to be said about their impact so that they wouldn't know whether or not they were being useful or not.
→ {"text": "這方面有兩個有趣的案例：一是「鈾」這個詞在一段時間後不得出現在任何地方；二是關於日本風船炸彈的影響——這些攜帶燃燒彈的氣球本應引發火災等破壞——對其影響絕對不能有任何報導，以免讓敵方得知它們是否有效。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "fugo balloons 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「風船炸彈」"}

104. So censorship is a major part of military operations if you will.
→ {"text": "因此可以說，審查制度是軍事行動的重要組成部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. The second thing that I'd like to note is that we've talked about the press, we've talked about the government, the witnesses, what we haven't talked about, and the press of course, but what we haven't talked about is the scientific community and their failure to take this issue into consideration.
→ {"text": "我想指出的第二點是，我們已經談論了媒體、政府和證人，但我們尚未談論的——我們還沒有談論的是科學界，以及他們未能認真對待這個議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

106. I've given 700 lectures at colleges and technical groups and while I've been extremely well received, what I also find is that there are many, many professors who think there's nothing to this subject who are perfectly willing to say stupid things really about the impossibility of this, that, or the other thing.
→ {"text": "我在大學和技術團體做過 700 場演講，雖然反應非常好，但我也發現有許多教授認為這個主題毫無意義，並且樂於對這個或那個不可能性發表實在愚蠢的言論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

107. Four basic rules for debunkers which I have found. We need to be cognizant of this. First, don't bother me with the facts, my mind's made up. Second, what the public doesn't know, I'm not going to tell.
→ {"text": "我總結出懷疑論者的四條基本規則，我們需要認清這一點。第一，別拿事實煩我，我心意已決。第二，公眾不知道的事，我不會告訴他們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

108. Third, if you can't attack the data, attack the people. And fourth, do your research by proclamation. Investigation is too much trouble and nobody will know the difference anyway.
→ {"text": "第三，如果無法攻擊數據，就攻擊當事人。第四，靠宣告來做研究。調查太麻煩，反正沒人會知道有什麼差別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

109. So that's the kind of climate we're in here. Okay, now to get to my prepared brief text.
→ {"text": "這就是我們所處的氛圍。好了，現在讓我回到我準備好的簡短陳述。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. I must admit that I am a document hound and have visited 20 different archives, including many visits to the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Reagan Presidential Archives, the National Archives, the Library of Congress Manuscript Division.
→ {"text": "我必須承認我是個文件狂，曾造訪 20 個不同的檔案館，包括多次前往杜魯門、艾森豪、甘迺迪、雷根總統檔案館、美國國家檔案館、美國國會圖書館手稿部門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "總統檔案館名稱依 terminology.yaml 翻譯"}

111. There have been special sites such as the Harvard Archives, papers of Donald Menzel, the Princeton Archives, papers of James Forrestal, MIT Archives, papers of Vannevar Bush, the American Philosophical Society Library, which has papers of Edward Condon, Donald Menzel, Philip Class, Boston University Archives, John Fuller, Ben Simon. There have been surprises and I've seen many phony documents, not at archives.
→ {"text": "還有一些特殊場所，例如哈佛檔案館的唐納德·孟澤爾博士文件、普林斯頓檔案館的詹姆斯·福萊斯特文件、MIT 檔案館的萬尼瓦爾·布什博士文件、美國哲學學會圖書館收藏的愛德華·康登、唐納德·孟澤爾博士、菲利普·克拉斯的文件，以及波士頓大學檔案館的約翰·富勒、班·西蒙文件。我發現了一些驚人的內容，也見過許多偽造文件，不過不是在檔案館。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "人名依 terminology.yaml 翻譯"}

112. Especially ones supposedly dealing with the Majestic 12 Group that you've already heard about. And I note with interest that all the copies of my book Top Secret Magic are gone.
→ {"text": "特別是那些聲稱與你們已經聽說過的 Majestic 12 小組有關的文件。我很有興趣地注意到，我的書《最高機密 Magic》的所有副本都已經售罄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Majestic 12 Group 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「Majestic 12 小組」"}

113. Did the government send somebody in to buy them all up so you wouldn't have access? That's a parenthetical comment.
→ {"text": "是政府派人把它們全買走了，讓你們無法取得嗎？這只是題外話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. I didn't bring that many books. If I'd known they were going to do that, I would have brought more. There have been surprises in my investigations, especially ones about documents supposedly dealing with the Majestic 12 Group.
→ {"text": "我沒帶那麼多本書。如果我知道會這樣，我就會多帶一些。我的調查中有一些驚人發現，特別是關於那些聲稱與 Majestic 12 小組有關的文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

115. I am fortunate that I worked under security for 14 years. I can't hold a candle to Bob, he worked for 40 years, but I dealt often with classified documents and learned the rules of the game.
→ {"text": "我很幸運，曾在保密環境下工作 14 年。我比不上鮑勃，他工作了 40 年，但我經常處理機密文件，學會了這行的規則。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Classified 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「機密」"}

116. I have found that there are many misconceptions about documents. These include a) documents are periodically reviewed for declassification and must be declassified after a certain number of years.
→ {"text": "我發現人們對文件有許多誤解。這些誤解包括：（a）文件會定期審查以解密，且必須在一定年限後解密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

117. That's simply not true. It happens sometimes, but it's not a rule. b) People working on classified projects such as Majestic 12 would of course talk to a spouse about what they were doing.
→ {"text": "這根本不是事實。這種情況有時會發生，但不是規定。（b）從事機密計畫（例如 Majestic 12）的人當然會向配偶談論他們在做什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. I had a clearance for 14 years, never talked to my wife about classified work. Dr. Vannevar Bush's secretary told me she worried about saying something classified in her sleep because her husband did not have a clearance. c) Having a certain level of clearance, such as top secret, gives one access to all top secret documents. This is false. One needs a need to know. I couldn't get access to nuclear submarine radiation shielding information, though I had the appropriate security clearance.
→ {"text": "我擁有許可 14 年，從未向妻子談論機密工作。萬尼瓦爾·布什博士的秘書告訴我，她擔心自己會在睡夢中說出機密內容，因為她丈夫沒有安全許可。（c）擁有某個等級的安全許可，例如最高機密，就能接觸所有最高機密文件。這是錯的。你需要有知密權。儘管我擁有適當的安全許可，但我無法取得核子潛艇輻射屏蔽的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Top Secret 譯為「最高機密」，need to know 譯為「知密權」（核心術語）"}

119. But I couldn't get a need to know from Admiral Rickover for my aircraft nuclear propulsion radiation shielding work. The clearance wasn't the problem, the need to know was the problem.
→ {"text": "但我無法從里科弗上將那裡取得我的飛機核動力輻射屏蔽工作的知密權。安全許可不是問題，知密權才是問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "再次強調 need to know = 知密權的核心概念"}

120. And I must say, there are people in Washington who think because there are big shots in Washington, if something were going on about this, they would know about it, even though they don't know about it.
→ {"text": "我必須說，華盛頓有些人認為，既然他們是華盛頓的大人物，如果這方面有什麼進展，他們一定會知道，儘管他們實際上並不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. There's the notion that higher security documents can be referenced in lower security ones. That's not true either. People goof on occasion, but also I've been challenged.
→ {"text": "還有一種觀念認為，較高機密等級的文件可以在較低機密等級的文件中引用。這也不是真的。人們偶爾會犯錯，但我也曾因此受到質疑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. After all, Stan, all documents have been scanned and are easily accessed from a home computer. What are you talking about going either and there to find truth?
→ {"text": "畢竟，史丹，所有文件都已經掃描了，可以輕鬆從家用電腦存取。你為什麼還要到處跑去尋找真相？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Stan 是 Stanton 的暱稱"}

123. I wish that were so. There are an awful lot of documents that haven't been scanned and aren't available, especially at the archives.
→ {"text": "我也希望是這樣。有太多文件尚未掃描且無法取得，特別是在檔案館裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. It would make life a lot simpler. There are some special archives where you can get that done. In 1970, when I worked for Bob briefly at McDonnell Douglas, I had a search done of government contract reports using the key word, one key word, magneto aerodynamics. 900 documents were found, of which 90% were classified. I suspect some were for black projects and maybe even dealing with plasmas and UFOs, which is an area I'm particularly intrigued with.
→ {"text": "那會讓生活簡單得多。有些特殊檔案館可以做到這一點。1970 年，我在麥克唐納-道格拉斯公司短暫為鮑勃工作時，我用一個關鍵詞「磁氣動力學」搜尋政府合約報告。找到了 900 份文件，其中 90% 是機密的。我懷疑其中一些是黑計畫，甚至可能涉及電漿和不明飛行物，這是我特別感興趣的領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "McDonnell Douglas 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「麥克唐納-道格拉斯公司」"}

125. I've spent a great deal of effort on the question of legitimacy of the Majestic 12 documents and reported my findings in my book, Top Secret Magic, in an update chapter in my book, Flying Saucers in Science, and my final report on Operation Majestic 12.
→ {"text": "我在 Majestic 12 文件的真實性問題上投入了大量精力，並在我的書《最高機密 Magic》、我的書《科學中的飛碟》的更新章節，以及我關於 Majestic 12 行動的最終報告中報告了我的發現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Flying Saucers 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「飛碟」"}

126. I believe I have dealt with all the anti-arguments about the Eisenhower briefing document, the Truman-Forestall memo, the Cutler-Twining memo. All three stand up to the attacks.
→ {"text": "我相信我已經處理了所有針對艾森豪簡報文件、杜魯門-福萊斯特備忘錄、卡特勒-特溫寧備忘錄的反駁論點。這三份文件都經得起攻擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Cutler-Twining memo 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「卡特勒-特溫寧備忘錄」"}

127. For example, this includes proving that Dr. Donald Menzel, supposedly a skeptic, did loads of very classified work, though unknown to the outside world.
→ {"text": "例如，這包括證明唐納德·孟澤爾博士——據稱是懷疑論者——從事了大量高度機密的工作，儘管外界並不知情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Donald Menzel 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「唐納德·孟澤爾博士」"}

128. In the letter to John F. Kennedy, which I found at the Harvard Archives, there's Dr. Menzel telling John Kennedy that he had a longer continuous association with the National Security Agency and its Navy predecessor, more than 30 years as of 1960, than anybody else in the country.
→ {"text": "在我於哈佛檔案館發現的一封致約翰·F·甘迺迪的信中，孟澤爾博士告訴甘迺迪，截至 1960 年，他與國家安全局及其前身海軍單位的持續合作超過 30 年，比國內任何人都長。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. When we are properly cleared to each other, I can tell you more. And yet, there is no indication in two issues of Sky and Telescope magazine dedicated to Dr. Menzel in which his post-World War II intense involvement with all kinds of classified activities was even mentioned.
→ {"text": "當我們彼此獲得適當的許可時，我可以告訴你更多。然而，在兩期獻給孟澤爾博士的《天空與望遠鏡》雜誌中，完全沒有提到他在二戰後深度參與各種機密活動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. One was on the time of his death. One was the 100th anniversary of his birth. But nobody knew about this stuff until I, to my shock, found this out.
→ {"text": "一期是在他去世時，一期是在他誕辰 100 週年。但直到我震驚地發現這些內容之前，沒有人知道這些事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. I showed one of the arguments was made by Philip Class, who was an aviation week and space technology reporter right in this town, and the go-to man for somebody looking for a debunker.
→ {"text": "我證明了其中一個論點是由菲利普·克拉斯提出的，他是《航空週刊與太空技術》雜誌就在這個城市的記者，也是想找懷疑論者的人的首選。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Philip Class 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「菲利普·克拉斯」"}

132. And he said everything was baloney. He claimed that the proof that those documents are fault was cleared.
→ {"text": "他說一切都是胡說八道。他聲稱那些文件是偽造的證據是明確的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. One of the documents used a pica typeface, and he had nine documents from the National Security Council that were an elite type. Therefore, the documents were fraudulent.
→ {"text": "其中一份文件使用了 pica 字型，而他有九份來自國家安全委員會的文件使用的是 elite 字型。因此，那些文件是偽造的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "pica 和 elite 是字型名稱，保留原文"}

134. Now, he made it worth my while to prove him wrong. He offered me $100 each for every genuine NSC document meeting all kinds of specifications done in the same size and style type, up to a limit of 10, unfortunately, or I'd have been a wealthy man.
→ {"text": "他讓我證明他錯了變得很值得。他提議，每找到一份符合各種規格、使用相同尺寸和樣式字型的真實國家安全委員會文件，就給我 100 美元，不幸的是上限是 10 份，否則我就發財了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

135. He had never been to the Eisenhower Library. I spent a lot of time there. I was going soon. He gave me 60 days.
→ {"text": "他從未去過艾森豪圖書館。我在那裡花了很多時間。我很快就要去了。他給了我 60 天。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. I went. I found 14. I copied them. I sent him a copy and an invoice for $1,000, the limit. He paid me, told everybody about challenging me, nobody about paying me.
→ {"text": "我去了。我找到了 14 份。我複印了它們。我寄給他副本和 1,000 美元的發票，也就是上限金額。他付了錢，到處告訴別人他挑戰了我，卻沒告訴任何人他付了我錢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. He also got very upset when I showed a copy of his check in one of the books that I wrote.
→ {"text": "當我在我寫的一本書中展示他的支票副本時，他非常不高興。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. Was that one minute that I saw there? Ouch. Well, okay. His check is in one of my books. A copy of his check is in one of my books.
→ {"text": "我看到的是一分鐘嗎？哎呀。好吧。他的支票在我的一本書裡。他的支票副本在我的一本書裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "此處 Friedman 注意到時間限制"}

139. I want to say that archivists can be helpful, that there have been a lot of phony arguments and a lot of people who don't do their homework.
→ {"text": "我想說，檔案管理員可以提供幫助，但有很多虛假論點，也有很多人沒有做好功課。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. Every top secret document has to have a top secret control number. I was told that several times. It's a lie.
→ {"text": "每份最高機密文件都必須有最高機密控制編號。我被告知過好幾次。這是謊言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Top Secret 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「最高機密」"}

141. I got two archivists saying, "We got loads of top secret documents without top secret control numbers."
→ {"text": "我得到兩位檔案管理員的說法：「我們有大量沒有最高機密控制編號的最高機密文件。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. Incidentally, with regard to class, a lot of his papers are up in Philadelphia at the American Philosophical Society Library.
→ {"text": "順帶一提，關於克拉斯，他的許多文件在費城的美國哲學學會圖書館。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. There was no Friedman fight. We corresponded for 20 years. I don't think he wanted anybody to know that he paid me.
→ {"text": "沒有所謂的佛烈德曼之爭。我們通信了 20 年。我認為他不想讓任何人知道他付了我錢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. That's why I was so mad that I published a copy of his check.
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼我如此生氣，以至於公布了他的支票副本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. There are also times, just one last point, when a perfectly legitimate document might have a false claim in it.
→ {"text": "還有些時候，最後一點，一份完全合法的文件中可能包含虛假聲明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. For example, General Twining wrote a letter to a pretty good-sized group of people in which he expressed a desire, "Wouldn't it be great if we had pieces of a saucer?" People have interpreted this as saying there weren't any such pieces.
→ {"text": "例如，特溫寧將軍寫了一封信給相當多的人，他在信中表達了一個願望：「如果我們有飛碟碎片，那該多好？」人們將此解讀為當時並沒有這樣的碎片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. A lot of the people that were getting this memo didn't have a need to know for this stuff, so he had a lie. That's the way it goes.
→ {"text": "很多收到這份備忘錄的人並沒有知密權，所以他撒了謊。事情就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "need to know 依 terminology.yaml 譯為「知密權」，這是整個證詞的核心論點"}

148. Thank you. It's a fascinating area.
→ {"text": "謝謝。這是個引人入勝的領域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. Thank you very much. We'll go to our next witness.
→ {"text": "非常感謝您。我們將繼續下一位證人的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
