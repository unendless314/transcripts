→ {"text": "今天早上各位之前已經作過證。這是例行程序。好的，請全體起立，我們將進行宣誓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. An affirmation. Ms. Howe is on the morning panel, so we'll excuse her.
→ {"text": "宣誓程序。Howe 女士屬於上午的小組，所以我們讓她退席。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. If you would repeat after me, I'd hereby affirm that I will tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, to this committee today.
→ {"text": "請跟著我複誦：我在此宣誓，今天將向本委員會陳述真相，完整的真相，只有真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. Thank you very much. Thank you.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

5. We'll proceed with, and for the members, since we were really cutting short on a couple of the members, we're going to reverse the order.
→ {"text": "我們將繼續進行，由於我們確實縮短了幾位委員的時間，我們將調整順序。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. We'll start with the congressman and then go to Darlene.
→ {"text": "我們將從眾議員開始，然後是 Darlene。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. Well, no, I don't want to take any credit for that. That was Congresswoman Woolsey that suggested that to me, and I'm very suggestible.
→ {"text": "嗯，不，我不想為此居功。那是 Woolsey 眾議員向我提議的，而我很容易接受建議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. Dr. Wood, please.
→ {"text": "伍德博士，請。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. Yeah, I'm Dr. Bob Wood. Appreciate being on this committee as a witness.
→ {"text": "是的，我是鮑勃·伍德博士。很榮幸能作為證人出席本委員會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. I got a PhD in physics so I could become a better engineer, and it turned out pretty well for me.
→ {"text": "我取得了物理學博士學位，以便成為更優秀的工程師，結果對我來說非常成功。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. I wound up working continuously for 43 years for one company, the Douglas Aircraft Company, becoming McDonnell Douglas, now a part of Boeing.
→ {"text": "我最終在一家公司連續工作了 43 年，道格拉斯飛機公司，後來成為麥克唐納-道格拉斯公司，現在是波音公司的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. My normal career there had me involved in the thermodynamics of keeping missiles cool, managing and selling the independent research and development projects of a couple of dozen scientists and engineers, designing radars to discriminate between Soviet ballistic missiles and their decoys, applying advanced technology to make the space station cheaper, better, and sooner, and finally helping to sell the Delta launch vehicle as the workhorse for NASA orbital payloads.
→ {"text": "我在那裡的正常職業生涯包括：參與導彈冷卻的熱力學研究、管理和推銷數十位科學家與工程師的獨立研發專案、設計用於辨識蘇聯彈道導彈與誘餌的雷達、應用先進技術使太空站更經濟、更優良、更快速，最後則是協助推銷 Delta 運載火箭作為 NASA 軌道酬載的主力工具。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. In addition, I ran one project in the late '60s to find out how UFOs work. We didn't find out.
→ {"text": "此外，我在 60 年代末期主持了一項專案，試圖了解不明飛行物的運作原理。我們沒有找到答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. And had one project on remote viewing, both of them proprietary.
→ {"text": "還有一項遙視專案，兩者都是專有項目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. My involvement with question documents came shortly after I had retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1993.
→ {"text": "我參與可疑文件研究是在 1993 年從麥克唐納-道格拉斯公司退休後不久。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. It was about the end of 1994 when my former colleague, Stan Friedman, from our old UFO research project, called me up and said that he had received a fax copy of an alleged war office training manual entitled "Extraterrestrial Entities in Technology, Recovery and Disposal." This is what it looks like.
→ {"text": "大約在 1994 年底，我過去在 UFO 研究專案中的同事史丹頓·佛烈德曼打電話給我，說他收到了一份傳真副本，是一本據稱的戰爭部訓練手冊，標題為《外星實體、科技回收與處置》。這就是它的樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. Was I interested in trying to dig deeper? The answer was yes, and I called the possessor of the 35 millimeter film from which this copy had been made, Don Berliner.
→ {"text": "我是否有興趣深入研究？答案是肯定的，於是我聯繫了持有這份副本來源的 35 毫米底片的人，唐·伯林納。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. Don was also interested in determining whether they might be genuine or fake, and he and I took the negatives to his local photo shop where we both monitored the process of reproduction and printing.
→ {"text": "唐也有興趣確定這些文件是真是假，他和我將底片帶到他當地的照相館，我們共同監督了複製和沖印過程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. Don was further helpful in lending me the box in which the film was mailed.
→ {"text": "唐還很樂意地把裝底片的郵寄盒借給我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. It had been mailed from a drug store in La Crosse, Wisconsin on March 7th, 1994.
→ {"text": "它是於 1994 年 3 月 7 日從威斯康辛州拉克羅斯的一家藥店寄出的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. And actually, you should have an attachment that permits you to see these images that are showing.
→ {"text": "事實上，各位應該有附件，可以看到這些正在展示的圖像。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. The manual itself consists of 28 numbered pages plus the cover and one document page control little i.
→ {"text": "這本手冊本身包含 28 頁編號頁面，加上封面和一頁文件頁面控制小 i。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "page control little i 可能指頁面控制編號 i，但不確定確切含義"}

23. There were six chapters and four appendices listed, but only the first appendix was shown.
→ {"text": "列出了六個章節和四個附錄，但只顯示了第一個附錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. The manual was a simple summary of the project and a detailed set of instructions of how to handle the recovery and removal of extraterrestrial craft and living organisms or EBE's extraterrestrial biological entities.
→ {"text": "這本手冊是該專案的簡要摘要，以及一套詳細的指示，說明如何處理外星飛行器和活體生物的回收與移除，也就是 EBE（外星生物實體）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. Where to ship the parts, how to do all this, and how to deceive the public with security measures.
→ {"text": "包括零件的運送地點、如何執行這一切，以及如何透過安全措施欺瞞公眾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. It was stamped with a security caveat of top secret magic eyes only on every page.
→ {"text": "每一頁都蓋有「最高機密 Magic Eyes Only」的安全警語戳記。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. Of particular interest is a table that specifies where to send the parts or bodies, noting Area 51 S4 and Blue Lab WP-61, both of which have been claimed by others to involve government UFO storage facilities.
→ {"text": "特別引人注意的是一張表格，詳細說明了零件或遺體的運送地點，包括 51 區 S4 設施和 Blue Lab WP-61，這兩處都被其他人聲稱涉及政府的 UFO 儲存設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. Also, the authentication interest is page I, documenting removal and replacement pages and the initials of the Magic 12 operations officer involved.
→ {"text": "此外，在驗證方面值得關注的是第 I 頁，記錄了頁面的移除和替換，以及相關 Magic 12 行動官員的姓名縮寫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. The two sets of initials are EWL and JRT. Neither person has been identified.
→ {"text": "這兩組縮寫是 EWL 和 JRT。兩人的身分都未能確認。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. After I had a high quality copy available, I was able to make an appointment with a public relations person from the government printing office right here in Washington.
→ {"text": "在我取得高品質副本後，我得以與華盛頓這裡的政府印刷局公關人員約見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. A long-time employee of the public printer, Mr. McCarter, was knowledgeable and helpful.
→ {"text": "政府印刷局的資深員工 McCarter 先生知識淵博且樂於協助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. He read the entire document while I waited, stopped several times to look more carefully, and then said something like, "Well, based on the content of this manual, I would say it was probably a fake, but there's something remarkable that makes me think twice about it.
→ {"text": "他在我等待時閱讀了整份文件，中途數次停下來更仔細地查看，然後說了類似這樣的話：「嗯，根據這本手冊的內容，我會說它可能是偽造的，但有些不尋常之處讓我重新思考。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. If you look closely, you'll see that some of the Z's are slightly raised."
→ {"text": "如果你仔細看，會發現有些 Z 字母略微凸起。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. This was happening with the type font in the 1950s time because the less used letters, especially the Z, would get some debris on the bottom of the lead, and when they dropped down, they sometimes would not fully seat.
→ {"text": "這種情況發生在 1950 年代的鉛字字型上，因為較少使用的字母，特別是 Z，會在鉛字底部積聚一些碎屑，當它們落下時，有時無法完全就位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. This is so unusual that I would say there is no doubt at all that they were printed on one of the presses in use at that time.
→ {"text": "這是如此不尋常，我可以毫無疑問地說，它們確實是在當時使用的某台印刷機上印製的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. We had one in this building and one in the basement of the Pentagon, and they were set up to handle top-secret jobs with all the security controls in place.
→ {"text": "我們在這棟建築裡有一台，五角大樓地下室還有一台，它們都配備了所有安全控制措施，專門處理最高機密的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. Because of the subtleties of the shape of the F and G letters, we identified the type font exactly, monotype modern, a popular one in heavy use at the time.
→ {"text": "由於 F 和 G 字母形狀的細微差異，我們精確地辨識出字型，正是 Monotype Modern 字型，這是當時廣泛使用的熱門字型。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. Our conclusion, this document was authentically printed by the government for some reason in 1954.
→ {"text": "我們的結論是，這份文件確實是由政府於 1954 年基於某種原因真實印製的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. The success of this evaluation caused Stan Friedman to call me again and say that he had someone writing to him that he had received many leaked documents from various sources, and that he lived in Big Bear Lake, a lot closer to me than he and Eastern Canada did. Therefore, with proper introduction, my wife and I visited Tim Cooper at his home there.
→ {"text": "這次評估的成功促使史丹頓·佛烈德曼再次打電話給我，說有人寫信給他，表示收到了來自各種來源的許多洩漏文件，而且他住在大熊湖，離我比他和加拿大東部近得多。因此，在適當介紹後，我和妻子前往 Tim Cooper 在那裡的住處拜訪他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. He said he was willing to share these documents because he wanted to determine their authenticity.
→ {"text": "他說願意分享這些文件，因為他想確定它們的真實性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. He had become interested in the topic because his father had told him a story about his own involvement in covertly printing a UFO retrieval report and had told Len Stringfield about this experience.
→ {"text": "他之所以對這個主題感興趣，是因為他父親曾告訴他一個故事，關於他自己參與秘密印製 UFO 回收報告的經歷，並曾向倫納德·H·斯特林菲爾德講述這段經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. Tim Cooper shared copies of several of his documents from several different sources that were included in October 1998 presentation to UFO Symposium jointly with my son and colleague Ryan.
→ {"text": "Tim Cooper 分享了他從幾個不同來源取得的文件副本，這些文件被納入 1998 年 10 月我和兒子兼同事 Ryan 共同在 UFO 研討會上的報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. This was the first time that significant authentication reports had been presented to the UFO community, and the word spread.
→ {"text": "這是第一次向 UFO 社群提出重要的驗證報告，消息傳了開來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. Actually, Linda was there at that meeting. The word spread resulting in a sponsor asking to further authenticate these documents and publish them widely.
→ {"text": "實際上，Linda 當時也在那場會議上。消息傳開後，有贊助者要求進一步驗證這些文件並廣泛發表。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. The sponsor also wanted Ryan and me to make a television documentary on their authenticity, and it was produced and shown on a sci-fi channel as "The Secret."
→ {"text": "贊助者還希望 Ryan 和我製作一部關於這些文件真實性的電視紀錄片，該片製作完成後在科幻頻道播出，名為《秘密》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. We decided that there was interest by other researchers, so Ryan created the website www.majesticdocuments.com for easy access to all the documents we possessed.
→ {"text": "我們認為其他研究者也會有興趣，因此 Ryan 建立了網站 www.majesticdocuments.com，方便存取我們擁有的所有文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. There are 10 sources for 103 documents, 3,800 pages. The website shows 64 of these documents, including 27 of them before 1948.
→ {"text": "共有 10 個來源提供的 103 份文件，共 3，800 頁。網站展示了其中 64 份文件，包括 27 份 1948 年之前的文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. Many of the documents we have received from multiple different sources to Tim Cooper, we have established beyond any doubt in our minds that he was not the author of any of these documents in several ways.
→ {"text": "我們從多個不同來源收到許多文件，而非僅來自 Tim Cooper，我們已經透過多種方式毫無疑問地確立，他並非這些文件中任何一份的作者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. We have original envelopes used to mail the documents. More importantly, we have used some forensic linguistics, including spelling errors, word and sentence length and syntax to show that Cooper's writing, of which we have a huge sample about the history of White Sands Missile Range, is inconsistent with any of the question documents.
→ {"text": "我們保留了用於郵寄文件的原始信封。更重要的是，我們使用了一些鑑識語言學方法，包括拼寫錯誤、詞句長度和句法，證明 Cooper 的寫作風格（我們有他關於白沙導彈靶場歷史的大量樣本）與任何可疑文件都不一致。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. It is clear that if there were secret projects studying UFOs, there would be written records. In the days of carbon copies, leaks would be expected to happen, so plans would be made to deal with them.
→ {"text": "很明顯，如果存在研究 UFO 的秘密專案，就會有書面記錄。在複寫紙時代，洩漏是可預期的，因此會制定應對計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. Such plans would involve controlling the media as much as possible, while denigrating and discouraging reality reporting, maximizing the idea that it's easy to fake anything these days with computers. This is not true when you have original paper and ink, and recognizing that many of the documents were leaked well before 2000.
→ {"text": "這類計畫會盡可能控制媒體，同時詆毀和阻撓真實報導，極力強調現今用電腦很容易偽造任何東西。但當你擁有原始紙張和墨水時，這種說法就站不住腳，而且要認識到許多文件早在 2000 年之前就已洩漏。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. Authentication of documents is a very orderly process. First, you establish provenance, if possible, usually unlikely for illegally leaked documents. There are two kinds of tests that can be performed, physical and intellectual.
→ {"text": "文件驗證是一個非常有條理的過程。首先，如果可能的話，要確立出處，但對於非法洩漏的文件通常不太可能。可以進行兩種測試：物理測試和知識測試。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. The physical ones involve dating ink, watermark or paper, identifying the typewriter make and model, matching the type font and press, and comparing signatures, other notations and handwriting. The intellectual tests look for anachronisms, comparing the language use, and comparing with known authentic documents.
→ {"text": "物理測試包括鑑定墨水、水印或紙張的年代，辨識打字機的品牌和型號，比對字型和印刷機，以及比較簽名、其他標記和筆跡。知識測試則尋找時代錯誤，比較語言使用，並與已知的真實文件進行比對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. More recently, the use of computerized forensic linguistics techniques permit one to make an estimate that a specific person was or was not the author of a question document.
→ {"text": "近年來，使用電腦化的鑑識語言學技術，可以估計特定人物是否為可疑文件的作者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. Signatures can be nearly identical if created with a Autopen device that permitted Truman to sign five letters at once.
→ {"text": "如果使用自動簽名機（Autopen）製作，簽名可以幾乎完全相同，這種裝置允許杜魯門總統一次簽署五封信件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "根據 topics.json 的 potential_errors，原文的 polygraph device 應為 Autopen device"}

56. The identification of one aspect of a question document as being anomalous often results in a skeptic accepting none of the rest of the document, even though it might be filled with accurate information.
→ {"text": "一旦可疑文件的某個方面被認定為異常，懷疑論者往往會拒絕接受文件的其餘部分，即使它可能充滿準確的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. It seems to be accepted in the intelligence community that fake documents usually, if not often, contain much valid information to help get it accepted as genuine throughout. Each part of a question document should be evaluated for its specific information and appearance and background.
→ {"text": "情報界似乎認可，偽造文件通常（如果不是經常的話）會包含大量有效資訊，以幫助其被全面接受為真實文件。可疑文件的每個部分都應該根據其具體資訊、外觀和背景進行評估。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. In the last decade, I have presented lectures in coordination with my son, Ryan, author of Magic Eyes Only, identifying 74 crash recoveries. My lectures are on the authenticity of the documents and the influence of the alien presence on our society.
→ {"text": "在過去十年中，我與兒子 Ryan（《Magic Eyes Only》的作者）共同進行了多場講座，指出 74 起墜毀回收案例。我的講座主題是文件的真實性以及外星存在對我們社會的影響。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

59. For me, the leaked documents, the synthesis with the literature and papers of the ufology community have provided extra insight into how we got to where we are.
→ {"text": "對我來說，洩漏的文件以及與 UFO 學界的文獻和論文的綜合研究，提供了額外的洞察，讓我們了解我們如何走到今天這一步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. The conclusion I've come to is incredibly wild, that those in charge have been successful in keeping secret the greatest story of mankind while covertly spending staggering sums to create hidden underground resources and reverse engineer the technology.
→ {"text": "我得出的結論極為驚人：掌權者成功地保守了人類歷史上最偉大的秘密，同時秘密地花費驚人的金額建造隱藏的地下資源並逆向工程這些技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. Until we can quantify the alien threat, how can we know whether these actions are good or bad? Let us hope, maybe with the help of one race of good aliens, that God will maybe do the right thing to happen.
→ {"text": "在我們能夠量化外星威脅之前，我們如何知道這些行動是好是壞？讓我們希望，也許在某個善良外星種族的幫助下，上帝也許會讓正確的事情發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. Here in the Beltway, I'm told that everyone has an agenda, very few want the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help be God. I think the American people deserve most of it, we paid for it.
→ {"text": "我聽說在華盛頓特區這裡，每個人都有自己的議程，很少有人想要真相，完整的真相，只有真相，上帝作證。我認為美國人民應該得知大部分真相，畢竟是我們付的錢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. Thank you very much, Dr. Wood.
→ {"text": "非常感謝您，伍德博士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "根據 topics.json 的 potential_errors，原文的 Dr. Wilkins 應為 Dr. Wood"}
