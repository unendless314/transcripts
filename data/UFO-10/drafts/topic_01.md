## Speaker Group 1

1. This morning you've testified before. It's a daily. Okay, all of you stand, and we'll have an affirmation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

2. An affirmation. Ms. Howe is on the morning panel, so we'll excuse her.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

3. If you would repeat after me, I'd hereby affirm that I will tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, to this committee today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

4. Thank you very much. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

5. We'll proceed with, and for the members, since we were really cutting short on a couple of the members, we're going to reverse the order.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

6. We'll start with the congressman and then go to Darlene.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

7. Well, no, I don't want to take any credit for that. That was Congresswoman Woolsey that suggested that to me, and I'm very suggestible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

8. Dr. Wood, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. Yeah, I'm Dr. Bob Wood. Appreciate being on this committee as a witness.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. I got a PhD in physics so I could become a better engineer, and it turned out pretty well for me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. I wound up working continuously for 43 years for one company, the Douglas Aircraft Company, becoming McDonnell Douglas, now a part of Boeing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. My normal career there had me involved in the thermodynamics of keeping missiles cool, managing and selling the independent research and development projects of a couple of dozen scientists and engineers, designing radars to discriminate between Soviet ballistic missiles and their decoys, applying advanced technology to make the space station cheaper, better, and sooner, and finally helping to sell the Delta launch vehicle as the workhorse for NASA orbital payloads.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. In addition, I ran one project in the late '60s to find out how UFOs work. We didn't find out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. And had one project on remote viewing, both of them proprietary.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. My involvement with question documents came shortly after I had retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1993.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. It was about the end of 1994 when my former colleague, Stan Friedman, from our old UFO research project, called me up and said that he had received a fax copy of an alleged war office training manual entitled "Extraterrestrial Entities in Technology, Recovery and Disposal." This is what it looks like.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. Was I interested in trying to dig deeper? The answer was yes, and I called the possessor of the 35 millimeter film from which this copy had been made, Don Berliner.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. Don was also interested in determining whether they might be genuine or fake, and he and I took the negatives to his local photo shop where we both monitored the process of reproduction and printing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. Don was further helpful in lending me the box in which the film was mailed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. It had been mailed from a drug store in La Crosse, Wisconsin on March 7th, 1994.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. And actually, you should have an attachment that permits you to see these images that are showing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. The manual itself consists of 28 numbered pages plus the cover and one document page control little i.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. There were six chapters and four appendices listed, but only the first appendix was shown.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. The manual was a simple summary of the project and a detailed set of instructions of how to handle the recovery and removal of extraterrestrial craft and living organisms or EBE's extraterrestrial biological entities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. Where to ship the parts, how to do all this, and how to deceive the public with security measures.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. It was stamped with a security caveat of top secret magic eyes only on every page.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. Of particular interest is a table that specifies where to send the parts or bodies, noting Area 51 S4 and Blue Lab WP-61, both of which have been claimed by others to involve government UFO storage facilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. Also, the authentication interest is page I, documenting removal and replacement pages and the initials of the Magic 12 operations officer involved.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. The two sets of initials are EWL and JRT. Neither person has been identified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. After I had a high quality copy available, I was able to make an appointment with a public relations person from the government printing office right here in Washington.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. A long-time employee of the public printer, Mr. McCarter, was knowledgeable and helpful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. He read the entire document while I waited, stopped several times to look more carefully, and then said something like, "Well, based on the content of this manual, I would say it was probably a fake, but there's something remarkable that makes me think twice about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. If you look closely, you'll see that some of the Z's are slightly raised."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. This was happening with the type font in the 1950s time because the less used letters, especially the Z, would get some debris on the bottom of the lead, and when they dropped down, they sometimes would not fully seat.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. This is so unusual that I would say there is no doubt at all that they were printed on one of the presses in use at that time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. We had one in this building and one in the basement of the Pentagon, and they were set up to handle top-secret jobs with all the security controls in place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. Because of the subtleties of the shape of the F and G letters, we identified the type font exactly, monotype modern, a popular one in heavy use at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. Our conclusion, this document was authentically printed by the government for some reason in 1954.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. The success of this evaluation caused Stan Friedman to call me again and say that he had someone writing to him that he had received many leaked documents from various sources, and that he lived in Big Bear Lake, a lot closer to me than he and Eastern Canada did. Therefore, with proper introduction, my wife and I visited Tim Cooper at his home there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. He said he was willing to share these documents because he wanted to determine their authenticity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. He had become interested in the topic because his father had told him a story about his own involvement in covertly printing a UFO retrieval report and had told Len Stringfield about this experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. Tim Cooper shared copies of several of his documents from several different sources that were included in October 1998 presentation to UFO Symposium jointly with my son and colleague Ryan.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. This was the first time that significant authentication reports had been presented to the UFO community, and the word spread.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. Actually, Linda was there at that meeting. The word spread resulting in a sponsor asking to further authenticate these documents and publish them widely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. The sponsor also wanted Ryan and me to make a television documentary on their authenticity, and it was produced and shown on a sci-fi channel as "The Secret."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. We decided that there was interest by other researchers, so Ryan created the website www.majesticdocuments.com for easy access to all the documents we possessed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. There are 10 sources for 103 documents, 3,800 pages. The website shows 64 of these documents, including 27 of them before 1948.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. Many of the documents we have received from multiple different sources to Tim Cooper, we have established beyond any doubt in our minds that he was not the author of any of these documents in several ways.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. We have original envelopes used to mail the documents. More importantly, we have used some forensic linguistics, including spelling errors, word and sentence length and syntax to show that Cooper's writing, of which we have a huge sample about the history of White Sands Missile Range, is inconsistent with any of the question documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. It is clear that if there were secret projects studying UFOs, there would be written records. In the days of carbon copies, leaks would be expected to happen, so plans would be made to deal with them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. Such plans would involve controlling the media as much as possible, while denigrating and discouraging reality reporting, maximizing the idea that it's easy to fake anything these days with computers. This is not true when you have original paper and ink, and recognizing that many of the documents were leaked well before 2000.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. Authentication of documents is a very orderly process. First, you establish provenance, if possible, usually unlikely for illegally leaked documents. There are two kinds of tests that can be performed, physical and intellectual.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. The physical ones involve dating ink, watermark or paper, identifying the typewriter make and model, matching the type font and press, and comparing signatures, other notations and handwriting. The intellectual tests look for anachronisms, comparing the language use, and comparing with known authentic documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. More recently, the use of computerized forensic linguistics techniques permit one to make an estimate that a specific person was or was not the author of a question document.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. Signatures can be nearly identical if created with a Autopen device that permitted Truman to sign five letters at once.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. The identification of one aspect of a question document as being anomalous often results in a skeptic accepting none of the rest of the document, even though it might be filled with accurate information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. It seems to be accepted in the intelligence community that fake documents usually, if not often, contain much valid information to help get it accepted as genuine throughout. Each part of a question document should be evaluated for its specific information and appearance and background.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. In the last decade, I have presented lectures in coordination with my son, Ryan, author of Magic Eyes Only, identifying 74 crash recoveries. My lectures are on the authenticity of the documents and the influence of the alien presence on our society.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. For me, the leaked documents, the synthesis with the literature and papers of the ufology community have provided extra insight into how we got to where we are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. The conclusion I've come to is incredibly wild, that those in charge have been successful in keeping secret the greatest story of mankind while covertly spending staggering sums to create hidden underground resources and reverse engineer the technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. Until we can quantify the alien threat, how can we know whether these actions are good or bad? Let us hope, maybe with the help of one race of good aliens, that God will maybe do the right thing to happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. Here in the Beltway, I'm told that everyone has an agenda, very few want the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help be God. I think the American people deserve most of it, we paid for it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. Thank you very much, Dr. Wood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
