He claimed that the proof that those documents are fault was cleared."},{"segment_id":133,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of the documents used a pica typeface, and he had nine documents from the National Security Council that were an elite type. Therefore, the documents were fraudulent."},{"segment_id":134,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, he made it worth my while to prove him wrong.

to the documents, the document I'm going to talk quickly about is the Top Secret Memo."},{"segment_id":175,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's a 1950 document from Canada, but I want to sort of go around the documents that talk about why this is so important."},{"segment_id":176,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you took a look at the top document called Memorandum there, you will see -- to give you some background -- in Canada, there were four different organizations that controlled UFO files."},{"segment_id":177,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was the Department of Transport."},{"segment_id":178,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was the National Research Council."},{"segment_id":179,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was the RCMP, and there was the

Americans."},{"segment_id":181,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In the late 1960s, they shut down their UFO program, and they released all the siting files, which is what all the governments are doing."},{"segment_id":182,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They're just releasing their siting files."},{"segment_id":183,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the actual discussion behind the siting files as to what does the president say, what does the head of the military think about this, what does the prime minister of Canada think about this, that is all the stuff behind."},{"segment_id":184,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That is the stuff that you will not see."},{"segment_id":185,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"People will release the siting files, but they really don't mean anything."},{"segment_id":186,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So in this memorandum, which is the document -- you've got it up there."},{"segment_id":187,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'll read just the one paragraph."},{"segment_id":188,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It says -- and what has happened here is all the documents in Canada, the siting file material, has been moved in the 1960s to the National Research Council, because nobody wants the documents, nobody knows what to do with them."},{"segment_id":189,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So the National Research Council gets stuck with these documents."},{"segment_id":190,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And this is a memo from somebody in the Department of Defense talking about the fact that Project Magnet document is in these files that have come to you."},{"segment_id":191,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he gives the warnings."},{"segment_id":192,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He says you should note here that the discussions behind Project Magnet are part of this file."},{"segment_id":193,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then he says at no time should this be made available to the public."},{"segment_id":194,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you read the very last line talking about the stuff, the discussions behind the Project Magnet files, he says a copy of the Project Magnet file is attached to this."},{"segment_id":195,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The original is attached and should not be destroyed until such time as the UFO subject has cooled off."},{"segment_id":196,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So the intention was that the Project Magnet, the material behind Project Magnet, the discussions as to what was going on would be destroyed."},{"segment_id":197,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thanks to Stanton Friedman, who's sitting beside me."},{"segment_id":198,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"A lot of that material did come out in the late 1970s."},{"segment_id":199,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I want to reference you to what they're trying to cover up, what they want to destroy."},{"segment_id":200,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you look at Magnet report number one, which we found in the files of the guy who ran the Canadian government program, you will see Project Magnet report."},{"segment_id":201,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'll refer to you to page two."},{"segment_id":202,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At the top of page two it says, \"This

then that we are faced with a substantial probability of the real existence of extraterrestrial vehicles, regardless of whether or not they fit into our scheme of things.\""},{"segment_id":204,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That was the official conclusion by the Canadian government report in 1952, which went to the Prime Minister."},{"segment_id":205,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let's go to top secret document number one."},{"segment_id":206,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is the famous top secret memo that Stanton Freeman helped force out in 1978."},{"segment_id":207,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was written in 1950, but it did not get declassified until 1978."},{"segment_id":208,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As a top secret document, the Canadian government does not deny this document."},{"segment_id":209,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It agrees that this is a legitimate document."},{"segment_id":210,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was stamped top secret."},{"segment_id":211,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was written by Wilbert B. Smith."},{"segment_id":212,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The background to it was the Canadians in 1950 had decided they were going to go to the Americans."},{"segment_id":213,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They were going to find out what the Americans knew about the flying saucer program."},{"segment_id":214,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They went down and through the military attache at the Canadian embassy, and through the Canadian embassy they asked questions of the Americans, \"Is this for real? What's going on?\""},{"segment_id":215,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And here is the conclusion that went back to the Canadian government."},{"segment_id":216,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The subject is the most highly classified subject in the United States, rated higher than the hydrogen bomb."},{"segment_id":217,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Flying saucers exist."},{"segment_id":218,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Their modus operandi is unknown, but there's a small group headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush, who is the science advisor to Roosevelt, that he's in charge of the program."},{"segment_id":219,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the fourth thing was the entire matter is considered to be of tremendous significance."},{"segment_id":220,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then the fifth point that he mentions, and this goes to Mr. Bartlett's question about how did they get here from 37 light years away."},{"segment_id":221,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said, \"I was further informed that mental phenomena may be associated with the flying saucers and that the Americans aren't doing very well because they've asked that if we're doing anything in Canada, they're willing to exchange credentials and talk to us about it.\""},{"segment_id":222,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's the top secret memo."},{"segment_id":223,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Flying saucers exist."},{"segment_id":224,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What's happened in the last 50 years has been a circus."},{"segment_id":225,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Can we go to the next document, which would be embassy document number four?"},{"segment_id":226,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is some of the documentation that was destroyed by the Canadian government."},{"segment_id":227,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was recovered because Wilbur Smith had it in his personal files."},{"segment_id":228,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I'll just read to you here."},{"segment_id":229,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is the third secretary at the Canadian embassy writing to Wilbur Smith back in Canada."},{"segment_id":230,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said, \"We are, of course, have our eyes and ears open and if anything significant should happen, you'll hear it through the right salient channel.\""},{"segment_id":231,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These are the military liaison people."},{"segment_id":232,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"\"At the instructions of the ambassador in the embassy, apart from Wright and myself, nobody is to discuss the matter with anybody.\""},{"segment_id":233,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So the Canadians have been told."},{"segment_id":234,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And on the second page of that, which is embassy number four, basically it says, \"The ambassador and I would be particularly interested in any indication that you may have heard of the possibility of an official statement.\""},{"segment_id":235,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The Canadians in 1950 were sitting."},{"segment_id":236,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They had heard that the Americans had a crash-flying saucer."},{"segment_id":237,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They had been told that this was for real."},{"segment_id":238,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And they were sitting there waiting for the Americans to make a statement."},{"segment_id":239,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I'll just leave it at that."},{"segment_id":240,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And if there's any questions, we'll go from there."},{"segment_id":241,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thanks."},{"segment_id":242,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":243,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Dr.

fooled."},{"segment_id":245,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's no doubt in your mind that the documents that you've helped with, Mr. Friedman, there's just no question."},{"segment_id":246,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And you've, I think, written a very credible statement here that these are authentic."},{"segment_id":247,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, and as a very capable person, when the top page of the document file, and the 28 pages you say were involved in this, and again, we're talking, I think what I'm understanding is that what you've authenticated is the majestic 12, which has been known as the majestic 12 stuff, which resulted in this particular."},{"segment_id":248,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you could just clarify that for me if I've got that wrong."},{"segment_id":249,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":250,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My son's website, www.majesticdocuments.com, has 64 documents in

basically it is a replication of the manual that was photographed on a 35-millimeter film."},{"segment_id":254,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So from those photographs, I was able to recreate something that would seem to be exactly what it would have been in 1954."},{"segment_id":255,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I understand. When the war office back in 1950, whatever, when the war office training manual is entitled, \"Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology Recovery and Disposal.\""},{"segment_id":256,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Correct."},{"segment_id":257,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's what it says."},{"segment_id":258,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right here."},{"segment_id":259,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then you've got, and we've seen, yeah, okay. In your opinion, as a, as clearly as a smart man, that's all I have to say."},{"segment_id":260,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Does that mean the United States government at that time thought there was a high probability that there were, there could be extraterrestrial involvement in the UFO phenomena that had been clearly observed up to that point?"},{"segment_id":261,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've got evidence of 36 and earlier and others, and Roswell materials and so forth that were recovered and something unidentified, unexplained?"},{"segment_id":262,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let me finish my question, if I could, Dr. Wood. Is that proof that the government at that time thought there was a high probability of extraterrestrial life involved, or is that an indication that the government thought it was an absolute reality that extraterrestrial was involved?"},{"segment_id":263,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because wouldn't the government, with thinking that perhaps this is the best explanation, have to prepare documents to help researchers categorize not necessarily things they had found specifically, but things that had been cited that other people had found that had been reported to them?"},{"segment_id":264,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm just trying to understand the context of Majestic 12."},{"segment_id":265,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I'm asking Dr. Wood, I'm going to get to you in a moment, as how. I can see you're eager to say something. Go ahead."},{"segment_id":266,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I think the important point is that of the documents that I have, three of them basically cite crashes associated with the so-called Battle of LA in February 1942, where one was recovered in the San Bernardino Mountains and one was salvaged by the Navy at sea. In addition to that, there was a crash."},{"segment_id":267,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They were wondering about the probability, weren't they, of whether it was ET, not the reality, that they had already come to that conclusion?"},{"segment_id":268,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, my judgment is that they recovered these craft, and immediately they decided that it was very important, because we were essentially in the war with Nazi Germany and Japan, to keep this secret."},{"segment_id":269,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And, of course, that would imply that they thought that maybe this was a Nazi maneuverable vehicle that may have been..."},{"segment_id":270,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The documents..."},{"segment_id":271,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Clearly at that time, there was a lot of respect for German and Russian and engineering on things."},{"segment_id":272,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's a..."},{"segment_id":273,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They couldn't, you know, they weren't exactly the same as what we had developed in the United States."},{"segment_id":274,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's a double top-secret memo signed by FDR that alludes to non-terrestrial objects."},{"segment_id":275,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so, clearly, the language they were using in the early '40s, before 1945, was non-terrestrial."},{"segment_id":276,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so, clearly, the government felt there's..."},{"segment_id":277,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It could even be that they felt it was the best explanation."},{"segment_id":278,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But do they have...

secret."},{"segment_id":314,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was only good detective work of you all where it's not been kept private."},{"segment_id":315,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I mean, why wouldn't he express his honest, to goodness, opinion publicly if he thought it was, hey, it was very clear."},{"segment_id":316,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was very clear from this cover letter they were going to keep it under wraps."},{"segment_id":317,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, because the document is that top secret."},{"segment_id":318,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was all classified."},{"segment_id":319,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Sure."},{"segment_id":320,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it was classified."},{"segment_id":321,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This document was forced out by Stanton Friedman in 1978."},{"segment_id":322,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, I understand."},{"segment_id":323,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It remained classified."},{"segment_id":324,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've commended him for that."},{"segment_id":325,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so there's a lot of stuff I'll talk about tomorrow behind the scenes of stuff that he was doing and the Canadians were doing that showed that they knew this was extraterrestrial."},{"segment_id":326,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But in the document, he does say the Americans say flying saucers exist."},{"segment_id":327,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's simple."},{"segment_id":328,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Flying saucers exist."},{"segment_id":329,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He went down there."},{"segment_id":330,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Tomorrow, I'll get into what he learned in the States and who was telling him what."},{"segment_id":331,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, but in the documents you have here in front of us, it doesn't."},{"segment_id":332,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Or does it?"},{"segment_id":333,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm not trying to get into any."},{"segment_id":334,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah, no."},{"segment_id":335,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It does say flying saucers exist."},{"segment_id":336,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's what they were told."},{"segment_id":337,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I see my time is up."},{"segment_id":338,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much for your answers."},{"segment_id":339,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I wish I could get out."},{"segment_id":340,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think you have something important to say and I hope we'll get it."},{"segment_id":341,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":342,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we'll come back to it."},{"segment_id":343,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Congresswoman Hooley."},{"segment_id":344,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you, Mr. Chair."},{"segment_id":345,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Again, anyone that would like to answer any of these questions would be great."},{"segment_id":346,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Have we, do we have other than what happened in Utah, do we have, or New Mexico, excuse me, do we have any other vehicles, UFOs, whatever you want to call them, do we have any of those that were crashed, shot down that we can examine?"},{"segment_id":347,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You mean publicly?"},{"segment_id":348,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Publicly."},{"segment_id":349,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's all classified."},{"segment_id":350,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's the whole point of this thing, that the evidence that's available, the hard, you know, knock on the wheels, stuff is all classified."},{"segment_id":351,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's the whole point of this thing, is that we don't have access."},{"segment_id":352,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And if you look, there's plenty of classified documents, Bob showed a good one."},{"segment_id":353,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't get access to that."},{"segment_id":354,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't have a need to know for any of that stuff."},{"segment_id":355,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"People say, what was the analysis of the material at Roswell?"},{"segment_id":356,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm not on any list for sending classified information about Roswell or Aztec or any of the other crashes."},{"segment_id":357,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So when you say, do we have, if you mean the public, no, we do not."},{"segment_id":358,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Are there bodies within governments, whether Canadian or American or Russian or English or whatever, that have that information, it's pretty clear that they do."},{"segment_id":359,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Went somewhere."},{"segment_id":360,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We'll be talking about Roswell tomorrow."},{"segment_id":361,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":362,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so we'll get into that."},{"segment_id":363,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And one postscript, this is not about a probability, sir, this is how the government wanted the collection teams, which had names and numbers, to be how they would go out to retrieve craft, how they would go out and retrieve bodies dead and alive."},{"segment_id":364,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The whole procedure of how to deal with it was written and published in this 1954."},{"segment_id":365,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And how to cover it up."},{"segment_id":366,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And how to cover it up."},{"segment_id":367,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And if I could add, my son has written a book called Magic Eyes Only, which describes 74 different crash retrieval cases with an authenticity index for each one to give you the confidence that you should have."},{"segment_id":368,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And some of them are very highly confident."},{"segment_id":369,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Some of them are questionable."},{"segment_id":370,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But we're talking about dozens of crashes that have been retrieved, all of which are classified."},{"segment_id":371,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the reports are merely from other people who have said, described the process of retrieving them."},{"segment_id":372,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":373,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What Wilbur Smith said, the Canadian guy, he states quite openly in his writings that he handled a piece that was shot off a flying saucer in 1952 over Washington by the Navy."},{"segment_id":374,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He maintained that."},{"segment_id":375,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Near the end of his life, he was dying of cancer."},{"segment_id":376,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He knew people were trying to get him to talk."},{"segment_id":377,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have a letter, I don't have it for publication, I have it, where he was asked about the crash material."},{"segment_id":378,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he said, the US has tons of it."},{"segment_id":379,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And they also have a lot of film, and then he puts it in capital."},{"segment_id":380,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It is in official, not US Air Force hands."},{"segment_id":381,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So he was hinting to people that this is for real."},{"segment_id":382,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"His son testified, he will testify, he's talked to me, he's talked to numerous people, that his father told him shortly before his death that he did see a flying saucer and the bodies outside of Washington, DC."},{"segment_id":383,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And one of his associates also saw it."},{"segment_id":384,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I talked to his top metallurgist guy, because a lot of this material was going to Canada for analysis."},{"segment_id":385,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I talked to his metallurgist and I said, how much material did you and Wilbur handle?"},{"segment_id":386,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said, tons of it."},{"segment_id":387,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Again, thank you."},{"segment_id":388,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Has this, we've talked about this occurring, unidentified flying objects in England."},{"segment_id":389,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is this a worldwide phenomena, or is it?"},{"segment_id":390,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":391,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, thank you."},{"segment_id":392,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And what do other countries do with the information they get?"},{"segment_id":393,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They usually pass it on to the United States."},{"segment_id":394,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was a crash in Varginha, Brazil, which the word is that Americans took the wreckage and the bodies."},{"segment_id":395,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah, the Secretary of State was there, Warren Christopher went there, and the deal supposedly was that they were going to put a Brazilian on the space shuttle, and that's happened shortly after they negotiated, supposedly, for the bodies and the craft."},{"segment_id":396,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Carrot and stick."},{"segment_id":397,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Why do we want to keep quiet about this?"},{"segment_id":398,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'll give you six quick reasons."},{"segment_id":399,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All right."},{"segment_id":400,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You want to figure out how, by we, everybody, you want to figure out how they work."},{"segment_id":401,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They make wonderful weapons delivery and defense systems."},{"segment_id":402,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You've got wreckage."},{"segment_id":403,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You set up your secret project."},{"segment_id":404,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Rule number one for security, you cannot tell your friends without telling your enemies."},{"segment_id":405,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They read the newspapers, too."},{"segment_id":406,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":407,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Second problem, what if the other guy figures out how they work from his wreckage before you do?"},{"segment_id":408,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You don't want him to know."},{"segment_id":409,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know."},{"segment_id":410,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He knows."},{"segment_id":411,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Weapon, counter weapon, counter, counter weapon."},{"segment_id":412,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've been playing this game a long time."},{"segment_id":413,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The third problem is what if an announcement were to be made?"},{"segment_id":414,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You picked the people trusted all over the planet, as I mentioned yesterday, you know, the Queen and the Pope saying that, indeed, some UFOs are aliens."},{"segment_id":415,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What would happen?"},{"segment_id":416,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Are we ready to deal with the increase in mental hospital admissions, all kinds of things that would go on, church attendance would go up, I presume."},{"segment_id":417,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The stock market would go down."},{"segment_id":418,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Anything that rocks the boat, the stock market goes down."},{"segment_id":419,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Are we ready to deal with those?"},{"segment_id":420,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I think one thing that would happen is that the younger generation would push for the very sensible notion of, hey, we're all earthlings."},{"segment_id":421,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What are you talking, Canadians, Americans, Greeks, Peruvians?"},{"segment_id":422,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know of any government that wants that?"},{"segment_id":423,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't."},{"segment_id":424,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The United States government doesn't want people to think of themselves as planetarians, if you are Terrans."},{"segment_id":425,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Nationalism is the only game in town on which the world operates at the moment."},{"segment_id":426,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Fourth, there are the distinct religious problems with people saying there is nobody out there."},{"segment_id":427,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's the work of the devil."},{"segment_id":428,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've been told this by certain religious people."},{"segment_id":429,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These things can't be real and there would be great distress if an announcement were to be made."},{"segment_id":430,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Fifth, people say if they're coming here and we're not going there, they're more advanced than we are."},{"segment_id":431,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That means pretty soon we'll get rid of oil."},{"segment_id":432,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There goes that industry."},{"segment_id":433,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We'll have better ground and air transportation."},{"segment_id":434,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There goes those industries."},{"segment_id":435,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Some people would say maybe that's not a bad idea, but computers -- I was going to say, I'd like a little faster airplane, but go ahead."},{"segment_id":436,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And finally, I have heard seven stories of American airplanes -- no, airplanes."},{"segment_id":437,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of them was Russian -- being destroyed by aliens chasing those aircraft."},{"segment_id":438,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the United States government does not want to release that."},{"segment_id":439,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's a long habit."},{"segment_id":440,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Bad things happen to people."},{"segment_id":441,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You don't want the public to know."},{"segment_id":442,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We shot down some Russian airplanes."},{"segment_id":443,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No word in the newspapers about them approaching the coasts, if you will."},{"segment_id":444,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's been done."},{"segment_id":445,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So if we're going to disclose, we need to have a procedure established."},{"segment_id":446,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, where do we go from here?"},{"segment_id":447,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think one thing would be to announce that there are going to be international conferences."},{"segment_id":448,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"International, dealing with the political, religious, technological, et cetera, implications here."},{"segment_id":449,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's a whole new world."},{"segment_id":450,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Everything changes."},{"segment_id":451,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's not just UFO buffs that have things changing."},{"segment_id":452,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":453,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you, Congresswoman."},{"segment_id":454,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Congresswoman Kilpatrick, please."},{"segment_id":455,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":456,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I got one for you to come back."},{"segment_id":457,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Doctor, would you please define non-terrestrial for me, please?"},{"segment_id":458,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Non-terrestrial."},{"segment_id":459,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I think the word non-terrestrial was selected in order to avoid having to say they were extraterrestrial because other possibilities would have been to come from the ocean or from beneath the surface of the Earth."},{"segment_id":460,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They just wanted to say they didn't know where they came from."},{"segment_id":461,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Also, they could have come from some other place in time."},{"segment_id":462,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There have been serious people who are, well, as was said earlier, mental processes may be important in this subject."},{"segment_id":463,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And included in those mental processes are reports where things are strange in time."},{"segment_id":464,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In fact, I think I heard yesterday somebody said his watch was off, 25 minutes, 45 minutes."},{"segment_id":465,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I think they basically were being more careful than saying extraterrestrial."},{"segment_id":466,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When they said non-terrestrial, they meant it could have come from beneath the Earth or could have come from some place in time."},{"segment_id":467,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I think we still have that possibility that, in fact, the travel procedures to go from other stars to here may include some time travel."},{"segment_id":468,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is there another terrestrial, non and extra?"},{"segment_id":469,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is there another in between or is that the scientists use or whatever?"},{"segment_id":470,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, non-terrestrial just means not here on Earth with our present society."},{"segment_id":471,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Extraterrestrial means clearly from other stars."},{"segment_id":472,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So non-terrestrials, everything else is not extraterrestrial."},{"segment_id":473,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":474,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Ah, that's the first one."},{"segment_id":475,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Do you all agree, the other three, agree with that kind of definition?"},{"segment_id":476,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Remember that that was prepared before we'd been in space."},{"segment_id":477,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But this is 2013."},{"segment_id":478,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I know that."},{"segment_id":479,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You mean the reports?"},{"segment_id":480,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes. 54, and I'm going to pull them up as soon as I get up."},{"segment_id":481,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah, 54 is before, and the British astronomer Royal in 1956 said space travel is utter bilge."},{"segment_id":482,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right, right, right, and we know that to be true today, really."},{"segment_id":483,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right, I mean, it's whatever you can't define."},{"segment_id":484,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Really, it's what I'm kind of learning."},{"segment_id":485,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Space travel is real."},{"segment_id":486,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Absolutely real."},{"segment_id":487,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Planets and universes and extraterrestrials too, it sounds like."},{"segment_id":488,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"People being in space was something that was not accepted by the astronomical community back when that was written."},{"segment_id":489,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, but today we know that's not true because we ourselves."},{"segment_id":490,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":491,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, well that's good."},{"segment_id":492,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you, doctor."},{"segment_id":493,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Appreciate that, doctor."},{"segment_id":494,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was just trying to understand it my own self."},{"segment_id":495,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"International conference."},{"segment_id":496,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm glad you said it."},{"segment_id":497,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's kind of, I didn't say it like that."},{"segment_id":498,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It needs to be an international answer to this."},{"segment_id":499,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And, Dr. Freeman, you were saying that all the other countries give their stuff to the U.S."},{"segment_id":500,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, give, maybe they sell might be better."},{"segment_id":501,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Give their thinking, their materials, their, maybe not the aircraft that they hijacked or got."},{"segment_id":502,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm coming there next because I wrote down aliens got, took over, you said the aircraft."},{"segment_id":503,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't know if it's U.S. aircraft."},{"segment_id":504,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Have aliens taken over any of our aircrafts?"},{"segment_id":505,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Oh, our airplanes chasing."},{"segment_id":506,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We chase them."},{"segment_id":507,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Do they chase us?"},{"segment_id":508,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They chase us."},{"segment_id":509,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't seem to be able to get rid of them."},{"segment_id":510,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They chase us."},{"segment_id":511,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then when we go to chase them."},{"segment_id":512,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You can't."},{"segment_id":513,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They're too fast."},{"segment_id":514,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They're too quiet."},{"segment_id":515,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They move too quickly."},{"segment_id":516,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It would be important for them to find out how quickly we can fly so they graduate."},{"segment_id":517,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know already."},{"segment_id":518,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, it took a while at the beginning."},{"segment_id":519,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"How quickly we can fly, how maneuverable we are."},{"segment_id":520,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's very important in any military situation that you know the capabilities of your enemies."},{"segment_id":521,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"People, if they're attacking you, they're your enemies."},{"segment_id":522,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Do we know theirs?"},{"segment_id":523,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We know that they exceed ours."},{"segment_id":524,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the ultimate is I'm sure we don't know."},{"segment_id":525,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's scary."},{"segment_id":526,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Of course it's scary."},{"segment_id":527,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":528,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So that's why I want the international conference."},{"segment_id":529,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's why I want you all who are scientists in this for 30, 50, 60 years to pull something together."},{"segment_id":530,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And one thing about Congress, we're good in three or four areas."},{"segment_id":531,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Mine's defense and transportation."},{"segment_id":532,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Somebody else's health and you know."},{"segment_id":533,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the scientists don't let them."},{"segment_id":534,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Someone said at this table either today or this morning I think."},{"segment_id":535,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Scientists is what everything is based on."},{"segment_id":536,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean this kind of matter."},{"segment_id":537,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's kind of subjects."},{"segment_id":538,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We do it in our big science committee and several of these members served on it."},{"segment_id":539,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Can I add something to that?"},{"segment_id":540,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Absolutely."},{"segment_id":541,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Based on what I've seen, the United States of America would block any such move."},{"segment_id":542,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They already, as an example, the United Nations under Eric Gairy from Grenada tried to get a UN group to look at UFOs."},{"segment_id":543,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the evidence is pretty substantial that the Americans did everything they could to stonewall that."},{"segment_id":544,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And in that very discussion, Grenada was able to get two resolutions, who I still think are on the books in the UN, to do

it."},{"segment_id":549,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's the thing is that are the Americans ready to give up their power to a United Nations type group that's going to tell you what to

do."},{"segment_id":566,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think everyone wants the best for their children and grandchildren."},{"segment_id":567,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I wasn't separating that out."},{"segment_id":568,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think some want to keep it right here and not share the wealth."},{"segment_id":569,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think some are satisfied with a underclass and a top class."},{"segment_id":570,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because the idea I have is it's like we're in charge

true."},{"segment_id":575,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But that's, I think, what the situation is."},{"segment_id":576,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's probably true."},{"segment_id":577,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But that doesn't move us to plan B.

doing?"},{"segment_id":612,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That kind of stuff is the stuff they're protecting."},{"segment_id":613,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's the stuff they're going to go to the grave fighting for to keep out of the public."},{"segment_id":614,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They will give you the siting files because who cares?"},{"segment_id":615,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Someone saw something in the sky."},{"segment_id":616,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That doesn't threaten them."},{"segment_id":617,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the correspondence as to what are they doing about it and what does the president and the top people who are in charge, what are they doing about it?"},{"segment_id":618,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's the kind of stuff that they don't want you to know about."},{"segment_id":619,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's what they refer to in there, the internal correspondence, which at no time should be made available to the public and should be destroyed."},{"segment_id":620,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And one of the most important leaks is the SOM 101 document because it has held up over time."},{"segment_id":621,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But remember, the origin of it was on 35 millimeter negative

this."},{"segment_id":624,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would say that all of the top secret documents have resulted from leaks from personal

only trouble is that it's all whited out."},{"segment_id":627,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They didn't really release anything."},{"segment_id":628,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They redacted, huh?"},{"segment_id":629,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Redacted is a kind way to put it."},{"segment_id":630,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The CIA has released dozens of top secret Umbra UFO

reading."},{"segment_id":633,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So these are all old stuff."},{"segment_id":634,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's all pre 1980."},{"segment_id":635,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And yet there are people saying there has been no cover up."},{"segment_id":636,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I have people tell me, Stan, the NSA is giving us what they have."},{"segment_id":637,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I say, can you read what's underneath the whiteout?"},{"segment_id":638,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, no, but one sentence per page is not enough."},{"segment_id":639,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The documents on my son's website have 27 documents before 1948, 15 before 1960, and 11 from 1968, I think, and 11 more up to 2000."},{"segment_id":640,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So a lot of them are very old."},{"segment_id":641,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Are there any recent ones?"},{"segment_id":642,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The latest one I have is 2001. 2001."},{"segment_id":643,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":644,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've been exploring how we might get this issue out of the shadows of the lunatic fringe."},{"segment_id":645,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it occurred to me that one way might be to -- there's a lot of science and so forth involved with these reports of flying saucers."},{"segment_id":646,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And a lot of ways to -- and the Air Force found ways to discredit almost 12,000 of those."},{"segment_id":647,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They allowed that only 701 they couldn't account for."},{"segment_id":648,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But when you come to the authenticity of documents, that's something almost everybody can relate to."},{"segment_id":649,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's either real or it's not real."},{"segment_id":650,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And if there are real documents where people of high levels suggested that there might be non-terrestrial, extraterrestrial, whatever it is, activities associated with this, if that got into the public, I would think that that would be a wedge."},{"segment_id":651,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Gee, these people thought there was something there."},{"segment_id":652,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What were they looking at that they thought there was something there?"},{"segment_id":653,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you were in a court and a question of the authenticity of a document came up and you were looking for a source that would be acceptable both to the prosecution and the defense, an honest broker that both sides would agree with, who would that be?"},{"segment_id":654,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The question is who would -- Well, let me ask this question the way we would ask it in a hearing in the -- I know some of these things you can't do immediately, so we'd ask you to provide for the record."},{"segment_id":655,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's a little different here, but if you would think about what this would be, I'd be very interested in knowing who that honest broker would be, that both the defense and the prosecution would agree was an expert whose judgment could be relied on."},{"segment_id":656,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One answer I can give you is the procedure that I used was to go to an expert whose name was James Black with respect to typewriter fonts."},{"segment_id":657,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's the kind of thing I'm talking about, but some organization like the FBI crime lab, but there must be some private entity out there that does this kind of thing."},{"segment_id":658,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've hired them to study some of the other documents to determine the age of the ink."},{"segment_id":659,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yep, lots of things you can look at."},{"segment_id":660,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you have the original document, the chemistry of the paper, there are a lot of things you can look at to determine authenticity of this."},{"segment_id":661,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have three documents with the original name."},{"segment_id":662,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":663,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The next thing, if there are documents whose authenticity would convince people that, gee, we really need to look at what they were looking at to say that, then what would be -- and again, think about this and get back to us."},{"segment_id":664,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What would be a vehicle that would be both agreeable and acceptable to the general public for doing this?"},{"segment_id":665,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So now we're looking for an organization, some entity that is an honest broker who everybody would agree, gee, you can count on their credibility in authenticating these documents."},{"segment_id":666,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And then we need some entity to get this in the public domain who has the courage to do it, who has the credibility to be acceptable to the general public."},{"segment_id":667,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If we can do this, maybe we can get this out of the shadows, as I say, of the lunatic fringe, which is where it is now."},{"segment_id":668,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You can see that from the press things."},{"segment_id":669,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's what people think about it."},{"segment_id":670,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's what the press thinks about it."},{"segment_id":671,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":672,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's something different from what the people think about it."},{"segment_id":673,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah, I don't know."},{"segment_id":674,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What do polls show?"},{"segment_id":675,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I haven't seen any polls on this."},{"segment_id":676,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There are more believers than nonbelievers."},{"segment_id":677,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Oh, really?"},{"segment_id":678,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":679,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, okay."},{"segment_id":680,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"By the way, 15 percent favorable rating for Congress is pretty high."},{"segment_id":681,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's more like 9 percent, and I'm looking for those 9 percent."},{"segment_id":682,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you for that challenging question."},{"segment_id":683,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You're talking about true humility."},{"segment_id":684,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I've got two minutes, so I can ask a question."},{"segment_id":685,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I want to associate myself with the remarks of Congresswoman Woolsey."},{"segment_id":686,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I know that Congresswoman Hooley and I had a private discussion on the same subject, and the Congressman here has just touched upon it."},{"segment_id":687,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What is the next step?"},{"segment_id":688,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, the next step is not going to be Congress."},{"segment_id":689,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I just do not think that's going to happen, period."},{"segment_id":690,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But there's an idea, a thought that came up one the other day, and it complements with what I think Mr. Cameron was bringing up."},{"segment_id":691,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that is the next step, and this is a great first step."},{"segment_id":692,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Make no mistake about it."},{"segment_id":693,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm not trying to minimize the progress that we're making here."},{"segment_id":694,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But an international conference not made up of the lunatic fringe of opponents or the lunatic fringe of proponents, but an international conference hopefully under the auspices of the United Nations so it's global in its character."},{"segment_id":695,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so I would hope that the lobbying would take place within the United States with or without the United States' involvement."},{"segment_id":696,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You could get it through the General Assembly."},{"segment_id":697,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, clearly you won't get it through the Security Council because we control the Security Council, and that's a hoax."},{"segment_id":698,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But you could go to the General Assembly, and you could try to get -- and since there is such apparently a body within South America that has some interest in this, you could get it passed through the General Assembly, creating a commission."},{"segment_id":699,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the beginning work of the commission would be to have an international conference."},{"segment_id":700,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So it would be a conference, not a hearing like this, but it truly would be a conference with an agenda to provide -- get papers forward, to have the analysis."},{"segment_id":701,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that would -- and then, of course, to have the economic wherewithal to video stream it in all the pertinent languages, and automatic for the United Nations. I think that that would be the next step because we're frozen."},{"segment_id":702,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And, of course, this is my own thinking, and I don't want to say that the others are associated with these remarks."},{"segment_id":703,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I have lost faith in representative government. I truly think we're in gridlock. It doesn't work."},{"segment_id":704,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so we need to make a change. What that change will be -- [applause] You can only make changes with power. You have to have power to make a change."},{"segment_id":705,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't have the power here. We have the power so that it gets to the media, and so that's the step forward."},{"segment_id":706,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, we hope that those who have funded this will think in terms of funding and effort to get the UN to get involved and to fund either privately or publicly an international conference. And so where will that take us?"},{"segment_id":707,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That will take us to a further realization that the answer is with the people."},{"segment_id":708,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's only two venues for change or the exercise of power. One is the government, wherein the problem lies, or the people."},{"segment_id":709,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The government won't, but the people are not equipped to do that under our present structure of human governance."},{"segment_id":710,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So let me leave it at that and say that we will have an hour -- a little less than an hour for lunch."},{"segment_id":711,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we will be back here at 1.45, and promptly at 1.45 we'll begin, and we look forward to -- This afternoon I think we're dealing with Roswell, and that, of course, commands a lot of attention."},{"segment_id":712,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you all."}]
