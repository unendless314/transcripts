    and sooner, and finally helping to sell the Delta launch vehicle as the workhorse for NASA orbital payloads.

    was stamped April 1954, 1954 by Majestic 12 Group with the war stamp that was in use through the early 50s before the
    Pentagon. So this is a government document? This is a government document that was printed in 1954 and if this was printed
    in 1954, it was written before 1954 and that the 1947 Roswell crashes are part of what this is talking about and I was
    only going to conclude so that you would realize how much detail in 1954 the government of the United States had not only
    about the types of craft but the types of beings that we have retrieved and we have in a variety of underground facilities.

    I worked for Bob briefly at McDonnell Douglas, I had a search done of government contract reports using the key word,
    one key word, magneto aerodynamics. 900 documents were found, of which 90% were classified. I suspect some were for black
    projects and maybe even dealing with plasmas and UFOs, which is an area I'm particularly intrigued with.
