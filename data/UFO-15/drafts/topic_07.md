## Speaker Group 20

356. [APPLAUSE] We're going to go through one round of questions.
→ {"text": "【掌聲】我們將進行一輪提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. And we will-- each of you get five minutes.
→ {"text": "你們每個人有五分鐘的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. And then when we come back after break, you'll have another chance to go through.
→ {"text": "然後休息回來後，你們還有另一輪機會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

359. So let's start with Representative Cook.
→ {"text": "那麼我們開始，請 Cook 議員提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "謝謝主席女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. Let's-- I'd first like to ask a question of our witness from the UK, Nick Pope.
→ {"text": "首先我想向我們來自英國的證人 Nick Pope 提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. I remember some of your biography from yesterday, but remind me, you did work for the Ministry of Defense in the UK.
→ {"text": "我記得你昨天介紹的一些背景，但請再提醒我一下，你確實在英國國防部工作過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. That's correct, sir, yes.
→ {"text": "是的，先生，沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. You are currently not working for the Ministry of Defense.
→ {"text": "你目前已經不在國防部工作了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. Am I correct on that?
→ {"text": "我說得對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. Correct, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. I left in 2006. 2006.
→ {"text": "我於2006年離職。2006年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. And then you've been very involved in this study of UFOs since that time.
→ {"text": "從那時起你就一直非常投入 UFO 的研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. Since you left-- well, while you were there.
→ {"text": "從你離職後——嗯，其實在職期間也是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. And certainly, you've been involved since you left.
→ {"text": "當然，離職後你一直有在參與。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. Yes, sir, in a private capacity.
→ {"text": "是的，先生，是以私人身份。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. In a private capacity, I understand, at this time.
→ {"text": "我了解，目前是以私人身份。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. OK, and of course, you're telling us-- and this is really interesting to me-- that the Ministry of Defense's project on UFOs lasted from 1953, which is essentially the same year close to when Project Blue Book in the United States started.
→ {"text": "好的，你告訴我們——這對我來說非常有趣——國防部的 UFO 專案從1953年開始，這基本上與美國藍皮書計畫開始的時間相近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Project Blue Book → 藍皮書計畫"}

374. But you went all the way to 2009 in the UK with your project, although you don't have a fancy name for it, or any name for it.
→ {"text": "但你們的專案一直持續到2009年，雖然你們沒有給它取什麼響亮的名字，或根本沒有名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. Am I right?
→ {"text": "我說得對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. If you'll excuse the pun, I think we were even worse resourced than Project Blue Book.
→ {"text": "恕我開個玩笑，我認為我們的資源甚至比藍皮書計畫還要少。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. OK, fair enough.
→ {"text": "好的，說得有理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. But you collected-- you've investigated 12,000 sightings.
→ {"text": "但你們收集了——調查了12，000起目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. And I guess it was 2007, or currently, at least, over 50,000 pages of documents have been sent to the archives for scholars like yourself and any other scholar here to be looking at.
→ {"text": "我想是從2007年開始，或者至少到目前為止，已經有超過50，000頁的文件被送到檔案館，供像你這樣的學者以及這裡的其他學者查閱。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. Am I correct?
→ {"text": "我說得對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. So they're open files.
→ {"text": "所以這些是公開檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. They are-- Or are-- well, let's explain.
→ {"text": "它們是——或者說——嗯，讓我們解釋一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

384. Tell me-- I don't want to put words in your mouth.
→ {"text": "告訴我——我不想替你說話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. What are those files?
→ {"text": "那些檔案是什麼狀態？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. Are they open, closed, kind of high clearance to get it to-- go ahead.
→ {"text": "是公開的、封閉的，還是需要高層級許可才能取得——請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. The material is at the UK National Archives website.
→ {"text": "這些資料都在英國國家檔案館的網站上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. And I'm afraid to say there is a small charge for access.
→ {"text": "恐怕要說的是，查閱需要支付少量費用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. But-- Having said that, if you're prepared to pay that small charge, they're all open.
→ {"text": "但是——話雖如此，如果你願意支付那筆小額費用，它們都是公開的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. But many of the investigators here that have been witnesses would have no problem with that small charge, I'm sure.
→ {"text": "但我相信，這裡許多擔任過證人的調查員都不會介意那筆小額費用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. So I can imagine you, being as interested as you are, have looked at a lot of these documents.
→ {"text": "所以我可以想像，像你這樣感興趣的人，一定已經查閱了很多這些文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. Or maybe you've even read every one of them.
→ {"text": "或者也許你甚至讀過了每一份文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. I don't know.
→ {"text": "我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. Would you explain to what extent you've analyzed these?
→ {"text": "能否說明一下你分析這些文件的程度？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. When I did that job, I made it my business to research back into the archive and look at the historical documents.
→ {"text": "當我做那份工作時，我特意深入研究檔案並查閱歷史文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. So I went right back to the inception.
→ {"text": "所以我一路追溯到最初的起源。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. And indeed, though the formal project started in 1953, we did have a look at some sightings on an ad hoc basis even before then.
→ {"text": "確實，雖然正式專案始於1953年，但我們在那之前就已經以臨時方式調查過一些目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. And indeed, we had some reports during the Second World War.
→ {"text": "而且確實，我們在二戰期間就有一些相關報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. At the time, the phrase "foo fighters" was used for these things, subsequently "ghost rockets."
→ {"text": "當時，這些東西被稱為『幽靈戰鬥機（Foo Fighters）』，後來又稱為『幽靈火箭』。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "foo fighters → 幽靈戰鬥機（Foo Fighters），保留原文加註"}

401. And you described what you felt was the feeling of the MOD, at least when you were in the ministry, of giving some but low probability of ET origins to the UFOs that were studied.
→ {"text": "你描述了你認為國防部的態度，至少當你在部裡的時候，對於所研究的 UFO 給予外星起源的可能性雖然存在但機率很低。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "MOD → 國防部"}

402. Am I correct in what you've testified to?
→ {"text": "我對你的證詞理解正確嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. I think it's more-- You said low probability but high consequence.
→ {"text": "我想應該是——你說的是機率低但後果嚴重。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. Certainly nobody would question high consequence.
→ {"text": "當然沒有人會質疑後果的嚴重性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. Some might question low priority.
→ {"text": "有些人可能會質疑其優先級低。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. But was that their official position with all this work done?
→ {"text": "但在做了這麼多工作之後，這是他們的官方立場嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. I think it was more a case, sir, that we couldn't rule that possibility out.
→ {"text": "先生，我認為更多的是我們無法排除那種可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. We said it was a sort of non-zero possibility.
→ {"text": "我們說這是一種非零的可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. But now I'm particularly interested, not in the official ministry position.
→ {"text": "但現在我特別感興趣的不是國防部的官方立場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. Because I know how politics works.
→ {"text": "因為我了解政治運作的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. And as you say, these are your words, sir.
→ {"text": "正如你所說，這是你的話，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. The UK acts like a lap dog to the United States.
→ {"text": "英國就像美國的跟班。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. OK, so here's what I'm going to ask you.
→ {"text": "好的，所以我要問你的是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. What's your opinion after all the research you've done?
→ {"text": "在你做了所有研究之後，你的看法是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. And based on all that stuff that you've had access to, is there an ET origin to what's obviously been accurate-- or I should say sightings of real UFOs?
→ {"text": "根據你所接觸到的所有資料，那些顯然是真實的——或者說真實 UFO 的目擊事件，是否有外星起源？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. Now having sighted-- we're just repeating the concept that having sighted a UFO is not the same thing as saying there's an extraterrestrial component.
→ {"text": "現在我們重申這個概念——目擊 UFO 並不等於說有外星成分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. I want to know your opinion of that based on all that stuff that you have investigated.
→ {"text": "我想知道根據你所調查的所有資料，你對此的看法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. I think, sir, I would say that the evidence doesn't go quite far enough for me to say personally that I am absolutely sure we're being visited.
→ {"text": "先生，我想我會說證據還不足以讓我個人確信我們正受到造訪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. But I certainly think it is compelling enough that it is a possibility.
→ {"text": "但我確實認為證據足以令人信服，這是一種可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. I know, sir, that's a fancy way of saying I don't know.
→ {"text": "先生，我知道這只是『我不知道』的一種委婉說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. I apologize.
→ {"text": "我道歉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. Fair enough.
→ {"text": "說得有理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. I've got just a minute left.
→ {"text": "我還剩一分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. So I wanted to get to Grant Cameron.
→ {"text": "所以我想提問 Grant Cameron。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. I'll be able to do that on the second round anyway.
→ {"text": "反正下一輪我還有機會提問他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. But this 1950 Wilbert Smith thing is showing illumination on a question I brought up, I think, to you or to somebody yesterday on ET-- or I should say, let's use the word bodies.
→ {"text": "但這份1950年 Wilbert Smith 的文件闡明了我昨天向你或其他人提出的一個問題，關於外星人——或者說，讓我們用『遺體』這個詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Wilbert Smith 保留原文"}

427. Bodies-- witnesses talked about bodies concurrently with seeing those bodies.
→ {"text": "遺體——證人在看到那些遺體的同時就談論過它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. And it's documented that they talked about it at the time, not a lot later.
→ {"text": "而且有文件記錄顯示他們當時就談論過，而不是很久之後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. There was something about Wilbert Smith's-- I think it was Skully Book.
→ {"text": "Wilbert Smith 的文件中有一些內容——我想是關於 Scully 的書。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Skully 應為 Scully，Frank Scully 為1950年《Behind the Flying Saucers》作者"}

430. Would you elaborate on that if you could?
→ {"text": "如果可以的話，能否詳細說明？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. I think the point that you were making yesterday was in one of the documents that says in the Project Magnet report that extraterrestrials was highly probable for the result.
→ {"text": "我想你昨天提出的重點是其中一份文件，在 Project Magnet 報告中提到外星生物是極有可能的結果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Project Magnet 保留原文"}

432. And that's when you asked, is there any documents that actually refer to extraterrestrials rather than that it's confirmed?
→ {"text": "那時你問的是，是否有任何文件實際提到外星生物，而不僅僅是說這是已確認的事實？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. So what I have put forward is this idea that when the Canadians went to the Americans, the first question they asked was related to this Frank Skully book that was published in 1950.
→ {"text": "所以我提出的觀點是，當加拿大人去找美國人時，他們問的第一個問題與這本1950年出版的 Frank Scully 的書有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Frank Skully 應為 Frank Scully"}

434. This is when the interview took place.
→ {"text": "訪談就是在這個時候進行的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. And the first question he asked is Skully's book about the crash of Aztec New Mexico, how much of that book is accurate?
→ {"text": "他問的第一個問題是，Scully 那本關於新墨西哥州阿茲特克墜毀事件的書，有多少內容是準確的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Aztec 為新墨西哥州地名"}

436. And that's when he says the vast majority of the material is accurate.
→ {"text": "而那時他說絕大部分內容是準確的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. I know the time's expired.
→ {"text": "我知道時間到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. I'll probably pick up with that on next round.
→ {"text": "下一輪我可能會繼續追問這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. Let's go to Congresswoman Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "接下來請 Kilpatrick 議員提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "謝謝主席女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. I think I want to start first with Mr. Pinotti, if I'm pronouncing that correctly.
→ {"text": "我想先從 Pinotti 先生開始，如果我的發音正確的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. Is the Vatican included in Italy's deception?
→ {"text": "梵蒂岡是否包含在意大利的調查範圍內？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "deception 應為 perception 或 investigation 之誤，依語境譯為『調查』"}

445. I know they're separate unto the country.
→ {"text": "我知道他們是獨立於國家的實體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. Do you interact with them?
→ {"text": "你們有與他們互動嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. Do they have their own beliefs about what this phenomenon is?
→ {"text": "他們對這個現象有自己的看法嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. Yes.
→ {"text": "有的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. Consider that recently, even the official term unidentified flying objects was formally translated into Latin, res inexplicate volantes, which means exactly the same thing in the old Latin tongue.
→ {"text": "請考慮到，最近即使是『不明飛行物』這個官方術語也被正式翻譯成拉丁文 res inexplicate volantes，在古老的拉丁語中意思完全相同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "res inexplicate volantes 保留拉丁原文"}

450. This was made surely because there is a definite approach in the Vatican.
→ {"text": "這樣做肯定是因為梵蒂岡對此有明確的態度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. And according to my personal opinion and to what I happened to see, well, everything began probably in 1952.
→ {"text": "根據我個人的觀點以及我碰巧看到的資料，嗯，一切可能始於1952年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. Mr. Pernati.
→ {"text": "Pernati 先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "應為 Pinotti，主席誤讀名字"}

453. Yes.
→ {"text": "是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. I've got five minutes.
→ {"text": "我有五分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. You've got 1 and 1/2 minutes.
→ {"text": "你只剩一分半鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. Let me ask, my question, my only question right now.
→ {"text": "讓我問我的問題，我現在唯一的一個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. We're going to come back.
→ {"text": "我們還會再回來提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. In 1952, we had-- No, sorry, I mean, wait, you have to wait a minute.
→ {"text": "1952年，我們有——不，抱歉，我是說，等一下，你得等一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. OK, OK.
→ {"text": "好的，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. No, I just want to ask the question.
→ {"text": "不，我只是想問這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. I'm not trying to be rude.
→ {"text": "我不是故意無禮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. Help me out, Madam Chair, because I want to get all of them on one question.
→ {"text": "主席女士幫個忙，因為我想用一個問題問到所有人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. And I'm just trying to find-- we had 10 different countries today, 11 counting Russia and 12 if we count Vatican.
→ {"text": "我只是想確認——今天我們有10個不同的國家，算上俄羅斯是11個，如果算上梵蒂岡就是12個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. So what I was trying to-- The Vatican is absolutely open to this subject because recently, the director of Specula Vaticana, which is the official astronomical observatory of the Vatican, said not only that surely UFOs exist, but they have to exist because otherwise, this would be contradictory to the doctrine of the church, of the creation of the power of God's creation.
→ {"text": "所以我想要——梵蒂岡對這個議題完全持開放態度，因為最近 Specula Vaticana（梵蒂岡天文台）的主任表示，不僅 UFO 確實存在，而且它們必須存在，因為否則這將與教會的教義、上帝創造萬能的教義相矛盾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Specula Vaticana 保留拉丁原文"}

465. In other words, we have to meet in the future aliens, and we must consider them as our brothers.
→ {"text": "換句話說，我們未來必須與外星人見面，而且我們必須視他們為我們的兄弟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. This is exactly what the official Vatican paper wrote.
→ {"text": "這正是梵蒂岡官方報紙所寫的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. OK, thank you, Mr. Pananti.
→ {"text": "好的，謝謝你，Pananti 先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "應為 Pinotti，主席再次誤讀"}

468. Thank you very much, sir.
→ {"text": "非常感謝你，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. I appreciate that.
→ {"text": "我很感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. I'm still not sure if it's one or two thoughts, but I agree with what you said.
→ {"text": "我還是不確定這是一個還是兩個想法，但我同意你說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. For all of you and all of your experiences, and I appreciate all your testimony.
→ {"text": "感謝你們所有人以及你們的所有經驗，我很感謝你們所有的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. Again, we've heard from 12 different countries today, and that's just an international phenomenon.
→ {"text": "再次強調，今天我們聽取了來自12個不同國家的證詞，這確實是一個國際現象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

474. One question I want to ask, do any of your countries have any relationship with the United States government, any NGOs here, or any nonprofits, where they would get all of your information or some of your information or come and get whatever you got?
→ {"text": "我想問一個問題，你們的國家是否與美國政府、這裡的任何非政府組織或任何非營利組織有任何關係，他們會取得你們所有的資訊或部分資訊，或者來獲取你們所擁有的任何資料？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. Do you interact with the United States on this, and do they have some of the materials that you have collected over the years?
→ {"text": "你們在這個議題上與美國有互動嗎？他們擁有你們多年來收集的一些資料嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. Let me start with you, Mr. Huneeus.
→ {"text": "讓我從你開始，Huneeus 先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

477. Well, the answer is I'm just reporting on the history of France and Russia, but I'm not their spokesman.
→ {"text": "嗯，答案是我只是報告法國和俄羅斯的歷史，但我不是他們的發言人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

478. If you don't know, it's OK.
→ {"text": "如果你不知道，沒關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

479. You can say that, too.
→ {"text": "你也可以這樣說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

480. So I wouldn't know.
→ {"text": "所以我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

481. I would imagine that the Russians and the Americans have some dialogue on this, but that's an assumption.
→ {"text": "我想像俄羅斯人和美國人在這個問題上有一些對話，但這只是假設。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

482. But no, to your knowledge, nothing where Russia may have had an incident, and the US came and got some of their-- Well, I mean, even from that clause of the nuclear thing, you know, I mean, I think there's some incidents where they must have some connections, but it certainly wouldn't be public.
→ {"text": "但就你所知，沒有俄羅斯發生過什麼事件，然後美國來取得他們的一些——嗯，我是說，即使是從核武器那件事的條款來看，你知道，我是說，我認為有些事件他們一定有些聯繫，但這肯定不會公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

483. The French, as you know, from your days in Congress, are pretty independent on their way of thinking.
→ {"text": "如你所知，從你在國會的日子起，法國人在思維方式上相當獨立。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

484. And friends with friends, cousins, actually.
→ {"text": "而且朋友歸朋友，其實算是表親。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

485. Yeah, I know we're allies, but-- Right, allies is a word.
→ {"text": "是的，我知道我們是盟友，但是——對，盟友只是一個詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

486. Allies, but they're a little independent.
→ {"text": "盟友，但他們有點獨立。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

487. So I don't think they would-- OK, and I don't want anybody to speculate.
→ {"text": "所以我不認為他們會——好的，而且我不希望任何人猜測。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

488. It's OK to say if you don't know, you don't know.
→ {"text": "如果你不知道，說不知道是可以的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. No, I don't know.
→ {"text": "不，我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

490. OK, but that's good enough.
→ {"text": "好的，但這樣就夠了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

491. And you're right about the relationships to our countries.
→ {"text": "你說的關於我們國家之間的關係是對的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

492. You're absolutely right.
→ {"text": "你完全正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

493. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

494. Mr. Paul.
→ {"text": "Paul 先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "應為 Pope，主席誤讀"}

495. Ma'am, there was some limited liaison between the USAAF Project Blue Book and the Ministry of Defense right up until Blue Book was terminated.
→ {"text": "女士，在美國陸軍航空軍藍皮書計畫與國防部之間確實有一些有限的聯繫，一直持續到藍皮書計畫終止為止。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "USAAF → 美國陸軍航空軍"}

496. Beyond that, I'm not aware of anything other than ad hoc liaison.
→ {"text": "除此之外，據我所知只有臨時性的聯繫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

497. Our terms of reference limited our investigations to the UK's air defense region.
→ {"text": "我們的職權範圍將調查限制在英國的防空區域內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

498. But we did, from time to time, through the embassies and open source, IE media, get reports from other countries.

659. I mean, they had to handle a lot of material.

666. Let me ask each of you to be very brief.
→ {"text": "讓我請你們每個人非常簡短地回答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

667. But I want to know how many of the sightings of what you know about vehicles, saucers, whatever you want to call them, how many of those are unmanned versus manned?
→ {"text": "但我想知道你們所知道的關於載具、飛碟，無論你們怎麼稱呼它們，有多少是無人駕駛的，有多少是有人駕駛的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

674. This could be that sometimes if you are close enough to the object, you may even see an occupant inside the porthole or something.
→ {"text": "這可能是因為有時如果你離物體夠近，你甚至可能看到舷窗內的乘員之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

675. Or maybe the object landed and the occupant came out.
→ {"text": "或者可能物體著陸了，然後乘員出來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

676. But in other cases when the object is at a distance, which is the majority of UFO sightings, we would have no way of knowing if it's automatically piloted or not.
→ {"text": "但在其他情況下，當物體在遠處時，這是大多數 UFO 目擊事件的情況，我們無法知道它是否是自動駕駛的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

679. And those seem to be remotely piloted vehicles, kind of early versions of what today we call drones.
→ {"text": "而那些似乎是遙控載具，有點像今天我們所謂無人機的早期版本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "remotely piloted vehicles → 遙控載具"}

→ {"text": "但這些報告可以追溯到50年代或更早，當時美國人或俄羅斯人或任何人肯定都沒有這種技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

681. I mean, this whole thing about unmanned vehicles is fairly recent.

682. I think it goes back to maybe the '70s for the first.

683. So there is no way of knowing.

684. But certainly there is a percentage that do have occupants.
→ {"text": "但肯定有一定比例是有乘員的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

685. But the exact statistics, because of the distances, there's no way of knowing.

686. Nick, do you have anything to add?

689. I have a personal bias that sightings are almost a total waste of time.

690. You can't tell anything from stuff flying around in the sky.

699. And he said that there must be a highly intelligent organism in there to fly in that.

700. So I think this is a very valuable report, because it reported by the high level military officials.
→ {"text": "所以我認為這是一份非常有價值的報告，因為它是由高階軍事官員報告的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

701. Because ordinary people do not have that kind of knowledge about aerospace.
→ {"text": "因為普通人沒有那種關於航空航天的知識。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

702. But this official, the military officers, that he considered this must be evidence of there's a high intelligence organisms flying the objects.

709. In my personal opinion, I consider that there is a big difference between the official cases and the civilian cases.
→ {"text": "在我個人看來，我認為官方案例和民間案例之間有很大的區別。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

710. For instance, in Italy, we have more than 12,000 cases taken from civilian sources.

711. And the Italian Air Force, only 400.

712. So this is a big difference.

713. But just to make my possible opinion, I frankly think that we are facing some elongated and very big motherships which may contain piloted objects.
→ {"text": "但為了表達我的可能觀點，坦白說，我認為我們面對的是一些長形的、非常大的母艦，裡面可能載有有人駕駛的物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "motherships → 母艦"}

714. And these piloted objects are not too different from our fighters, in other words.
→ {"text": "換句話說，這些有人駕駛的物體與我們的戰鬥機沒有太大不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

715. And then probably there are also remotely piloted probes.
→ {"text": "然後可能還有遙控探測器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

716. And they are probably objects no more than half a meter in diameter of dimension, this is.
→ {"text": "而且它們可能是直徑不超過半公尺的物體，就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

717. But they are probably able to fly and to give information to this strange phenomena.
