## Speaker Group 20

356. [APPLAUSE] We're going to go through one round of questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. And we will-- each of you get five minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. And then when we come back after break, you'll have another chance to go through.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. So let's start with Representative Cook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. Let's-- I'd first like to ask a question of our witness from the UK, Nick Pope.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. I remember some of your biography from yesterday, but remind me, you did work for the Ministry of Defense in the UK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. That's correct, sir, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. You are currently not working for the Ministry of Defense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. Am I correct on that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. Correct, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. I left in 2006. 2006.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. And then you've been very involved in this study of UFOs since that time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. Since you left-- well, while you were there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. And certainly, you've been involved since you left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. Yes, sir, in a private capacity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. In a private capacity, I understand, at this time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. OK, and of course, you're telling us-- and this is really interesting to me-- that the Ministry of Defense's project on UFOs lasted from 1953, which is essentially the same year close to when Project Blue Book in the United States started.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. But you went all the way to 2009 in the UK with your project, although you don't have a fancy name for it, or any name for it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. Am I right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. If you'll excuse the pun, I think we were even worse resourced than Project Blue Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. OK, fair enough.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. But you collected-- you've investigated 12,000 sightings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. And I guess it was 2007, or currently, at least, over 50,000 pages of documents have been sent to the archives for scholars like yourself and any other scholar here to be looking at.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. Am I correct?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. So they're open files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. They are-- Or are-- well, let's explain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. Tell me-- I don't want to put words in your mouth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. What are those files?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. Are they open, closed, kind of high clearance to get it to-- go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. The material is at the UK National Archives website.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. And I'm afraid to say there is a small charge for access.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. But-- Having said that, if you're prepared to pay that small charge, they're all open.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. But many of the investigators here that have been witnesses would have no problem with that small charge, I'm sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. So I can imagine you, being as interested as you are, have looked at a lot of these documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. Or maybe you've even read every one of them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. Would you explain to what extent you've analyzed these?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. When I did that job, I made it my business to research back into the archive and look at the historical documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. So I went right back to the inception.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. And indeed, though the formal project started in 1953, we did have a look at some sightings on an ad hoc basis even before then.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. And indeed, we had some reports during the Second World War.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. At the time, the phrase "foo fighters" was used for these things, subsequently "ghost rockets."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. And you described what you felt was the feeling of the MOD, at least when you were in the ministry, of giving some but low probability of ET origins to the UFOs that were studied.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. Am I correct in what you've testified to?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. I think it's more-- You said low probability but high consequence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. Certainly nobody would question high consequence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. Some might question low priority.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. But was that their official position with all this work done?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. I think it was more a case, sir, that we couldn't rule that possibility out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. We said it was a sort of non-zero possibility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. But now I'm particularly interested, not in the official ministry position.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. Because I know how politics works.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. And as you say, these are your words, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. The UK acts like a lap dog to the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. OK, so here's what I'm going to ask you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. What's your opinion after all the research you've done?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. And based on all that stuff that you've had access to, is there an ET origin to what's obviously been accurate-- or I should say sightings of real UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. Now having sighted-- we're just repeating the concept that having sighted a UFO is not the same thing as saying there's an extraterrestrial component.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. I want to know your opinion of that based on all that stuff that you have investigated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. I think, sir, I would say that the evidence doesn't go quite far enough for me to say personally that I am absolutely sure we're being visited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. But I certainly think it is compelling enough that it is a possibility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. I know, sir, that's a fancy way of saying I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. I apologize.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. Fair enough.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. I've got just a minute left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. So I wanted to get to Grant Cameron.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. I'll be able to do that on the second round anyway.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. But this 1950 Wilbert Smith thing is showing illumination on a question I brought up, I think, to you or to somebody yesterday on ET-- or I should say, let's use the word bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. Bodies-- witnesses talked about bodies concurrently with seeing those bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. And it's documented that they talked about it at the time, not a lot later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. There was something about Wilbert Smith's-- I think it was Skully Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. Would you elaborate on that if you could?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. I think the point that you were making yesterday was in one of the documents that says in the Project Magnet report that extraterrestrials was highly probable for the result.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. And that's when you asked, is there any documents that actually refer to extraterrestrials rather than that it's confirmed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. So what I have put forward is this idea that when the Canadians went to the Americans, the first question they asked was related to this Frank Skully book that was published in 1950.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. This is when the interview took place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. And the first question he asked is Skully's book about the crash of Aztec New Mexico, how much of that book is accurate?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. And that's when he says the vast majority of the material is accurate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. I know the time's expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. I'll probably pick up with that on next round.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. Let's go to Congresswoman Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. I think I want to start first with Mr. Pinotti, if I'm pronouncing that correctly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. Is the Vatican included in Italy's deception?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. I know they're separate unto the country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. Do you interact with them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. Do they have their own beliefs about what this phenomenon is?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. Consider that recently, even the official term unidentified flying objects was formally translated into Latin, res inexplicate volantes, which means exactly the same thing in the old Latin tongue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. This was made surely because there is a definite approach in the Vatican.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. And according to my personal opinion and to what I happened to see, well, everything began probably in 1952.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. Mr. Pernati.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. I've got five minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. You've got 1 and 1/2 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. Let me ask, my question, my only question right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. We're going to come back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. In 1952, we had-- No, sorry, I mean, wait, you have to wait a minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. OK, OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. No, I just want to ask the question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. I'm not trying to be rude.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. Help me out, Madam Chair, because I want to get all of them on one question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. And I'm just trying to find-- we had 10 different countries today, 11 counting Russia and 12 if we count Vatican.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. So what I was trying to-- The Vatican is absolutely open to this subject because recently, the director of Specula Vaticana, which is the official astronomical observatory of the Vatican, said not only that surely UFOs exist, but they have to exist because otherwise, this would be contradictory to the doctrine of the church, of the creation of the power of God's creation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. In other words, we have to meet in the future aliens, and we must consider them as our brothers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. This is exactly what the official Vatican paper wrote.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. OK, thank you, Mr. Pananti.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. Thank you very much, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. I appreciate that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. I'm still not sure if it's one or two thoughts, but I agree with what you said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. For all of you and all of your experiences, and I appreciate all your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. Again, we've heard from 12 different countries today, and that's just an international phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. One question I want to ask, do any of your countries have any relationship with the United States government, any NGOs here, or any nonprofits, where they would get all of your information or some of your information or come and get whatever you got?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. Do you interact with the United States on this, and do they have some of the materials that you have collected over the years?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. Let me start with you, Mr. Huneeus.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. Well, the answer is I'm just reporting on the history of France and Russia, but I'm not their spokesman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. If you don't know, it's OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. You can say that, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. So I wouldn't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. I would imagine that the Russians and the Americans have some dialogue on this, but that's an assumption.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. But no, to your knowledge, nothing where Russia may have had an incident, and the US came and got some of their-- Well, I mean, even from that clause of the nuclear thing, you know, I mean, I think there's some incidents where they must have some connections, but it certainly wouldn't be public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. The French, as you know, from your days in Congress, are pretty independent on their way of thinking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

484. And friends with friends, cousins, actually.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. Yeah, I know we're allies, but-- Right, allies is a word.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. Allies, but they're a little independent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. So I don't think they would-- OK, and I don't want anybody to speculate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. It's OK to say if you don't know, you don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. No, I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. OK, but that's good enough.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. And you're right about the relationships to our countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

492. You're absolutely right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. Mr. Paul.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. Ma'am, there was some limited liaison between the USAAF Project Blue Book and the Ministry of Defense right up until Blue Book was terminated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. Beyond that, I'm not aware of anything other than ad hoc liaison.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. Our terms of reference limited our investigations to the UK's air defense region.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. But we did, from time to time, through the embassies and open source, IE media, get reports from other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

499. Did British government, US government, or an NGO in America, or a nonprofit in America, ever come to Britain and take some of the findings, or oversee, or analyze any findings from your country?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

500. I believe that some files were exchanged.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. Yes, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

502. And I think that some of the Blue Book personnel made the odd visit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

503. And indeed, you heard the testimony of General Gabrielle, of course, coming in and taking items relating to Rendlesham.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. OK, thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. Mr. Cameron, in Canada.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. The Canadians, since 1954, have been completely silent on the subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. But I would imagine, based on the very close relationship between Canada and the United States, especially with regards to NATO, that discussions are taking place at some level, interacting material.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

508. But the Canadians are absolutely quiet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

509. They do not say anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. The American government leaks a lot of material.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. The Canadian governments have said nothing since 1954.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. OK, unlike what we heard this morning, US, in some instances, actually went to those countries and gathered the particles, the information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. Yeah, I have a story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. My father worked for the Department of Transport.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. No, hold the story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. Hold the story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. I got one minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

518. OK, it's a good story, though.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. I know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

520. We'll come back for it, second round, I promise.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. I'll give it to you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. Mr. Shili, would you comment on that, China and the US?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. Does China share anything with our government, with an NGO in America, or a nonprofit as it relates to your findings?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. And I love your testimony, by the way. 500 years and up, that's outstanding and still standing, and the economic engine of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. Tell me, does China share on this phenomenon, on the extraterrestrial UFO phenomenon with the US at all?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. Well, on this, we have some exchanges in the non-governmental area, for example, with the Rockefeller Foundation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

527. Several times, they have come to me, and we have conducted a high-level, a trilateral meeting that involves Americans, Russians, and Chinese on the UFO issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

528. We, at the meeting, talked about the fact that we have to take actions and do more research in this area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. And suggestions were made at that meeting to have a summit meeting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

530. And I was asked to start preparing for this summit meeting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. So for more than 10 years, I have been trying to make efforts and start this summit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. I have been preparing for this summit meeting on UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. And this time, the Rockefeller Foundation hosted this meeting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. They also invited me to Princeton University.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. One of the deans there met with me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. And he promised me that he will try to organize a very high-level scientist group to do research.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. And they will make an exception and take a Chinese person to join this group, to join this expert or this scientist group.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. And once the scientific research results in China have been acknowledged by this group, it will be published.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

539. And it will be acknowledged around the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. Nowadays, we have many results at hand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. We are trying to verify those results and exchange those information with other organizations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

542. So in my opinion, our next step is to become more active.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. So like me, I am the chairman of the Chinese UFO Federation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. Our work is not only to find out where those UFOs are, we also have to focus on the next step that is the high technology that is from outer space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

545. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

546. Thanks to all the panelists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. [APPLAUSE] Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. Mr. Penati, would you give us some actual examples and experiences that you learned and experienced during your many years and total involvement with these issues?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. My experience is both of private nature and also from the standpoint of officiality, because I could consult also the Italian Air Force Archives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. OK, excuse me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

552. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. Let's make sure-- let's talk about what-- Some examples. --with UFOs or-- Yes, yes. --ETs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

554. OK, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

555. Exactly, I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

556. For instance, just to make some examples, we could mention-- this could be linked to the previous question too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

557. For instance, in 1954, we had a big wave in Italy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

558. And even the ambassador of the United States in Rome was present at one of these phenomena, for instance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

559. In 1978, we had the biggest wave, more than 2,000 cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. And in these cases, we had absolutely the landing, the sightings, rather cases of objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

561. They were round objects with dome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

562. And in different cases, we had also antities on the ground.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

563. There are both close encounters of the second kind cases and also of this type.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

564. What we may say is that there is a definite pattern.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

565. In other words, in many cases, we see the same kind of event, a definite craft of a certain shape, a couple of occupants, and a lot of phenomena which may be related among them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

566. Besides, for instance, the Italian Air Force in different occasions had really the close encounters with fighters and UFOs in the skies of Italy, since 1966 to 1978, for instance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

567. There is also a photograph of one of these objects made by a Fiat G91 fighter Italian plane.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. In other words, we have a lot of materials in this 400 cases filed in the Italian Air Force archives, not only UFOs in the real sense of the word, but also unidentified submerged objects, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. Because don't forget that UFOs do not fly in the real sense of the word, but they may also interact with the hydrosphere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

570. And Italy has five seas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

571. And so there are many, many cases in which these objects entered the water and took off from the water.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

572. There are even official photographs of these cases in our country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

573. Thank you so much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

574. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

575. Mr. Pope, you say that in 2007, the MOD made a policy decision to declassify and release its entire archive of UFO files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

576. How did the public respond?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

577. How did the government respond?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

578. How did the press respond?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

579. There was extensive media interest, Congresswoman, and huge public interest, too, as a result.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

580. On the website, for example, the National Archives website-- I don't have the statistics in front of me, but it was hundreds of thousands of hits, if not more.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. And were the responses positive, or did they make fun of it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

582. A bit of both, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

583. I think some people were incredibly interested.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

584. Some people were concerned that taxpayers' money had been spent on this at all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

585. And some people thought that the whole thing was disinformation and all the good stuff was being kept back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

586. OK, thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

587. I yield my time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

588. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

589. Next, we have Representative Bartlett.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. I didn't know your name.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

591. [LAUGHTER] Is there a global website that people can go to, or do you have to go to a lot of individual ones?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

592. There's no master link that can tie you into all this stuff?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

593. OK, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

594. Mr. Panetti, you mentioned you investigated Roswell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. What does that mean, and what did you conclude?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

596. Simply, I was here in the States in 1991 when these cases were absolutely not known like today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

597. And I succeeded, when they were still alive, to contact some of the witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

598. For instance, the former lieutenant Hoth, just to make an example.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

599. And other people, Dennis Stacey and so on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

600. Besides, there were other links.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

601. You surely know the case of Colonel Philip Corso and all the story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

602. And what did you conclude?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

603. What was your conclusion?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

604. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

605. My personal conclusion is that the case is absolutely true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

606. Besides, I have also a personal-- What's true?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

607. No, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

608. That it was a balloon?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

609. Is that what's true?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

610. No, no, absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

611. That we were facing an extraterrestrial spaceship.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

612. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

613. Besides, a very interesting thing is this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

614. When I was a military in 1971 and '72, and I was in Italy for the Netto Third Mysill Brigade, I had a uniform, of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

615. And on that occasion, I was ordered to prepare a lecture for my unit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

616. And I did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

617. Well, I was in touch also with an American artillery captain, because in that period, of course, in Netto, we were all together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

618. And he came and told me, oh, Lieutenant Pinotti, I know you are preparing this interesting lecture.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

619. OK.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

620. You know, in the USA, we have the crashed objects, and even the corpses of the pilots.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

621. Well, you can understand that in 1971 and 1972, we knew that all this were rubbish, that all this did not exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

622. Only the Scully cases were known and was considered not in a positive way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

623. So frankly, at that time, I thought that this guy was out of mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

624. Frankly, today, I do not know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

625. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

626. Mr. Schille, you said that a cover-up was unacceptable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

627. Unacceptable to your organization?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

628. Unacceptable to your government?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

629. Unacceptable to your military?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

630. Which?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

631. Does your government consider cover-up unacceptable?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

632. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

633. It's unacceptable.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

634. But now, looking at what the Chinese government thinks, I don't think they're exactly there yet, because the Chinese government doesn't have as much information on ET as that held by the US government, such as the remains of these ETs and so on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

635. But I can also tell you this, on the issue of UFO or flying objects, the Chinese government is still very interested.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

636. We have a commander for the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

637. Before that person takes office, they would often come to me and talk to me before they take office.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

638. And also, a lot of people in the Air Force come talk to us and say that, oh, UFO is a big issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

639. We have to go talk to you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

640. We have to talk to the Chinese UFO Federation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

641. So all in all, in China, the people in the government see this as a military issue, a security issue, which is not entirely the same as our approach.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

642. So the government is not trying to cover up anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

643. But they see this as still confidential, because they think this is a national security and a military issue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

644. We have some examples here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

645. We have been notified some sightings by the government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

646. And they seek our suggestions and opinions sometimes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

647. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

648. Thank you, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

649. Mr. Cameron.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

650. Excuse me, you have 30 seconds. 30 seconds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

651. I saw the sign.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

652. I have a good eyesight.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

653. Someone might say of a girl that she has tons of lipstick on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

654. Now, there's tons of material that the United States is supposed to have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

655. Is that figurative or literal?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

656. I think both.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

657. Figurative.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

658. When I asked the medallurgist how much they handled, he just said tons of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

659. I mean, they had to handle a lot of material.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

660. Did he mean like tons of lipstick or literal tons of stuff?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

661. His son tells numerous stories about seeing boxes, cars coming, military cars delivering material.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

662. There's a lot of discussion about material coming to Wilbur Smith for analysis in Canada.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

663. The sign says my time is up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

664. Another round, thanks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

665. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

666. Let me ask each of you to be very brief.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

667. But I want to know how many of the sightings of what you know about vehicles, saucers, whatever you want to call them, how many of those are unmanned versus manned?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

668. Do you know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

669. I mean, is there sort of a ratio or most of these without somebody so-called driving it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

670. Because that's how far my imagination goes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

671. That's a really good question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

672. We don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

673. Because Dr. Heineck, who was the famous advisor for Blue Book, who later became very pro-euphology, well, he came up with the term close encounters of the third kind for those cases where, besides the UFO, occupants were seen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

674. This could be that sometimes if you are close enough to the object, you may even see an occupant inside the porthole or something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

675. Or maybe the object landed and the occupant came out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

676. But in other cases when the object is at a distance, which is the majority of UFO sightings, we would have no way of knowing if it's automatically piloted or not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

677. Then we have cases where we have large objects, which obviously must be manned by someone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

678. And then out of the large object, small little probes come.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

679. And those seem to be remotely piloted vehicles, kind of early versions of what today we call drones.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

680. But these are reported as far back as the '50s or something when certainly the Americans or the Russians or whatever did not have access to this kind of technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

681. I mean, this whole thing about unmanned vehicles is fairly recent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

682. I think it goes back to maybe the '70s for the first.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

683. So there is no way of knowing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

684. But certainly there is a percentage that do have occupants.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

685. But the exact statistics, because of the distances, there's no way of knowing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

686. Nick, do you have anything to add?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

687. Madam Chair, of the roundabout 12,000 UFO reports that MOD received in the time of the UFO project, only perhaps a few dozen involve the sighting of any entities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

688. OK, Mr. Cameron?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

689. I have a personal bias that sightings are almost a total waste of time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

690. You can't tell anything from stuff flying around in the sky.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

691. It's not until you interact with whoever is flying them or get inside the ship that you can learn anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

692. You really can't determine very much from watching whether it's their stuff, their stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

693. It's just stuff flying around in the sky.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

694. It just shows you that something very mysterious is going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

695. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

696. Mr. Shelley?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

697. There is a higher level Air Force official that he gave me a UFO report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

698. He reported that he has seen that dozens of UFOs that have lined up and are flying in the same direction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

699. And he said that there must be a highly intelligent organism in there to fly in that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

700. So I think this is a very valuable report, because it reported by the high level military officials.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

701. Because ordinary people do not have that kind of knowledge about aerospace.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

702. But this official, the military officers, that he considered this must be evidence of there's a high intelligence organisms flying the objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

703. And so in this high level military officers, he often joined and participated in our seminars as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

704. And he even gave me a picture of the UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

705. This is something very special.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

706. That was a picture that's taken from the satellite.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

707. And that was very clear, crisp, clear picture of a UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

708. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

709. In my personal opinion, I consider that there is a big difference between the official cases and the civilian cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

710. For instance, in Italy, we have more than 12,000 cases taken from civilian sources.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

711. And the Italian Air Force, only 400.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

712. So this is a big difference.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

713. But just to make my possible opinion, I frankly think that we are facing some elongated and very big motherships which may contain piloted objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

714. And these piloted objects are not too different from our fighters, in other words.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

715. And then probably there are also remotely piloted probes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

716. And they are probably objects no more than half a meter in diameter of dimension, this is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

717. But they are probably able to fly and to give information to this strange phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

718. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

719. Thank you very much for your time and your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

720. It was a terrific panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

721. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

722. And we are adjourned until 3:30.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

723. [APPLAUSE]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
