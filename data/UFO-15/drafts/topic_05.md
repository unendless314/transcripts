230. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. Madam Chair, Representatives, Senator, you should all have a printed out copy of my opening statement but with your permission, I'll read it onto the record.

## Speaker Group 15

232. Okay, thank you.

## Speaker Group 16

233. The UK Ministry of Defense is an organization broadly analogous to the US Department of Defense and has a dual role both as a policymaking department of state and as the UK's highest level military headquarters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. I worked there for 21 years as a civilian, three of which were spent on MOD's UFO project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. That's a job I had from 1991 to 1994.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. The MOD's UFO project ran from 1953 to 2009 and in that time, over 12,000 sightings were investigated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. MOD's role here was to research and investigate the phenomenon to determine whether there was evidence of any potential threat to the defense of the UK or anything of more general defense interest.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. The UK's interest in UFOs had its roots in concerns that some objects might be foreign military aircraft on reconnaissance missions or on missions to test the capabilities and effectiveness of our air defense network, both in terms of radar and air defense aircraft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. The work we did was very similar to the work done by the US government's UFO program embedded in the United States Air Force under a number of different project names, the best known of which was Project Blue Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. The UK's program had no formal project name.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. Our conclusions were that most sightings could be explained as misidentifications of known objects or phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. However, around 5% appeared to defy conventional explanation and were of considerable interest.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. We took no position on the nature of these sightings and remained open-minded as to the possibilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. Accordingly, while we were aware of no evidence that would support the theory that any UFO sightings were attributable to extraterrestrial life, we didn't entirely rule out that possibility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. It was regarded as a low-probability, high-consequence scenario, which is why from time to time the possibility was at least considered in internal MOD discussions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. Despite the wider societal implications, MOD's interest was narrowly focused on technology acquisition.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. Scientific and technical intelligence experts in MOD's defense intelligence staff were not averse to speculating about exotic energy sources, propulsion systems or aerodynamics in relation to UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. And perhaps the most graphic illustration of this was a defense intelligence staff document from 1995 which read in part, "If the sightings are of devices not of this earth, then their purpose needs to be established as a matter of priority.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. There has been no apparent hostile intent and other possibilities are, one, military reconnaissance, two, scientific, three, tourism."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. [ Laughter ] The intent was practical as the document went on to set out, quote, "We could use this technology if it exists."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. Though we accepted UFO reports from everyone, and indeed the vast majority of those reports came to us from the public, the sightings that were of most interest were those where the witnesses were police officers, pilots, or military personnel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. And when I say pilots, I mean both civil aircraft pilots and military pilots.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

253. We were also particularly interested in sightings where there was some corroborative evidence, e.g. in terms of radar data or a photograph or film that specialist imagery analysis staff could evaluate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. Of particular concern to us were a number of incidents where there were near misses between UFOs and commercial aircraft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. There are several such cases in the MOD's UFO files and in the files of the Civil Aviation Authority, which is a UK government agency broadly equivalent to the US FAA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. The UK's best known and most compelling UFO incident is a series of sightings that occurred in December 1980, collectively known as either the Rendlesham Forest incident or the Bentwaters incident, and the committee has already taken evidence on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. In the late '90s, the MOD's defense intelligence staff commissioned a review of many of the UFO sightings that MOD had investigated over the years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

258. This intelligence analysis was known as Project Condign, which was a randomly generated code word.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. And this attempted some trend analysis of the reports received as opposed to reinvestigation of individual cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. The final report was published in the year 2000 and ran to over 400 pages.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. The title was Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Air Defense Region.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. The MOD often uses the phrase UAP, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, in internal correspondence, so as to avoid the unfortunate stigma that comes from the term UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. At the time, Project Condyne's final report was classified secret UK eyes only.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. Its controversial conclusion was that some UFO sightings might be attributable to exotic atmospheric plasmas, and that there might be novel military applications, e.g. in terms of directed energy weapons, that might merit further study.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. Again, the air safety implications of the phenomenon were judged to be an important part, and one recommendation of the study read as follows, no attempt should be made to outmaneuver a UAP during interception.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. Another recommendation stated, at higher altitudes, although UAP appear to be benign to civil air traffic, pilots should be advised not to maneuver other than to place the object astern if possible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. A redacted version of Project Condyne's final report was made available to the public in May 2006, following a number of Freedom of Information Act requests.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. There is in the UK, as in the US, a widely held belief that the authorities know more about UFOs than they're telling the public, i.e. that there's a coverup and a conspiracy on the subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. I think there are two relevant factors here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. Firstly, the MOD was and still is an inherently secretive organization despite the introduction of the UK's Freedom of Information Act.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. Secondly, it was the longstanding policy of the MOD to downplay the extent of the department's interest and the scope of our official research and investigation, not all of which, especially post-Freedom of Information Act, generated the paper trail that one might expect and hope for.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. To give a practical example of this, we consistently told the UK's Parliament, the media and the public that UFOs were of limited interest and "no defense significance," while highly classified intelligence studies such as Project Condyne were being carried out away from public scrutiny.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. That said, despite the secrecy and despite the downplaying of MOD's UFO-related work, I'm not aware of any coverup or conspiracy in the sense that proponents of such theories mean.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. MOD's UFO project was terminated in 2009 as part of a wider series of defense cuts, and while the public no longer have an official point of contact for their sightings, pilots can and do continue to make reports on an ad hoc basis, though they tend to avoid the phrase UFO or indeed UAP.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. And in my experience now tend to use phrases such as "unusual aircraft."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. In 2007, the MOD made a policy decision to declassify and release its entire archive of UFO files, following a similar decision made by the French government in 2007.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. This five-year program, in which I've been personally involved, began with the release of the first batch of files in May 2008.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. Subsequent batches followed, and the program reaches its climax this year.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. To date, over 50,000 pages of documents have been sent to the UK's National Archives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. The UK and France are two of a number of nations that have opened their UFO files recently in response to pressure from media and the public, and again, the committee's had some testimony on that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. In concluding, I should say that I do not have a single neat explanation for the UFO mystery, and neither am I aware that anyone in the UK government has or had reached a definitive conclusion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. However, having undertaken three years of official UK government research and investigation into the UFO phenomenon, my belief, my assessment, is that whatever the true nature of the phenomenon, it raises important defense, national security, and air safety issues.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. Additionally, as pointed out in Project Condine's final report, there are potential novel technology applications and military applications that may result from a proper scientific study of the phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. And finally, and perhaps most importantly in relation to this event, and I think we heard it most graphically with the testimony from Sergeants Penniston and Burroughs and their ongoing quest for their medical records, I think it's clear that, again, whatever the nature of this phenomenon and this mystery, there are issues of political accountability, open government, and freedom of information here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. [ Applause ]
