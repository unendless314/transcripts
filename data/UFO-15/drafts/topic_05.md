229. Mr. Pope, welcome back.
→ {"text": "波普先生，歡迎回來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

230. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. Madam Chair, Representatives, Senator, you should all have a printed out copy of my opening statement but with your permission, I'll read it onto the record.
→ {"text": "主席女士、各位議員、參議員，各位應該都已經收到了我的開場陳述書面稿，但經過您的許可，我將在會議記錄上朗讀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

232. Okay, thank you.
→ {"text": "好的，謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

233. The UK Ministry of Defense is an organization broadly analogous to the US Department of Defense and has a dual role both as a policymaking department of state and as the UK's highest level military headquarters.
→ {"text": "英國國防部（Ministry of Defence）是一個與美國國防部大致類似的機構，具有雙重角色：既是國家的政策制定部門，也是英國最高層級的軍事指揮總部。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Ministry of Defence 首次出現，加註中文"}

234. I worked there for 21 years as a civilian, three of which were spent on MOD's UFO project.
→ {"text": "我以文職人員身分在那裡工作了21年，其中有三年負責英國國防部的UFO專案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. That's a job I had from 1991 to 1994.
→ {"text": "這是我在1991年至1994年間擔任的職務。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. The MOD's UFO project ran from 1953 to 2009 and in that time, over 12,000 sightings were investigated.
→ {"text": "英國國防部的UFO專案從1953年運作至2009年，在此期間調查了超過12，000起目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. MOD's role here was to research and investigate the phenomenon to determine whether there was evidence of any potential threat to the defense of the UK or anything of more general defense interest.
→ {"text": "英國國防部在此的角色是研究和調查這個現象，以確定是否有任何對英國國防構成潛在威脅的證據，或任何更廣泛的國防利益相關事項。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. The UK's interest in UFOs had its roots in concerns that some objects might be foreign military aircraft on reconnaissance missions or on missions to test the capabilities and effectiveness of our air defense network, both in terms of radar and air defense aircraft.
→ {"text": "英國對UFO的關注源於一種擔憂：某些物體可能是外國軍用飛機執行偵察任務，或是執行測試我國防空網路能力與效能的任務，包括雷達和防空戰機方面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. The work we did was very similar to the work done by the US government's UFO program embedded in the United States Air Force under a number of different project names, the best known of which was Project Blue Book.
→ {"text": "我們所做的工作與美國政府的UFO計畫非常相似，該計畫隸屬於美國空軍，曾使用多個不同的專案名稱，其中最著名的是藍皮書計畫（Project Blue Book）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. The UK's program had no formal project name.
→ {"text": "英國的計畫沒有正式的專案名稱。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. Our conclusions were that most sightings could be explained as misidentifications of known objects or phenomena.
→ {"text": "我們的結論是，大多數目擊事件可以解釋為對已知物體或現象的誤認。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. However, around 5% appeared to defy conventional explanation and were of considerable interest.
→ {"text": "然而，約有5%的事件似乎無法用常規解釋，並具有相當大的研究價值。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. We took no position on the nature of these sightings and remained open-minded as to the possibilities.
→ {"text": "我們對這些目擊事件的性質不持任何立場，對各種可能性保持開放態度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. Accordingly, while we were aware of no evidence that would support the theory that any UFO sightings were attributable to extraterrestrial life, we didn't entirely rule out that possibility.
→ {"text": "因此，雖然我們沒有發現任何證據支持UFO目擊事件可歸因於外星生命的理論，但我們並未完全排除這種可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. It was regarded as a low-probability, high-consequence scenario, which is why from time to time the possibility was at least considered in internal MOD discussions.
→ {"text": "這被視為一種低機率、高後果的情境，這就是為什麼在英國國防部內部討論中，這種可能性至少不時會被考慮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. Despite the wider societal implications, MOD's interest was narrowly focused on technology acquisition.
→ {"text": "儘管這個現象具有更廣泛的社會影響，英國國防部的關注點卻狹隘地集中在技術獲取方面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. Scientific and technical intelligence experts in MOD's defense intelligence staff were not averse to speculating about exotic energy sources, propulsion systems or aerodynamics in relation to UFOs.
→ {"text": "英國國防部國防情報參謀部門的科學與技術情報專家，並不排斥對與UFO相關的異常能源、推進系統或空氣動力學進行推測。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. And perhaps the most graphic illustration of this was a defense intelligence staff document from 1995 which read in part, "If the sightings are of devices not of this earth, then their purpose needs to be established as a matter of priority.
→ {"text": "這一點最生動的例證，或許是1995年一份國防情報參謀文件，其中部分內容寫道：「如果這些目擊事件涉及非地球裝置，那麼確定其目的必須列為優先事項。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. There has been no apparent hostile intent and other possibilities are, one, military reconnaissance, two, scientific, three, tourism."
→ {"text": "目前沒有明顯的敵意，其他可能性包括：一、軍事偵察；二、科學研究；三、觀光旅遊。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. [ Laughter ] The intent was practical as the document went on to set out, quote, "We could use this technology if it exists."
→ {"text": "【笑聲】文件的意圖是實際的，正如文件接著闡述的：「如果這項技術存在，我們可以利用它。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. Though we accepted UFO reports from everyone, and indeed the vast majority of those reports came to us from the public, the sightings that were of most interest were those where the witnesses were police officers, pilots, or military personnel.
→ {"text": "雖然我們接受來自所有人的UFO報告，而且絕大多數報告確實來自民眾，但我們最感興趣的是那些由警察、飛行員或軍事人員擔任證人的目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. And when I say pilots, I mean both civil aircraft pilots and military pilots.
→ {"text": "當我說飛行員時，我指的是民航機飛行員和軍用飛行員兩者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. We were also particularly interested in sightings where there was some corroborative evidence, e.g. in terms of radar data or a photograph or film that specialist imagery analysis staff could evaluate.
→ {"text": "我們也特別關注那些有佐證證據的目擊事件，例如雷達數據，或是專業影像分析人員可以評估的照片或影片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. Of particular concern to us were a number of incidents where there were near misses between UFOs and commercial aircraft.
→ {"text": "特別令我們關注的是一系列UFO與民航機險些相撞的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. There are several such cases in the MOD's UFO files and in the files of the Civil Aviation Authority, which is a UK government agency broadly equivalent to the US FAA.
→ {"text": "英國國防部的UFO檔案以及民航局（Civil Aviation Authority）的檔案中都有數起這類案例，民航局是英國政府機構，大致相當於美國的聯邦航空總署（FAA）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. The UK's best known and most compelling UFO incident is a series of sightings that occurred in December 1980, collectively known as either the Rendlesham Forest incident or the Bentwaters incident, and the committee has already taken evidence on this.
→ {"text": "英國最著名且最具說服力的UFO事件，是1980年12月發生的一系列目擊事件，統稱為倫德爾沙姆森林事件（Rendlesham Forest incident）或本特沃特斯事件（Bentwaters incident），委員會已經就此聽取了證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. In the late '90s, the MOD's defense intelligence staff commissioned a review of many of the UFO sightings that MOD had investigated over the years.
→ {"text": "1990年代末，英國國防部國防情報參謀部委託進行了一項審查，檢視該部多年來調查的許多UFO目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. This intelligence analysis was known as Project Condign, which was a randomly generated code word.
→ {"text": "這項情報分析被稱為康代因計畫（Project Condign），這是一個隨機生成的代號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. And this attempted some trend analysis of the reports received as opposed to reinvestigation of individual cases.
→ {"text": "這項研究嘗試對收到的報告進行趨勢分析，而非重新調查個別案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. The final report was published in the year 2000 and ran to over 400 pages.
→ {"text": "最終報告於2000年發布，篇幅超過400頁。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. The title was Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Air Defense Region.
→ {"text": "報告標題為《英國防空區域內的不明空中現象》（Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Air Defense Region）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. The MOD often uses the phrase UAP, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, in internal correspondence, so as to avoid the unfortunate stigma that comes from the term UFO.
→ {"text": "英國國防部在內部通信中經常使用UAP（不明空中現象，Unidentified Aerial Phenomena）一詞，以避免UFO這個術語所帶來的不幸污名。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. At the time, Project Condyne's final report was classified secret UK eyes only.
→ {"text": "當時，康代因計畫的最終報告被列為「僅限英國閱覽機密」（secret UK eyes only）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 Condyne 應為 Condign 之誤，依 topics.json 註記說明"}

264. Its controversial conclusion was that some UFO sightings might be attributable to exotic atmospheric plasmas, and that there might be novel military applications, e.g. in terms of directed energy weapons, that might merit further study.
→ {"text": "該報告具爭議的結論是，某些UFO目擊事件可能歸因於異常大氣電漿體，而且可能存在新穎的軍事應用，例如定向能源武器方面，值得進一步研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. Again, the air safety implications of the phenomenon were judged to be an important part, and one recommendation of the study read as follows, no attempt should be made to outmaneuver a UAP during interception.
→ {"text": "同樣地，這個現象對飛航安全的影響被認為是重要的一環，研究的一項建議如下：在攔截過程中，不應試圖以機動動作超越UAP。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. Another recommendation stated, at higher altitudes, although UAP appear to be benign to civil air traffic, pilots should be advised not to maneuver other than to place the object astern if possible.
→ {"text": "另一項建議指出，在較高海拔，雖然UAP對民航交通似乎無害，但應建議飛行員不要進行機動動作，除非可能將該物體置於機尾方向。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "astern 在此指飛機後方，航空術語"}

267. A redacted version of Project Condyne's final report was made available to the public in May 2006, following a number of Freedom of Information Act requests.
→ {"text": "經過多項資訊自由法（Freedom of Information Act）申請後，康代因計畫最終報告的刪節版本於2006年5月向公眾公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 Condyne 應為 Condign 之誤"}

268. There is in the UK, as in the US, a widely held belief that the authorities know more about UFOs than they're telling the public, i.e. that there's a coverup and a conspiracy on the subject.
→ {"text": "在英國，如同在美國，普遍存在一種信念：當局對UFO的了解比他們向公眾透露的還要多，也就是說，存在著對這個議題的真相掩蓋和陰謀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. I think there are two relevant factors here.
→ {"text": "我認為這裡有兩個相關因素。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. Firstly, the MOD was and still is an inherently secretive organization despite the introduction of the UK's Freedom of Information Act.
→ {"text": "首先，儘管英國實施了資訊自由法，英國國防部過去和現在都是一個本質上保密的機構。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. Secondly, it was the longstanding policy of the MOD to downplay the extent of the department's interest and the scope of our official research and investigation, not all of which, especially post-Freedom of Information Act, generated the paper trail that one might expect and hope for.
→ {"text": "其次，英國國防部長期以來的政策是淡化該部門的關注程度以及我們官方研究和調查的範圍，其中並非所有活動——特別是資訊自由法實施後——都產生了人們所期望和期待的書面記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. To give a practical example of this, we consistently told the UK's Parliament, the media and the public that UFOs were of limited interest and "no defense significance," while highly classified intelligence studies such as Project Condyne were being carried out away from public scrutiny.
→ {"text": "舉個實際的例子，我們一貫向英國國會、媒體和公眾表示，UFO只是有限度的關注對象，「不具有國防重要性」，而同時像康代因計畫這樣的高度機密情報研究卻在遠離公眾監督的情況下進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 Condyne 應為 Condign 之誤"}

273. That said, despite the secrecy and despite the downplaying of MOD's UFO-related work, I'm not aware of any coverup or conspiracy in the sense that proponents of such theories mean.
→ {"text": "話雖如此，儘管存在保密以及對英國國防部UFO相關工作的淡化，但我並未察覺到任何真相掩蓋或陰謀——我是指那些理論支持者所說的那種意義上的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. MOD's UFO project was terminated in 2009 as part of a wider series of defense cuts, and while the public no longer have an official point of contact for their sightings, pilots can and do continue to make reports on an ad hoc basis, though they tend to avoid the phrase UFO or indeed UAP.
→ {"text": "英國國防部的UFO專案於2009年終止，作為一系列更廣泛國防預算削減的一部分；雖然公眾不再有官方聯絡窗口來通報目擊事件，但飛行員確實可以並且確實繼續以臨時方式提交報告，儘管他們傾向於避免使用UFO或甚至UAP這樣的詞彙。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. And in my experience now tend to use phrases such as "unusual aircraft."
→ {"text": "根據我的經驗，他們現在傾向於使用諸如「不尋常飛行器」這樣的詞語。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. In 2007, the MOD made a policy decision to declassify and release its entire archive of UFO files, following a similar decision made by the French government in 2007.
→ {"text": "2007年，在法國政府做出類似決定之後，英國國防部做出政策決定，將其全部UFO檔案解密並公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. This five-year program, in which I've been personally involved, began with the release of the first batch of files in May 2008.
→ {"text": "這項為期五年的計畫——我個人也參與其中——於2008年5月開始發布第一批檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. Subsequent batches followed, and the program reaches its climax this year.
→ {"text": "後續批次陸續發布，而這項計畫在今年達到高潮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. To date, over 50,000 pages of documents have been sent to the UK's National Archives.
→ {"text": "迄今為止，已有超過50，000頁的文件被送交英國國家檔案館（UK's National Archives）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. The UK and France are two of a number of nations that have opened their UFO files recently in response to pressure from media and the public, and again, the committee's had some testimony on that.
→ {"text": "英國和法國是近期在媒體和公眾壓力下公開其UFO檔案的眾多國家之一，而且委員會已經就此聽取了一些證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. In concluding, I should say that I do not have a single neat explanation for the UFO mystery, and neither am I aware that anyone in the UK government has or had reached a definitive conclusion.
→ {"text": "總結來說，我應該說我對UFO之謎沒有一個簡潔明確的解釋，而且據我所知，英國政府中也沒有人曾經或已經得出確定性結論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. However, having undertaken three years of official UK government research and investigation into the UFO phenomenon, my belief, my assessment, is that whatever the true nature of the phenomenon, it raises important defense, national security, and air safety issues.
→ {"text": "然而，在進行了三年英國政府官方的UFO現象研究與調查之後，我的信念、我的評估是：無論這個現象的真實本質為何，它都提出了重要的國防、國家安全和飛航安全議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. Additionally, as pointed out in Project Condine's final report, there are potential novel technology applications and military applications that may result from a proper scientific study of the phenomenon.
→ {"text": "此外，正如康代因計畫最終報告所指出的，對這個現象進行適當的科學研究，可能會帶來潛在的新穎技術應用和軍事應用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 Condine 應為 Condign 之誤"}

284. And finally, and perhaps most importantly in relation to this event, and I think we heard it most graphically with the testimony from Sergeants Penniston and Burroughs and their ongoing quest for their medical records, I think it's clear that, again, whatever the nature of this phenomenon and this mystery, there are issues of political accountability, open government, and freedom of information here.
→ {"text": "最後，或許與本次聽證會最相關且最重要的是——我想我們從彭尼斯頓中士和伯勞斯中士的證詞，以及他們持續尋求醫療記錄的過程中，最生動地聽到了這一點——我認為很清楚的是，再次強調，無論這個現象和這個謎團的本質為何，這裡存在著政治問責、開放政府和資訊自由的議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. [ Applause ]
→ {"text": "【掌聲】", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
