## Speaker Group 11

143. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Some of what I have is repetitive of yesterday, so I'm just going to summarize just the first part of my testimony, which you have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. I have added, however, some documents, which are as handwritten files here, which I'll refer to near the end.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. As I mentioned yesterday, the records for the Canadian investigation, all these records are online.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. The Canadian government does not dispute any of the material that is online.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. It should be pointed out, I believe, that the Canadian investigation from 1950 to 1954 was the most open investigation of any in the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. In fact, they didn't even use the word UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. They used the word flying saucers and flying disks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. It was very open. 1954, as I'll explain, an incident occurred.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. It was shut down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. The lights went off, and that was the end of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. My testimony is based on these files and also on the personal files of Wilbert B. Smith, who was a superintendent of radio regulations for the Department of Transport and who also headed the government UFO investigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. Basically, what the story comes down to, it centers around the top secret memo, which I described yesterday.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. The Canadians went to the Americans in 1950.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. They wanted to find out what the Americans knew about the flying saucer phenomena, and through the military attache at the Canadian embassy and through the Canadian embassy, they made inquiries to officials at the Research and Development Board.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. And all that material was summed up and put in the top secret memo, which I put on record yesterday.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. And basically, it was summed up saying that the Americans notified the Canadians flying saucers were real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. It was the most highly classified subject in the United States, rated two points higher than the hydrogen bomb.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. A small group headed up by President Roosevelt's former science advisor, Vannevar Bush, was in charge of the investigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. The fourth point was the American officials considered the matter to be of tremendous significance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. And the fifth item, the American officials notified the Canadians that other things might be associated with the saucers, such as mental phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. And this mental phenomena aspect was later confirmed by two high level American sources.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. Smith left his personal records, which we recovered.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. And it showed that he was in contact with Vannevar Bush.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. The Canadian flying saucer investigation shows that besides tracking sighting reports, a flying saucer detection station, which I think we have a photo of, had been set up on a property provided by the Defense Research Board in Canada, where the Canadians were trying to detect a flying saucer, and actually did on August the 8th, 1954.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. The Canadians also-- and this was announced in a speech by Paul Hellyer in 1967, when he was the defense minister-- that in 1954, the Canadians actually opened up a base, a top secret base at Suffield, Alberta, for flying saucers to land.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. The Canadians had made contact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. They had initiated a contact, which I can describe later, where they wanted to fly over the flying saucer observatory, which it did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. And they had plans which were approved at one point by the Prime Minister of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Department of Defense to land a flying saucer at Suffield, Alberta.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. On August the 8th, 1954, the flying saucer observatory recorded an unknown object flying over.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. And this can actually be seen in FBI documents to describe the planning for this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. When this was written up in the press, the flying saucer investigation was completely shut down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. Nothing really happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. All the Canadians followed the American lead in the late 1960s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. They shut the program down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. All the files are moved to the National Research Council.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. The files today are actually sent to a researcher in my city, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. None of the top secret, none of the secret, but all the siting reports are actually sent to an investigator from the Canadian government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. And that investigator puts out a report every year based upon those sitings and other sitings that he gets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. After Wilbur Smith's personal files were made public in 1982, more details related to the United States-Canadian Joint Flying Saucer Investigation were made public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. Smith's letters showed that he was receiving UFO hardware from the United States authorities to analyze.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. When I asked his metallurgist, Arthur Bridge, how much material they had actually handled, he replied, tons of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. In interviews with Smith shortly before his death, he told a group of visiting researchers from Ohio that the United States military has tons of hardware, and they also had much film.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. Smith spelled out to researchers that the hardware was controlled by US government officials and not the US Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. Smith's oldest son testified on record a number of times that his father confirmed to him before he died that he had been shown a downed flying saucer and the bodies by American officials.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. Smith's files were identified two sources, Dr. Vannevar Bush and Dr. Robert Sarbacher, who-- these are the letters I'd like to refer to now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. Dr. Robert Saubacher was identified by the Saturday Evening Post as the boy genius.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. He ran the Washington Institute of Technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. He was the dean of graduate studies at Georgia Tech.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. And in the 1950s, he co-authored a university textbook on hyper and ultra-high frequency engineering for US universities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. He was one of the main contacts that the Canadians were put in contact with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. And you can see on the opening of the Saubacher notes here, I have highlighted one particular point because one of the congressmen brought up yesterday whether we have a document that actually talks about alien bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. This is a transcript that Wilbur Smith made of the interview that was done at the Canadian Embassy in September of 1950.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. And he's talking to Saubacher and the question he asks, and I have it highlighted there, I have read Scully's book on the saucers and would like to know how much of it is true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. The Scully book was a book written on crash flying saucers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. It reported to be a crash at Aztec New Mexico in March of 1948 recovering bodies and a craft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. Smith asked Saubacher how much of this book is true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. Saubacher's reply is the facts reported in the book are substantially correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. I'd also like to refer to you what happened was in 1982 Wilbur Smith's files were made public and everybody learned the fact that Saubacher was the main witness in the United States providing material to the Canadians and everybody started to chase him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. Stanton Friedman has an extensive audio interview with him that you can actually get on the internet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. I refer you to a letter here from the Washington Institute of Technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. This is to a researcher in California, Bill Steinman, who writes to Dr. Saubacher and trying to confirm to him, is this true, what is the deal here?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. Saubacher had told Stanton Friedman that what had happened was in 1950 there was a briefings at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base of a downed saucer and bodies that he couldn't go to the meeting but he was in the Navy office in Washington DC and listened to all the high ranking scientists who had come back from the briefing and told him what was going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. In this letter on page two he basically says, I recall the interview with Dr. Bremner at the Canadian Embassy, I think I gave the answer so he confirms these handwritten briefings that I, or notes that I showed you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. He said, the only thing I can remember is that certain materials reported to come from flying saucers were extremely light and very tough.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. I'm sure the laboratories analyzed them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. And then he confirms in this letter that he signs in 1983 that there were bodies, that he was told about bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. In the interview with Stanton Friedman, he's a little more specific but you have a letter here of a high ranking American official that the Canadians got in contact with that confirmed that the Americans did have bodies and they did have a craft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. What he did, and this is the last part of my testimony, Stanton Friedman was talking to him and he said, can you tell me who was at the meeting?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. He identified a number of people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. All the people that he identified were dead until he came to the fact that there was one person from Pennsylvania who was at all the meetings and knew what was going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. That engineer, Dr. Eric Walker, confirmed to Bill Steinman that he had attended the Wright-Patterson Air Force meetings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. Walker had held many top jobs such as 15 years as the President of Penn State University.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. He was Chairman of the Board of the Institute for Defense Analysis, the top military think tank used by the Department of Defense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. He was Chairman of the National Science Foundation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. He was Executive Secretary of the Research and Development Board and headed the Navy's Applied Research Lab at State College, Pennsylvania.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. In discussions with more than half a dozen researchers over eight years, Dr. Walker tried not to talk about the subject, but he did confirm that there were ET recoveries, communication with aliens, and that there was a secret control group that was overseeing the entire subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. After Dr. Walker's death, his son, Brian Walker, confirmed that there had been a file that contained a number of official government documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. He claimed he did not read them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. He recalls that there were drawings, but did not mention whether it was of bodies or disks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. He claimed that the file containing the information in Penn-- there was information about a crash in Pennsylvania and one in the western United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. He thinks he just-- his father destroyed the file before his death because when he moved the files from the house to Penn State University, the file was no longer there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. And that's my statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
