291. So good afternoon distinguished members and panelists of the Citizen Hearing on UFOs.
→ {"text": "各位UFO公民聽證會的尊貴成員和與會專家，下午好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. Today we're discussing official investigations from various countries around the world.
→ {"text": "今天我們要討論來自世界各國的官方調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. Among those nations that have conducted some kind of official UFO research besides the United States and South America, which have been dealt in previous sessions, we can mention Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Ukraine, Poland, Australia, and New Zealand to cite a few.
→ {"text": "除了美國和南美洲已在先前會議中討論過之外，進行過某種官方UFO研究的國家還包括俄羅斯、英國、法國、比利時、西班牙、意大利、瑞典、丹麥、烏克蘭、波蘭、澳洲和紐西蘭等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. We have with us experts that will discuss or had just discussed some of these countries like Italy, the UK, Canada, and China, but no representatives from the other nations.
→ {"text": "我們現場有專家將要或已經討論過其中一些國家，如意大利、英國、加拿大和中國，但其他國家則沒有代表出席。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. So I will cover briefly the history of official investigations of two particularly important countries, France and Russia, which have a rich amount of material in this field.
→ {"text": "因此，我將簡要介紹兩個特別重要國家的官方調查歷史：法國和俄羅斯，這兩個國家在這個領域擁有豐富的資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. Let's start with France, a country that has one of the oldest, continuous, and most rational approaches to the UFO problem.
→ {"text": "讓我們從法國開始，這個國家對UFO問題採取了最古老、持續最久且最理性的處理方式之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. Some military investigations in France go back to the '50s, but the current program really took off in the mid-'70s when a series of important steps were taken by the French government.
→ {"text": "法國的一些軍事調查可追溯至1950年代，但目前的計畫真正起步於1970年代中期，當時法國政府採取了一系列重要措施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. In 1974, the Minister of Defense, Robert Galli, admitted in a famous radio interview that, quote, "The massive reports coming in from the gendarmerie were pretty disturbing."
→ {"text": "1974年，國防部長羅貝爾·加利在一次著名的廣播訪問中承認，『來自憲兵隊的大量報告相當令人不安。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Robert Galli 保留原文"}

299. The minister added that, quote, "I believe that the attitude of spirit that we must adopt vis-a-vis the phenomenon is an open one, that is to say that it doesn't consist in denying a priori as our ancestors of previous centuries did deny many things that seem nowadays perfectly elementary," end quote.
→ {"text": "這位部長補充說，『我相信我們面對這個現象必須採取的態度是開放的，也就是說，不應像前幾個世紀的祖先那樣先驗地否定許多如今看來完全基本的事物。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. The National Gendarmerie, which is a national police force, similar to our state troopers, had been investigating UFO incidents since the '60s, including a famous UFO landing and close encounter of the third kind, CE-3, cases where humanoid beings or UFO occupants are seen in connection with the sighting in Valensole in 1965.
→ {"text": "國家憲兵隊是類似美國州警的國家警察部隊，自1960年代起就一直在調查UFO事件，包括1965年瓦朗索勒著名的UFO著陸和第三類接觸案件，在這些案件中目擊者看到了類人生物或UFO乘員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "National Gendarmerie 譯為國家憲兵隊，Valensole 譯為瓦朗索勒"}

301. Ten years later, the gendarmerie formalized its UFO protocols by issuing instructions that gendarmes throughout the French territory, including those overseas like French Guyana or Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, should respond and investigate any UFO incident reported by French citizens.
→ {"text": "十年後，憲兵隊通過發布指令正式確立了UFO調查程序，要求法國全境的憲兵，包括法屬圭亞那或印度洋留尼旺島等海外地區的憲兵，對法國公民通報的任何UFO事件做出回應並進行調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. These protocols are still current.
→ {"text": "這些程序至今仍然有效。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. In 1977, the Institute of High Studies of National Defense, or IHEDN, a key think tank of the French military, released an important study which recommended establishment of a permanent agency to study UFOs.
→ {"text": "1977年，國家防禦高等研究院（IHEDN），一個法國軍方的重要智庫，發布了一項重要研究，建議設立一個常設機構來研究UFO。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "IHEDN 保留原文縮寫"}

304. This was accomplished later that year when the CNAS, the French space agency equivalent to our NASA, created the study group of unidentified aerospace phenomena, GEPAN, under the direction of aerospace engineer Claude Poher, who had conducted UFO research on his own for a number of years.
→ {"text": "同年稍晚，相當於美國NASA的法國太空總署CNES成立了不明航空現象研究組（GEPAN），由航空工程師克勞德·波埃爾領導，他多年來一直獨立進行UFO研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "CNES/GEPAN/Claude Poher 保留原文"}

305. One of his first tasks was to conduct a statistical study of 354 UFO cases collected by the gendarmerie, 25% of which remained unexplained.
→ {"text": "他的首要任務之一是對憲兵隊收集的354起UFO案件進行統計研究，其中25%仍未得到解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. On the morning of January 8, 1981, GEPAN's most important case took place.
→ {"text": "1981年1月8日上午，GEPAN最重要的案件發生了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. A UFO landed on the property of a farmer in Transan-Provence in the Valle region of southwest France.
→ {"text": "一架UFO降落在法國西南部瓦爾地區普羅旺斯特朗一位農民的田地上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Trans-en-Provence 譯為普羅旺斯特朗"}

308. Although the case had only one witness, the farmer Renato Nicolai, the case became important because of the physical evidence left by the UFO on the alfalfa field, which was analyzed scientifically by a number of French laboratories.
→ {"text": "雖然這起案件只有一位目擊者，農民雷納托·尼科萊，但這起案件因UFO在苜蓿田上留下的物理證據而變得重要，這些證據由多家法國實驗室進行了科學分析。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Renato Nicolai 保留原文"}

309. Among other things, the alfalfa leaves lost from 30 to 50% of chlorophyll, and the traces on the terrain were still perceptible 40 days after the event, according to the official report.
→ {"text": "根據官方報告，苜蓿葉失去了30%至50%的葉綠素，而且地面上的痕跡在事件發生後40天仍然清晰可見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. Stranger still was what an official GEPAN chart-- and I don't know if we have it on the-- I had given it previously, so hopefully it will appear on the screen, the chart.
→ {"text": "更奇怪的是GEPAN官方圖表上的內容——我不知道現在螢幕上有沒有——我之前已經提供過，希望圖表能出現在螢幕上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. Stranger was what an official GEPAN chart characterized as, quote, "time-space effect."
→ {"text": "更奇怪的是GEPAN官方圖表所描述的『時空效應』。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. Professor Buñaz, one of the scientists who conducted the analysis, explained that while the plants were physiologically young, after the UFO landing, they presented-- and I'm quoting now-- "the biochemical characteristics of leaves of an advanced age," old leaves.
→ {"text": "進行分析的一位科學家布尼亞茲教授解釋說，雖然這些植物在生理上很年輕，但在UFO著陸後，它們呈現出——我現在引用——『老年葉片的生化特徵』，也就是老葉子。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Buñaz 保留原文，發音可能為 Bounias"}

313. So in other words, they were young plants.
→ {"text": "換句話說，它們是年輕的植物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. After the UFO landed, they became biochemically old.
→ {"text": "在UFO著陸後，它們在生化層面變老了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. And that, according to the scientists, doesn't happen in nature.
→ {"text": "根據科學家的說法，這在自然界中是不會發生的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. The final conclusion of the GEPAN chart was, quote, "physical phenomenon of unexplained nature, high probability of electromagnetic mode of propulsion."
→ {"text": "GEPAN圖表的最終結論是，『性質未明的物理現象，極有可能是電磁推進模式。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. Despite this and other significant cases investigated and documented by GEPAN, the agency was downgraded in the mid-'80s, and the name was changed to SEPRA, an acronym for the Reentry of Atmospheric Objects.
→ {"text": "儘管GEPAN調查並記錄了這起及其他重要案件，該機構在1980年代中期被降級，名稱改為SEPRA，是大氣物體重返的縮寫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "SEPRA 保留原文"}

318. Although the agency continued to investigate UFO cases under the direction of Jean-Jacques Velasco, who was the case investigator of the Trans-en-Provence incident.
→ {"text": "雖然該機構在讓-雅克·貝拉斯克的領導下繼續調查UFO案件，他是普羅旺斯特朗事件的案件調查員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Jean-Jacques Velasco 保留原文"}

319. In 2007, however, a new reorganization took place, and the name was changed again to GEPAN-- so they added an I there-- Study and Information Group of Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena.
→ {"text": "然而，2007年進行了新的重組，名稱再次更改為GEIPAN——他們在那裡加了一個I——不明航空現象研究與資訊組。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "GEIPAN 保留原文"}

320. GEPAN also launched a comprehensive website and began the process of releasing all of its documents, which are now available within the CNS portal.
→ {"text": "GEPAN還推出了一個全面的網站，並開始發布所有文件的程序，這些文件現在可在CNES入口網站上查閱。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. That's the French Space Agency.
→ {"text": "也就是法國太空總署。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. Parallel to the official GEPAN and gendarmerie investigations, there has also been some highly interesting semi-official reports from groups connected to the French military, intelligence, and aeronautical establishment.
→ {"text": "與GEPAN和憲兵隊的官方調查平行，與法國軍方、情報機構和航空機構有關的團體也發布了一些非常有趣的半官方報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. The first and most famous one was the so-called cometa report of 1999, entitled UFOs and Defense-- What Should We Prepare For?
→ {"text": "第一個也是最著名的是1999年的所謂COMETA報告，標題為《UFO與國防——我們應該準備什麼？》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "COMETA Report 譯為 COMETA報告"}

324. Although not an official government report in the strict sense of the word, cometa was composed of a group of retired, high ranking military and intelligence officers under the direction of retired Major General Dennis Letty.
→ {"text": "雖然嚴格來說不是官方政府報告，但COMETA是由一群退役的高級軍事和情報官員組成，由退役少將丹尼斯·萊蒂領導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Dennis Letty 保留原文"}

325. Their conclusion that UFOs were definitely real and most likely of extraterrestrial origin were very strong.
→ {"text": "他們的結論非常明確：UFO確實存在，而且極有可能來自外太空。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. More recently, another quasi-official organization, the 3AF, which stands for the Aeronautical and Astronomical Association of France, created a high level study group known as the Sigma Commission under the direction of Alain Boudier.
→ {"text": "最近，另一個準官方組織3AF，即法國航空天文協會，在阿蘭·布迪埃的領導下成立了一個高層研究小組，稱為西格瑪委員會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "3AF/Sigma Commission/Alain Boudier 保留原文"}

327. Sigma has recently completed a long report, again confirming the existence of a real UFO phenomenon of likely ET origin.
→ {"text": "西格瑪委員會最近完成了一份長篇報告，再次確認了確實存在極有可能來自外星的UFO現象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. From all of this material briefly outlined in this presentation, you can see that the French are undoubtedly among the leading nations to conduct significant UFO research, both officially and semi-officially.
→ {"text": "從本簡報中概述的所有這些資料可以看出，法國無疑是進行重要UFO研究的領先國家之一，無論是官方還是半官方層面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. Instead of burying their heads in the sand, pretending that a UFO phenomenon doesn't exist or is not important, France, the cradle of rationalism in the modern era, have taken an aggressive approach towards solving this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "法國是現代理性主義的搖籃，他們沒有埋頭沙中假裝UFO現象不存在或不重要，而是採取了積極的方式來解決這個現象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. Let me outline now very briefly the history of UFO research in Russia and the old Soviet Union.
→ {"text": "現在讓我簡要概述俄羅斯和前蘇聯的UFO研究歷史。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. In the early days of communism, the subject of UFOs was heavily censored, although some research was conducted privately by a few scientists, such as the late Professor Felix Siegel, an astronomer with the Moscow Aviation Institute who is considered the father of Russian ufology.
→ {"text": "在共產主義早期，UFO主題受到嚴格審查，儘管一些科學家私下進行了研究，例如已故的費利克斯·西格爾教授，他是莫斯科航空學院的天文學家，被認為是俄羅斯幽浮學之父。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Felix Siegel 保留原文"}

332. Things began to change after a highly publicized event in Petrosovodsk in Karelia, northern Russia in September of 1977, which led to the creation of a commission for the study of anomalous phenomena attached to the USSR Academy of Sciences.
→ {"text": "1977年9月，俄羅斯北部卡累利阿地區彼得羅扎沃茨克發生了一起廣受關注的事件後，情況開始改變，這導致蘇聯科學院成立了一個研究異常現象的委員會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Petrozavodsk/Karelia 保留原文，譯為彼得羅扎沃茨克/卡累利阿"}

333. This commission was public since it solicited reports from the Soviet citizenry.
→ {"text": "這個委員會是公開的，因為它向蘇聯公民徵求報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. Not known to the public, however, was the second secret study conducted by the KGB and the Soviet Ministry of Defense, although its existence was not revealed until after the breakdown of the USSR in 1990.
→ {"text": "然而，公眾並不知道的是，KGB和蘇聯國防部進行的第二項秘密研究，直到1990年蘇聯解體後，其存在才被揭露。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. Eventually, some military and KGB files from this commission were released in the '90s, including incidents involving UFO flyings over nuclear facilities.
→ {"text": "最終，該委員會的一些軍方和KGB檔案在1990年代被公開，包括UFO飛越核設施的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. One of the most interesting cases in the KGB file is a multiple witness CE-1 close encounter of the first kind at a top secret army missile base in the district of Kapustin Yar, Astrakhan region, on the night of July 28, 29, 1989.
→ {"text": "KGB檔案中最有趣的案件之一，是1989年7月28日至29日晚間在阿斯特拉罕地區卡普斯京亞爾地區一個最高機密陸軍飛彈基地發生的多人目擊第一類近距離接觸事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Kapustin Yar/Astrakhan 譯為卡普斯京亞爾/阿斯特拉罕"}

337. The file is surely incomplete, but still offers an interesting glimpse into the maneuverability of UFOs.
→ {"text": "這份檔案肯定不完整，但仍讓我們得以一窺UFO的機動能力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. The dossier consists of the depositions of seven military witnesses, two junior officers, a corporal, and four privates, plus illustrations of the object by the observers and a briefcase summary by an unnamed KGB officer.
→ {"text": "這份卷宗包含七名軍方證人的證詞，包括兩名初級軍官、一名下士和四名士兵，以及目擊者繪製的物體圖示和一名匿名KGB官員撰寫的摘要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. One of the depositions mentions a disc-shaped object moving, quote, "in the direction of the rocket's weapons depot," and then hovering over the depot and emitting a bright beam.
→ {"text": "其中一份證詞提到一個碟形物體朝『火箭武器庫的方向』移動，然後在庫房上空盤旋並發出明亮的光束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

340. Another case from 1982 involved a series of sightings of UFOs over a nuclear missile base near Usovo, Ukraine, which coincided with the malfunction of the computerized console controlling the launch of nuclear weapons.
→ {"text": "另一起1982年的案件涉及在烏克蘭烏索沃附近一個核飛彈基地上空的一系列UFO目擊，這與控制核武發射的電腦控制台故障同時發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Usovo 譯為烏索沃"}

341. This was obviously of great concern to the Soviet military, and is quite similar to the events at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana discussed in another session of these hearings.
→ {"text": "這顯然是蘇聯軍方極為關切的事，與本次聽證會另一場會議中討論的蒙大拿州馬姆斯特羅姆空軍基地事件非常相似。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Malmstrom Air Force Base 保留原文"}

342. It is perhaps due to these kinds of incidents involving nuclear weapons that a curious clause about, quote, "unidentified objects" was added to an agreement on measures to reduce the risk of nuclear war between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
→ {"text": "也許正是因為這些涉及核武器的事件，美利堅合眾國與蘇維埃社會主義共和國聯盟之間關於減少核戰風險措施的協議中，加入了一項關於『不明物體』的特殊條款。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. The agreement was part of a policy of detente during the Nixon and early Brezhnev administrations.
→ {"text": "該協議是尼克森和布里茲涅夫執政初期緩和政策的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Nixon/Brezhnev 保留原文"}

→ {"text": "該協議於1971年9月30日由國務卿威廉·羅傑斯和外交部長安德烈·葛羅米柯簽署。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "William Rogers/Andrei Gromyko 保留原文"}

345. The agreement has nine articles on issues such as informing each other, quote, "against the accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons under its control," notification in advance of missile launches that go beyond the national territory of each country, and other measures of cooperation in order to avert, quote, "the risk of outbreak of nuclear war."
→ {"text": "該協議共有九項條款，涉及相互通報『防止意外或未經授權使用其控制的核武器』、提前通知超越各國領土的飛彈發射，以及其他合作措施以避免『核戰爆發的風險』等問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. Article 3 reads, I'm quoting, "the parties undertake to notify each other immediately in the event of detection by missile warning systems of unidentified objects or in the event of signs of interference with these systems or with the related communication facilities if such occurrences could create a risk of outbreak of nuclear war between the two countries."
→ {"text": "第三條規定，我引用：『如果飛彈預警系統偵測到不明物體，或出現干擾這些系統或相關通訊設施的跡象，且此類事件可能造成兩國之間核戰爆發的風險，雙方承諾立即相互通報。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. It's a good thing that they signed this agreement.
→ {"text": "他們簽署了這項協議是一件好事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. Several UFO cases involving Russian cosmonauts have also become public over the years.
→ {"text": "多年來，涉及俄羅斯太空人的幾起UFO案件也已公開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. One of the most interesting was a report by cosmonaut Major General Vladimir Kovalyonok from the Salyut 6 space station on May 5, 1981.
→ {"text": "其中最有趣的一個是1981年5月5日，太空人弗拉基米爾·科瓦廖諾克少將從禮炮6號太空站發出的報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Vladimir Kovalyonok/Salyut 6 譯為弗拉基米爾·科瓦廖諾克/禮炮6號"}

350. The sighting of a pulsating round object, which resembled a melon-- that's his quote-- and then became like a barbell and didn't resemble any cosmic objects unfamiliar with, was admitted on the record in a videotaped interview by the cosmonaut many years later.
→ {"text": "這個脈動的圓形物體，看起來像一顆甜瓜——這是他的原話——然後變得像一個槓鈴，與他所熟悉的任何宇宙物體都不相似，這位太空人在多年後的錄影訪談中正式承認了這次目擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. Another cosmonaut, Major General Pavel Popovich, even became, at one point, the president of the All Union Ufology Association of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
→ {"text": "另一位太空人帕維爾·波波維奇少將甚至曾經擔任獨聯體全國幽浮學協會的主席。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Pavel Popovich 譯為帕維爾·波波維奇"}

352. A quote from a 1992 paper by General Popovich provides an appropriate ending to this brief presentation.
→ {"text": "波波維奇將軍1992年的一篇論文引用，為這個簡短的報告提供了恰當的結尾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. He wrote, quote, "The UFO sightings have become the constant component of human activity and require a serious global study.
→ {"text": "他寫道，『UFO目擊已成為人類活動的常態組成部分，需要認真的全球性研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. In order to realize the position of man on Earth and in the universe, ufology, the scientific study of the UFO phenomenon, should take place in the midst of other sciences dealing with man and the world."
→ {"text": "為了理解人類在地球和宇宙中的位置，幽浮學，即對UFO現象的科學研究，應該與其他研究人類和世界的科學並列。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
