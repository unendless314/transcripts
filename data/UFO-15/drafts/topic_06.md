## Speaker Group 19

289. Welcome back.

## Speaker Group 20

290. Thank you.

291. So good afternoon distinguished members and panelists of the Citizen Hearing on UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. Today we're discussing official investigations from various countries around the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. Among those nations that have conducted some kind of official UFO research besides the United States and South America, which have been dealt in previous sessions, we can mention Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Ukraine, Poland, Australia, and New Zealand to cite a few.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. We have with us experts that will discuss or had just discussed some of these countries like Italy, the UK, Canada, and China, but no representatives from the other nations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. So I will cover briefly the history of official investigations of two particularly important countries, France and Russia, which have a rich amount of material in this field.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. Let's start with France, a country that has one of the oldest, continuous, and most rational approaches to the UFO problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. Some military investigations in France go back to the '50s, but the current program really took off in the mid-'70s when a series of important steps were taken by the French government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. In 1974, the Minister of Defense, Robert Galli, admitted in a famous radio interview that, quote, "The massive reports coming in from the gendarmerie were pretty disturbing."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. The minister added that, quote, "I believe that the attitude of spirit that we must adopt vis-a-vis the phenomenon is an open one, that is to say that it doesn't consist in denying a priori as our ancestors of previous centuries did deny many things that seem nowadays perfectly elementary," end quote.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. The National Gendarmerie, which is a national police force, similar to our state troopers, had been investigating UFO incidents since the '60s, including a famous UFO landing and close encounter of the third kind, CE-3, cases where humanoid beings or UFO occupants are seen in connection with the sighting in Valensole in 1965.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. Ten years later, the gendarmerie formalized its UFO protocols by issuing instructions that gendarmes throughout the French territory, including those overseas like French Guyana or Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, should respond and investigate any UFO incident reported by French citizens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. These protocols are still current.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. In 1977, the Institute of High Studies of National Defense, or IHEDN, a key think tank of the French military, released an important study which recommended establishment of a permanent agency to study UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. This was accomplished later that year when the CNAS, the French space agency equivalent to our NASA, created the study group of unidentified aerospace phenomena, GEPAN, under the direction of aerospace engineer Claude Poher, who had conducted UFO research on his own for a number of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. One of his first tasks was to conduct a statistical study of 354 UFO cases collected by the gendarmerie, 25% of which remained unexplained.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. On the morning of January 8, 1981, GEPAN's most important case took place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. A UFO landed on the property of a farmer in Transan-Provence in the Valle region of southwest France.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. Although the case had only one witness, the farmer Renato Nicolai, the case became important because of the physical evidence left by the UFO on the alfalfa field, which was analyzed scientifically by a number of French laboratories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. Among other things, the alfalfa leaves lost from 30 to 50% of chlorophyll, and the traces on the terrain were still perceptible 40 days after the event, according to the official report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. Stranger still was what an official GEPAN chart-- and I don't know if we have it on the-- I had given it previously, so hopefully it will appear on the screen, the chart.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. Stranger was what an official GEPAN chart characterized as, quote, "time-space effect."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. Professor Buñaz, one of the scientists who conducted the analysis, explained that while the plants were physiologically young, after the UFO landing, they presented-- and I'm quoting now-- "the biochemical characteristics of leaves of an advanced age," old leaves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. So in other words, they were young plants.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. After the UFO landed, they became biochemically old.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. And that, according to the scientists, doesn't happen in nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. The final conclusion of the GEPAN chart was, quote, "physical phenomenon of unexplained nature, high probability of electromagnetic mode of propulsion."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. Despite this and other significant cases investigated and documented by GEPAN, the agency was downgraded in the mid-'80s, and the name was changed to SEPRA, an acronym for the Reentry of Atmospheric Objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. Although the agency continued to investigate UFO cases under the direction of Jean-Jacques Velasco, who was the case investigator of the Trans-en-Provence incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. In 2007, however, a new reorganization took place, and the name was changed again to GEPAN-- so they added an I there-- Study and Information Group of Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. GEPAN also launched a comprehensive website and began the process of releasing all of its documents, which are now available within the CNS portal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. That's the French Space Agency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. Parallel to the official GEPAN and gendarmerie investigations, there has also been some highly interesting semi-official reports from groups connected to the French military, intelligence, and aeronautical establishment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. The first and most famous one was the so-called cometa report of 1999, entitled UFOs and Defense-- What Should We Prepare For?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. Although not an official government report in the strict sense of the word, cometa was composed of a group of retired, high ranking military and intelligence officers under the direction of retired Major General Dennis Letty.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. Their conclusion that UFOs were definitely real and most likely of extraterrestrial origin were very strong.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. More recently, another quasi-official organization, the 3AF, which stands for the Aeronautical and Astronomical Association of France, created a high level study group known as the Sigma Commission under the direction of Alain Boudier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. Sigma has recently completed a long report, again confirming the existence of a real UFO phenomenon of likely ET origin.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. From all of this material briefly outlined in this presentation, you can see that the French are undoubtedly among the leading nations to conduct significant UFO research, both officially and semi-officially.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. Instead of burying their heads in the sand, pretending that a UFO phenomenon doesn't exist or is not important, France, the cradle of rationalism in the modern era, have taken an aggressive approach towards solving this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. Let me outline now very briefly the history of UFO research in Russia and the old Soviet Union.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. In the early days of communism, the subject of UFOs was heavily censored, although some research was conducted privately by a few scientists, such as the late Professor Felix Siegel, an astronomer with the Moscow Aviation Institute who is considered the father of Russian ufology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. Things began to change after a highly publicized event in Petrosovodsk in Karelia, northern Russia in September of 1977, which led to the creation of a commission for the study of anomalous phenomena attached to the USSR Academy of Sciences.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. This commission was public since it solicited reports from the Soviet citizenry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. Not known to the public, however, was the second secret study conducted by the KGB and the Soviet Ministry of Defense, although its existence was not revealed until after the breakdown of the USSR in 1990.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. Eventually, some military and KGB files from this commission were released in the '90s, including incidents involving UFO flyings over nuclear facilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. One of the most interesting cases in the KGB file is a multiple witness CE-1 close encounter of the first kind at a top secret army missile base in the district of Kapustin Yar, Astrakhan region, on the night of July 28, 29, 1989.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. The file is surely incomplete, but still offers an interesting glimpse into the maneuverability of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. The dossier consists of the depositions of seven military witnesses, two junior officers, a corporal, and four privates, plus illustrations of the object by the observers and a briefcase summary by an unnamed KGB officer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. One of the depositions mentions a disc-shaped object moving, quote, "in the direction of the rocket's weapons depot," and then hovering over the depot and emitting a bright beam.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. Another case from 1982 involved a series of sightings of UFOs over a nuclear missile base near Usovo, Ukraine, which coincided with the malfunction of the computerized console controlling the launch of nuclear weapons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. This was obviously of great concern to the Soviet military, and is quite similar to the events at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana discussed in another session of these hearings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. It is perhaps due to these kinds of incidents involving nuclear weapons that a curious clause about, quote, "unidentified objects" was added to an agreement on measures to reduce the risk of nuclear war between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. The agreement was part of a policy of detente during the Nixon and early Brezhnev administrations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. It was signed on September 30, 1971, by Secretary of State William Rogers and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. The agreement has nine articles on issues such as informing each other, quote, "against the accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons under its control," notification in advance of missile launches that go beyond the national territory of each country, and other measures of cooperation in order to avert, quote, "the risk of outbreak of nuclear war."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. Article 3 reads, I'm quoting, "the parties undertake to notify each other immediately in the event of detection by missile warning systems of unidentified objects or in the event of signs of interference with these systems or with the related communication facilities if such occurrences could create a risk of outbreak of nuclear war between the two countries."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. It's a good thing that they signed this agreement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. Several UFO cases involving Russian cosmonauts have also become public over the years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. One of the most interesting was a report by cosmonaut Major General Vladimir Kovalyonok from the Salyut 6 space station on May 5, 1981.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. The sighting of a pulsating round object, which resembled a melon-- that's his quote-- and then became like a barbell and didn't resemble any cosmic objects unfamiliar with, was admitted on the record in a videotaped interview by the cosmonaut many years later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. Another cosmonaut, Major General Pavel Popovich, even became, at one point, the president of the All Union Ufology Association of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. A quote from a 1992 paper by General Popovich provides an appropriate ending to this brief presentation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. He wrote, quote, "The UFO sightings have become the constant component of human activity and require a serious global study.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. In order to realize the position of man on Earth and in the universe, ufology, the scientific study of the UFO phenomenon, should take place in the midst of other sciences dealing with man and the world."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
