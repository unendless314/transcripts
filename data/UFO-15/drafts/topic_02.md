25. As a political science university student in 1967, I founded Centro Ufologico Nazionale, which is the most authoritative scientific ufo research team and one of the world's five oldest civilian ufo organizations still active in touch with Aeronautica Militare, the Italian Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. Since 1947, Italy experienced more than 12,000 ufo events and four major ufo waves in 1950, 1954, 1973, and 1978.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. And Aeronautica Militare Italiana faced them seriously.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. In the '60s and '70s, I also developed discrete but important personal contacts with Soviet ufologists and I visited them in Moscow in 1974.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. In 1978, Joseph Allen Hynek, the former consultant for the United States Air Force Project Blue Book, asked me to represent his Center for Ufo Studies in Italy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. I was already an Italian correspondent for NYCAP, APRO, and MUFON.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. During the Cold War in 1971 and 1972, I had been an officer in the Italian Army's Nike-Hercules 3rd Missile Brigade.

→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. Back to civilian life after my marriage, I had been also asked to cooperate as a consultant on UFOs by Italian Army intelligence officer Colonel Michelangelo Privitera in Florence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. In 1978, I and CUN began to interact also with the Italian Air Force in Rome due to the amazing Italian UFO wave of that year with over 2,000 UFO sightings report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. Among so many reliable UFO experiences-- pilots, flight controllers, military personnel, journalists, and scientists, as well as common people-- in 1978, I directly witnessed for three hours, and also photographed near Perugia, some as darling-like UFO phenomena interacting with our group of 11 witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. Since then, and as a result of this wave and of a parliamentary question mentioning me and CUN, our center, the Italian Air Force Reparto Generale Sicurezza, was charged by our government's premier, Giulio Andreotti, to monitor UFO phenomena in Italy regularly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. Then in 1980, I was invited by the House of Lords in London to lecture for them about the Italian 1978 UFO wave.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. And I presented several scientific papers in different aerospace congresses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. In particular, a couple of my papers were highly appreciated by the SETI scientists during the International Astronautical Federation Congresses in 1988 and 1999.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. I also investigated directly the Roswell and Philip Corso cases in the United States and also the case for ancient India's Vimana air vehicles in Pakistan.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. In 1993, I started with the government of the Republic of San Marino an annual double world symposium about SETI and UFO research, destined to be the most important event of this kind in Europe during the last 21 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. Besides, in 1994, we translated, released, and published the KGB UFO dossier we received from our Russian colleagues and were officially thanked by our government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. Since 1995, our international UFO magazine started in 1966, began to be distributed and sold in Italian newsstands.

47. And in 1997, a 1,600 page multimedia UFO encyclopedia edited by me was published in Italy and Spain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. Since 1973, I wrote and published 35 books about UFOs and related subjects, also published abroad.

49. In 2012, The Nature of the UFO Problem was even presented in a popular comic book with me as the principal character.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. Apart from this, in 2000, the Italian Air Force sent an official delegation in their uniforms headed by the Reparto Generale Sicurezza's chief, General Aldo Oliveiro, to present their UFO data during the San Marino symposium.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. Later, I was allowed in different occasions to consult their files in Rome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. That is, about 400 military UFO dossier in 40 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. In my books, I publish the synthesis of most of these files, ranging from rather visual sightings and intercepting actions by pilots to photographic evidence and from physical traces cases to UFO landings and close encounters with their occupants.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. Nevertheless, not all cases may be found in these archives, such as the event occurred in the president of Italy's private estate at Castelga-Porziano on August the 20th, 1963, and some other ghost cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. As a good friend of the late Roman Catholic theologian Monsignor Corrado Balducci, who wrote the preface to one of my books, I am well-informed about the Vatican UFO and ET attitudes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. And I also lectured about all this inside the Vatican city, also recently, on the 24th of April of this year.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. In 2000, we exposed in San Marino important historical documents verified by forensic analysis written in 1936 about Italian UFO reports in the '30s, showing that the first government who faced the UFO problem in the world was really the Italian government in 1933 with a secret scientific team created by Mussolini and headed by Guglielmo Marconi to study unconventional flying vehicles as possible new enemy weapons from another country in Europe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. Besides, recent historical studies confirm the visual evidence of the presence of UFOs also in Italian Renaissance paintings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. In my opinion, the intelligent nature of UFO phenomena is evident, and the extraterrestrial hypothesis in ufology is today stronger and stronger.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. To conclude, this year, after the second official philatelic issue of a San Marino stamp about UFOs, delegates from 10 different countries-- Italy, France, USA, Switzerland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Spain, Norway, and Cuba-- proposed to create an international UFO documentation center in San Marino and presented during the symposium a common and definite scientific proposal for future and needed extraterrestrial contact protocols.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. This will be a good basis for a necessary approach to exodiplomacy, the future scenario for human civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. Thank you.
