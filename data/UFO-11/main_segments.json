Martin, who I mention here today just because of his success in recent months."},{"segment_id":203,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When it was over, Don Schmidt talked to me about the Roswell UFO crash and said that the Center for UFO Studies was beginning some research into it."},{"segment_id":204,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He thought my military background might be a benefit because many of the witnesses were retired military, and of course many of the witnesses had been members of the military at the time of the events."},{"segment_id":205,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of the first things I noticed was that Colonel Thomas Dubose had been identified as General Roger Ramey's aide, but brigadier generals don't have a full colonel as an aide."},{"segment_id":206,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Dubose was the chief of staff, a much more important position."},{"segment_id":207,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Dubose would later provide some very interesting testimony about what had been seen and done, including transferring the Roswell debris to SAC headquarters in Washington, D.C. at the time, all documented on videotape."},{"segment_id":208,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We made our first trip to Roswell in February 1989."},{"segment_id":209,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We started in Albuquerque and had a meeting with Frank Joyce, but when we arrived, Joyce begged off saying that he was ill."},{"segment_id":210,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We met with a group of UFO researchers in Albuquerque, but they turned out to be a group of people more interested in the New Age phenomenon and not exactly UFO researchers."},{"segment_id":211,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At any rate, they had nothing of interest for us and they had no insights into the Roswell case."},{"segment_id":212,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We headed to Roswell and met with Cliff Stone."},{"segment_id":213,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He knew a great deal about UFOs, but was unable to shed any insights into the Roswell case other than the crash site was beyond twin windmills."},{"segment_id":214,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We thought this might be a really good clue until we saw how many twin windmills there were in New Mexico."},{"segment_id":215,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Our last interview was with Bill Brazel, son of Mack, who had found the debris."},{"segment_id":216,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I didn't hold out much hope for this, but when we met with him in Carrizoza, New Mexico, he was able to provide us with some very interesting information."},{"segment_id":217,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We chatted for a few minutes and then Brazel said to us, \"My dad found this thing,\" and we were off."},{"segment_id":218,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Bill told us what had happened to his father Mack, how he had been held at the base in Roswell for a number of days, how he'd been asked not to talk about it."},{"segment_id":219,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I suppose you could say he was sworn to secrecy, though there didn't seem to be any threats made to him and no documents signed."},{"segment_id":220,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Mack didn't even tell his son Bill much about what he had seen."},{"segment_id":221,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Bill told us that he was out on the ranch in the next couple of years where the object had crashed, or at least touched down briefly, where his dad had found this debris."},{"segment_id":222,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He would look for some of it."},{"segment_id":223,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He described for us on audio tape three items that he found over the years, a piece of wood-like material that was so tough he couldn't get a sliver on it when he tried to carving on it with his pocket knife, which he said he used to cut barbed wire."},{"segment_id":224,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said it was also that it was very lightweight, it was brown, it seemed to be like balsa wood."},{"segment_id":225,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He found a bit of wire that he said you could shine a light into one end and it would come out the other, which of course is fiber optics."},{"segment_id":226,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he had a piece of foil, the famous foil, that could be crushed into a ball and then unfold itself without a sign of a wrinkle or a crease."},{"segment_id":227,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Bill showed it to his father who said, \"That looks like some of the contraption I found.\""},{"segment_id":228,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At this point we realized that there was more than a misidentified weather balloon as the Air Force had suggested in 1947."},{"segment_id":229,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was clear from the descriptions of the material that Brazel himself had held, which he described for us was not something that had been manufactured on Earth."},{"segment_id":230,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We knew that there was a lot more work to be done."},{"segment_id":231,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I located former major, later retired Colonel, Edwin Easley, who was a provost marshal in the base in 1947."},{"segment_id":232,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The provost marshal is similar to the chief of police in a city, but a provost marshal also has a number of other duties revolving around security."},{"segment_id":233,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Easley, because this was an atomic strike force, had a greater responsibility of officers of a similar grade at other military installations."},{"segment_id":234,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He told me on audio tape several times that he'd been sworn to secrecy."},{"segment_id":235,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Finally, somewhat exasperated with my questions, he said, \"I can't talk about it."},{"segment_id":236,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I promised the president that I wouldn't.\""},{"segment_id":237,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, I don't know if he talked to President Truman personally or a representative of the president, which is about the same thing, but whatever the circumstance, he believed he'd promised the president he wouldn't talk about it."},{"segment_id":238,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Skeptics ask, \"Would the president talk to a major?\""},{"segment_id":239,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I say, \"An obscure lieutenant colonel talked to the president, and the Doolittle raid was born.\""},{"segment_id":240,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Easley confirmed that Brazel had been held on the base for several days."},{"segment_id":241,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said that Brazel was held in the guest house, which is not exactly jail."},{"segment_id":242,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But if you have a guard on the door and you're not allowed to leave, it really doesn't matter how comfortable the quarters are, it still qualifies as a jail."},{"segment_id":243,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I will note that we can prove Brazel was in Roswell after he first reported the find based on the documentation we have."},{"segment_id":244,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Neighbors tell us he complained to them about being held there."},{"segment_id":245,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Marion Strickland, one of the neighbors, said on videotape that Brazel had been gone for several days and he was mad about it."},{"segment_id":246,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So Easley confirmed part of the story for us."},{"segment_id":247,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Easley was also asked by me if the craft was extraterrestrial."},{"segment_id":248,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What happened precisely is that I asked him if we were following the right path."},{"segment_id":249,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said, \"What do you mean?\""},{"segment_id":250,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I said, \"We think it was extraterrestrial,\" and he said, \"Well, that's not the wrong path.\""},{"segment_id":251,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Every member of Colonel Blanchard's staff, Blanchard being the commanding officer at Roswell at the time, and who later was in line to be chief of staff at the Air Force, gave us a variation of that."},{"segment_id":252,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Major Jesse Marcel Sr., an Air Force intelligence officer at the time, said on videotape, \"It seems that it was something that came to Earth, but it was not something made on Earth.\""},{"segment_id":253,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let me say here that the skeptics have attempted to slander the memory of Blanchard by suggesting he was a loose cannon, which explains his handling of the discovery and the press release that he ordered issued."},{"segment_id":254,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But his ratings not long after the Roswell crash by his superior officers, he was rated quite high and there was nothing mentioned about the Roswell case."},{"segment_id":255,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"A loose cannon is not promoted to general and is not destined to be the chief of staff."},{"segment_id":256,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Major Patrick Saunders, the base adjutant, who wouldn't talk much about the Roswell case when I interviewed him, did leave some documentation for us."},{"segment_id":257,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He wrote on the flyleaf to the book, \"UFO Crash at Roswell,\" \"Here's the truth, and I still haven't told anybody anything,\" and he signed it pat."},{"segment_id":258,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This page is called Damage Control, and it tells that files were altered, that they changed personnel records and the code words, and that the bodies and the craft were removed from Roswell."},{"segment_id":259,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In a letter to his daughter, which he kindly sent to me, Saunders talked about how they had successfully hid the paper trail."},{"segment_id":260,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Walter Haut, the man who wrote the press release announcing that they had captured a flying saucer, signed an affidavit about what he had seen, which included craft and bodies."},{"segment_id":261,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Hott said that in his position as PIO, that he often operated as Colonel Blanchard's aide-de-camp, a colonel not being authorized in aid."},{"segment_id":262,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's been some controversy about Hott's statement because for 20 years that I knew him, he had always said that he just wrote the press release."},{"segment_id":263,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He didn't know anything beyond that."},{"segment_id":264,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He didn't see anything beyond that."},{"segment_id":265,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Then in the affidavit signed and released after his death, he said that he had seen the bodies."},{"segment_id":266,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was a direct contradiction of what he had claimed."},{"segment_id":267,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Ten years before that, I interviewed a fellow named Richard Harris."},{"segment_id":268,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was a finance officer at the Roswell Army Airfield, and he helped Patrick Saunders bury the expenditure of money."},{"segment_id":269,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let me digress here for just a moment."},{"segment_id":270,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Everything has to be paid for by the military, or in the military, and all expenditures must be accounted for."},{"segment_id":271,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You can't send an aircraft on a training flight, for example, without naming a funding source for that flight."},{"segment_id":272,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Of course, you can have a cross-country training flight from Roswell to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, a perfectly legitimate expense, and you can always put the records of an alien craft or the bodies on the flight without having to note it."},{"segment_id":273,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The flight is paid for out of the training budget, and there is no need to mention the genesis of the mission, which is to take the stuff to Ohio."},{"segment_id":274,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So Harris confirmed some of what Saunders had said, but more importantly, he told me that he'd seen the bodies, or he had almost seen the bodies."},{"segment_id":275,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"According to Harris, he was in a hangar where the bodies were temporarily located, and Haught asked him if he wanted to see them."},{"segment_id":276,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Harris said that he put his hand on the door knob, but he didn't turn it."},{"segment_id":277,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This stunned me, given the chance I would have opened the door, but that's today in 1947."},{"segment_id":278,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Harris said that he didn't want to see that."},{"segment_id":279,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But it confirms to an extent what Walter Haught said about seeing the bodies, and as I say, Harris told me this 10 years before Walter Haught mentioned anything like that."},{"segment_id":280,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now I have noticed I have just a minute left, and I had some interesting things I wanted to cover, but let me just say this."},{"segment_id":281,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The Air Force claimed this was Project Mogul."},{"segment_id":282,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The documentation suggests it was flight number four, but when we look at the diary created by Dr. Albert Crary, who is the leader of the project, he said flight number four had been canceled."},{"segment_id":283,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was no flight number four."},{"segment_id":284,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There is a note that says that they had made it some kind of a test flight, but it's not part of the official record of the project in New Mexico."},{"segment_id":285,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Mogul, by the way, was not highly classified."},{"segment_id":286,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The equipment was off the shelf."},{"segment_id":287,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What they were doing in New Mexico was published in the newspapers, and worse still, according to the documentation, these flights had to be announced in the FAA notums."},{"segment_id":288,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These notices to airmen were items that could affect aerial navigation."},{"segment_id":289,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"An array of balloons, some 600 feet long, drifting along at tens of thousands of feet fit that definition."},{"segment_id":290,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Moore was aware of that in 1995, wrote that they had not contacted the FAA because they didn't expect this mythical flight number four to leave the restricted area."},{"segment_id":291,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I wanted to mention one final thing, and I see my time has expired."},{"segment_id":292,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But on July 8th, they made the press release."},{"segment_id":293,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"On July 9th, according to the newspapers, the United Press reported, \"Report to flying saucers whizzing through the sky fell off sharply today as the Army and the Navy began a concentrated campaign to stop the rumors.\""},{"segment_id":294,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The question is, what happened to make them stop on July 9th when they had published everything else?"},{"segment_id":295,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I will say this, in 1947, the Air Force said what fell at Roswell was a weather balloon."},{"segment_id":296,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When they made their investigation in the mid-1990s, they said they lied about this."},{"segment_id":297,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It wasn't a weather balloon, it was a weather balloon."},{"segment_id":298,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They just changed the name, it counted a cluster of balloons, it was nothing special about them, they were just weather balloons tethered together in a long train, but it did not answer the question."},{"segment_id":299,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Why did the service members at Roswell fail to identify it as such?"},{"segment_id":300,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Why could they not identify a weather balloon, no matter what name you apply to it?"},{"segment_id":301,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":302,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":303,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And thank you for the brevity of your statements thus far."},{"segment_id":304,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to clear up something, because we've got three Marcells there, and we're talking about your father, who was a major intelligence officer, is that correct?"},{"segment_id":305,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":306,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You're a colonel in the Army, that was a medical doctor in addition to that, and then you've got your son, you would be Marcell number two, he's Marcell number three, okay?"},{"segment_id":307,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And your position at this point, and then we've got Denise, who I presume is your wife?"},{"segment_id":308,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Sister."},{"segment_id":309,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Sister, okay, so we've got the whole family here, and we're going to get testimony from all of you."},{"segment_id":310,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We appreciate that, and so Colonel, please proceed."},{"segment_id":311,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, sir."},{"segment_id":312,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm the son of Major Jesse Marcell, who was the intelligence officer for the 509th Composite Bomb Group based out of Roswell Army Airfield in 1947."},{"segment_id":313,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The 509th, as you may recall, was the squadron who entered the war with the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."},{"segment_id":314,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My dad's credentials obviously were very impressive."},{"segment_id":315,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In the course of his career, he was not only one of the few officers selected for the 509th, but he also went to radar school and also was a staff member of the Air Force intelligence officer."},{"segment_id":316,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The radar school was important because in that he would have been very familiar with all kinds of weather balloons and radar targets and the paraphernalia associated with this kind of a device, you know, weather balloon or mogul balloon, but a balloon is still a balloon with off-the-shelf material."},{"segment_id":317,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I myself followed a career in medicine, graduating from the LSU School of Medicine in 1961, and I joined the military shortly after my graduation and internship."},{"segment_id":318,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My first taste of the military was being stationed aboard the USS Renville, which is a troop transport ship destined for Cuba."},{"segment_id":319,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We spent several weeks sitting around in circles south of Cuba in preparation for the invasion, which fortunately never happened, or else I wouldn't be here."},{"segment_id":320,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah, really."},{"segment_id":321,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I ended my career as an Army colonel in December 2005 after a 13-month tour in Iraq where I gained 200 hours of combat flying and, you know, things like that, just having fun out there really."},{"segment_id":322,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I did not come home entirely unscathed, however, I got severe PTSD from all the rigor, and also I developed a weakness in my legs that they think is related to some sort of toxic contamination that I became exposed to in Iraq, but that's neither here nor there."},{"segment_id":323,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And my story for the Roswell part began in the wee hours in the morning of July 1947, when I was awakened by my dad who was returning from an assignment to collect debris of unknown origin from a ranch out of Roswell."},{"segment_id":324,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is the Foster Ranch and this is the debris that Mack Brazel had run across."},{"segment_id":325,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Apparently the rancher, by the name of Mack Brazel, notified the local sheriff of Chavez County of the downing of some sort of aircraft on his land."},{"segment_id":326,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was not quite sure what the nature of this was."},{"segment_id":327,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He'd seen weather balloons, you know, go down there before, so he was not sure it was that either, but it was something very different."},{"segment_id":328,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The sheriff in Chavez County contacted Colonel Blanchard, who was the commander of the Air Force Base in Roswell."},{"segment_id":329,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now Colonel Blanchard knew my dad was the intelligence officer, so he dispatched my dad and a CIC agent, Sheridan Cavill, to investigate what this was, whether it was one of our planes or just whatever, just an unknown crash site."},{"segment_id":330,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So it was their job to go ahead and ascertain what was out there and bring representative portions of this back to the base so they could study it to determine, make a final determination of this."},{"segment_id":331,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As it turns out, our house happened to be on the way to the base, and this is in the wee hours of the morning."},{"segment_id":332,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So my dad, knowing that he had seen something very special, wanted my mother and myself to look at this also, because as he said, you'll never see this again."},{"segment_id":333,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So what he did, he stopped off at the house, awakened my mother and myself, and again the wee hours of the morning, it was summertime, I'd been playing all day with my bicycles and things like that."},{"segment_id":334,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was 11 years old at the time, however, and he brought us into the kitchen and saw a smattering of this strange debris on the kitchen floor that he had prepositioned."},{"segment_id":335,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said, \"Look at this."},{"segment_id":336,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think this is what you call a flying saucer or remains thereof.\""},{"segment_id":337,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was not quite sure what a flying saucer was at that time, because I was more interested in bicycling and using my 22 rifle for practice."},{"segment_id":338,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But at any rate, the first thing he wanted us to do, or me particularly, was to check the debris out, make sure there was no electronic components there, looking for vacuum tubes, resistors, condensers, and things like that."},{"segment_id":339,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But there wasn't any, and he already knew that, but he wanted me to satisfy my own curiosity as is."},{"segment_id":340,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The debris itself consisted of three components, three types."},{"segment_id":341,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was a foil, a very tough metallic foil of some nature that I can't really describe."},{"segment_id":342,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I had to add that I did not see the bending and unbending of it, but my dad witnessed it."},{"segment_id":343,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said if you folded over, it'd unfold and assume its original form."},{"segment_id":344,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In addition, there was a black plastic debris, like a broken phonograph record."},{"segment_id":345,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the strangest thing I saw as being passed around right now was that this is a replica of one of the I-beams, or the beams I saw in the wreckage."},{"segment_id":346,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In that, you'll note there's some symbols written along the inside surface of this, and they're a purplish-violet hue, semi-reflective of light."},{"segment_id":347,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But this is basically what this was."},{"segment_id":348,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is this a replica?"},{"segment_id":349,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, sir."},{"segment_id":350,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a replica."},{"segment_id":351,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If it was original, I wouldn't have it."},{"segment_id":352,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, you never know, that's why we're asking."},{"segment_id":353,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's right."},{"segment_id":354,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But anyway, my dad drove the debris into the base that night, I think it was that night or maybe early next morning, where he was assigned by Colonel Blanchard to fly the material to General Ramey's office in Fort Worth."},{"segment_id":355,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This was flown in the belly of a B-29 under armed guard."},{"segment_id":356,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I then saw a picture of my dad taken in General Ramey's office, holding what was obviously a radar target."},{"segment_id":357,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They had already switched the debris."},{"segment_id":358,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the look on his face is quite telling, he says, \"You've got to be kidding me."},{"segment_id":359,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is not what I saw, and this is not what I saw either.\""},{"segment_id":360,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But anyway, that's where the cover began, in General Ramey's office."},{"segment_id":361,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So when my dad got home, he sat my mother and myself down and said in no uncertain terms, \"You will never talk about this."},{"segment_id":362,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a non-event.\""},{"segment_id":363,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And yes, sir, I was normally a brat, so I was following orders."},{"segment_id":364,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I never discussed this with my friends or anybody else until after Stan Friedman interviewed my dad in 1978."},{"segment_id":365,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Great."},{"segment_id":366,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":367,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let me reemphasize, as a military officer, you took an oath to the Constitution, not to General Ramey or to anybody else."},{"segment_id":368,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's the Constitution."},{"segment_id":369,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We move now to your son, Jesse, the third."},{"segment_id":370,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The third, yep."},{"segment_id":371,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Marcel."},{"segment_id":372,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Marcel is a French name?"},{"segment_id":373,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Marcel?"},{"segment_id":374,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you to the distinguished members of the committee."},{"segment_id":375,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I am here today not to speak as an expert witness to what I have heard and researched about Roswell, but simply to help you get to know two great men, my grandfather, Major Jesse Marcel Sr., and my father, Dr. Jesse Marcel."},{"segment_id":376,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My grandfather was a simple man who just wanted to lead a simple life."},{"segment_id":377,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Closer to the mic, please."},{"segment_id":378,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Sorry."},{"segment_id":379,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I could restate that."},{"segment_id":380,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My grandfather was a simple man who just wanted to lead a simple life, starting at a very early age when he wasn't helping the family with the farm."},{"segment_id":381,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He would sneak away to find parts to build radios."},{"segment_id":382,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Later in his life, before entering the war, he would use his skills to build a ham radio that would become a lifelong passion."},{"segment_id":383,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He would spend endless hours chatting with people from around the world."},{"segment_id":384,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Things would change rapidly as we were pulled into the Second World War."},{"segment_id":385,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"On his own accord, he went from his job as a civilian draftsman to joining the war effort where he excelled in his duties from the very beginning."},{"segment_id":386,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"His superiors recognized his aptitude towards problem-solving and sent him to an intelligence school."},{"segment_id":387,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Again, he excelled in his courses and was asked to teach the next incoming class."},{"segment_id":388,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He would eventually end up in the Roswell Air Force Base working in our nuclear bombing program with the 509th Composite."},{"segment_id":389,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"With the war over and a life returning to a sense of normalcy, Grandpa would receive a simple order, an order that would change his and most of our lives forever."},{"segment_id":390,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The heavens would open up and send us a visitor that would establish the words \"alien\" and \"flying saucer\" in the English vernacular, and it was him they sent to investigate."},{"segment_id":391,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Decades later, my father followed in Grandpa's footsteps as a military man serving the Navy to train to be a medical doctor."},{"segment_id":392,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Soon after, he would settle down in Clancy, Montana to raise a family and continue in the reserves to become a helicopter pilot."},{"segment_id":393,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As an ENT, I remember as a child going with my father on his rounds, not the ones at the hospital, but the ones where he would visit his parents in their homes."},{"segment_id":394,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He would carry in his little black bag and take care of his patients in the same caring way he would take care of the rest of us."},{"segment_id":395,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Back in the office, if a child showed up in ratty shoes to his appointment, a new pair would be waiting for him on their next visit."},{"segment_id":396,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I remember very fondly watching him not only build a oscilloscope, but his design and construction of a computer guidance system for the oscilloscope long before there was such a thing, at least on an amateur level."},{"segment_id":397,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He would spend endless hours wrapping small green glass switches that would eventually become the brain."},{"segment_id":398,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In the summer, we would all pile into a van, RV or whatever form of transportation that we'd have available to us and head to Houma, Louisiana, where my grandparents had lived or had returned to live out the rest of their lives."},{"segment_id":399,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I remember so clearly driving down a shell-covered road leading out to their house with the most notable feature being a huge greenhouse that easily equaled the size of their residence that my grandfather lovingly built for his wife, Vio."},{"segment_id":400,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My grandmother had a green thumb like no other."},{"segment_id":401,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My father would send her a tomato plant that would barely survive the short Montana summers into immense vegetation that would reach the floor to ceiling."},{"segment_id":402,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Each morning, my grandfather would lead me to his shop, occupying a space in the house in the garage."},{"segment_id":403,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He'd reach up into the rafters and pull down fishing poles that had been there for decades."},{"segment_id":404,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These poles were not made of fiberglass, but of bamboo, very simple, but effective in their trade."},{"segment_id":405,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I recall leaning against a table saw in his workshop, watching him attach the reel with the hand that was missing a digit from some long ago battle with that same table saw."},{"segment_id":406,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He would add the weights and the bobber from two rusty old tackle boxes and finish the session off by showing me how to delicately hook the worm without injuring myself."},{"segment_id":407,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All this was not always the case."},{"segment_id":408,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We'd make our way to the back door and out on his lawn that ran up against a bayou."},{"segment_id":409,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"After a couple of casts, we could sit back and talk and enjoy each other's company."},{"segment_id":410,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My grandfather's other great obsessions were sports."},{"segment_id":411,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"LSU provided the teams that he most favored and occupied his weekend TV viewing hours."},{"segment_id":412,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'll always remember grandpa as a gentle giant who somehow lived the life of a southern gentleman who would be at least partially responsible for change in the way people of our world would look into the night skies, and think to themselves, \"Maybe, just maybe, somebody was looking back.\""},{"segment_id":413,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Today, I share these same stories I learned as a child with my own kids, rousal as a new type of conversation between the kids and their teachers in elementary school."},{"segment_id":414,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The legacy will go on."},{"segment_id":415,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":416,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":417,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And now for your sister."},{"segment_id":418,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, first of all, I also want to thank the committee for taking the time to listen to our family's history."},{"segment_id":419,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My name is Denise Marcel."},{"segment_id":420,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I am the granddaughter of Major Jesse Marcel, Sr., and the daughter of retired Colonel Dr."},{"segment_id":421,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Marcel, Jr."},{"segment_id":422,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My grandfather was the first military officer at a UFO crash site in Roswell, New Mexico."},{"segment_id":423,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"While there, he collected some of the crash site debris."},{"segment_id":424,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was so amazed by the characteristics of the debris, he decided he had to show my father and grandmother."},{"segment_id":425,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And whatever it was that they had seen, it has had a great impact on our family."},{"segment_id":426,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When we moved to Clancy, Montana in the early '70s, my father built a telescope in our backyard."},{"segment_id":427,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, this wasn't one of your average, ordinary telescopes."},{"segment_id":428,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"To start, he dug a hole in our backyard the size of a small room."},{"segment_id":429,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For months, I remember my mother and us kids helping him polish this very large mirror."},{"segment_id":430,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"From there, he began constructing the telescope, including building a rotating dome."},{"segment_id":431,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This was a telescope that was later loaned to the Helena Astronomy Association."},{"segment_id":432,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he had built this from top to bottom."},{"segment_id":433,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My dad was a man who had witnessed something."},{"segment_id":434,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This was a man who was driven."},{"segment_id":435,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That telescope opened up a whole new world for our family."},{"segment_id":436,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was around the age of nine that I first became aware of UFOs, not only because of the telescope, but also because there were times my father and us kids would camp out at night specifically looking for movement in the skies hoping to catch a glimpse of a UFO."},{"segment_id":437,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One has to remember, we didn't have the Internet then, and UFOs were not discussed like they are today."},{"segment_id":438,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I do not think that my parents would lead us to believe at such a young age that UFOs existed if my father and grandfather had not witnessed something extraordinary."},{"segment_id":439,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In January of 1997, I accompanied my father and Kent Jeffreys to Washington, D.C. for a hypnosis session that Dr. Neil Hibbler would conduct over the course of three days."},{"segment_id":440,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Dr. Hibbler was one of the world's leading experts who used hypnotic regressions for forensic purposes."},{"segment_id":441,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I had been very fortunate to be able to participate because I had just been certified as a hypnotherapist."},{"segment_id":442,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The sessions were successful."},{"segment_id":443,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"While under hypnosis, my father said he couldn't believe how vividly he could see his dad."},{"segment_id":444,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I saw the emotion in his face and how it touched his heart seeing his father so clearly that day."},{"segment_id":445,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"During the sessions, my father recalls being woken up by my grandfather telling him to come and look at a piece of a flying saucer, a term in which most people, including himself, was not familiar with."},{"segment_id":446,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When asked about the materials, my father's descriptions did not waver from what he had been describing throughout the years."},{"segment_id":447,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of the more interesting facets of the debris descriptions are the symbols or hieroglyphics that my father had seen on the eye beam."},{"segment_id":448,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"While under hypnosis, the facts remain the same."},{"segment_id":449,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Just like when he was a child, he motioned grabbing the eye beam and holding it above his head to get a better look at the purple reflecting symbols."},{"segment_id":450,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The military claimed that these symbols were merely Christmas-wrapped tape, but it is very unlikely and does not seem possible that three people did not recognize simple holiday decorations on some Scotch tape."},{"segment_id":451,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Another interesting fact my father recalled was that soon after the incident, his father told the family never to talk about it again, that it was a non-event."},{"segment_id":452,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now why would they have to remain silent about a weather or a Mogul balloon doesn't make any sense to me."},{"segment_id":453,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It has been said that since my father did not remember anything new from those sessions and did not remember seeing any exotic debris, electronic components or anything that resembled motors which they were specifically looking for, this material could not have been from a UFO, that the material was just too mundane."},{"segment_id":454,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I believe this argument works against itself because if it had been some radar device there should have been some very basic electronic components and it would have been mundane."},{"segment_id":455,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Therefore my grandfather would never have brought it home to show his family."},{"segment_id":456,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The only explanation that he brought this home was because he was very excited about what he had found."},{"segment_id":457,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My grandfather and father were very dedicated military men and always followed through with their orders."},{"segment_id":458,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They both remained silent to the public about the incident until my grandfather had been approached by Stanton Friedman nearly 30 years after the event."},{"segment_id":459,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"During interviews my grandfather was asked about the materials and he would say, \"It was not anything from this earth that I am quite sure of.\""},{"segment_id":460,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These words would change the course of the Marcel family."},{"segment_id":461,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The reason he was ordered to go to the site was because he was an intelligence officer familiar with most all of the materials used in aircraft and travel."},{"segment_id":462,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was very qualified to make an assessment of the crash site debris."},{"segment_id":463,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And for the record, my grandfather had nothing to gain when he spoke to Stanton Friedman."},{"segment_id":464,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He just felt the same way that I do, that the world should know the truth."},{"segment_id":465,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It has affected my family's life in so many good ways and some bad, but because of this I was also given the greatest gift of all and that is to have an open mind."},{"segment_id":466,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I feel that sometimes agendas are put in front of our rights of being citizens and not everything that the government has told us is the truth."},{"segment_id":467,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because when it comes to the Roswell incident, I believe my grandfather and my father."},{"segment_id":468,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Last and certainly not least, it is my hope that for my father, my grandfather and all of the other wonderful people who have found the courage to step up and tell the truth this week will be given the respect and recognition that they deserve."},{"segment_id":469,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":470,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I just want to say that the Marcel family has a very close friend and his name is Richard O'Connor."},{"segment_id":471,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't know if you've seen what he's put forward to support you."},{"segment_id":472,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So he's a friend of yours."},{"segment_id":473,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to now turn to, for the members' sake, we have seven minutes that we can delve into with these people."},{"segment_id":474,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I'll first turn to Merrill Cook to start the process."},{"segment_id":475,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, that's right."},{"segment_id":476,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you, Mr. Chair."},{"segment_id":477,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Donald Schmidt, I'd like to start with you."},{"segment_id":478,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You said that you went down to New Mexico with an idea of doing something in the fiction area."},{"segment_id":479,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You weren't really much of a believer."},{"segment_id":480,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No."},{"segment_id":481,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No."},{"segment_id":482,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But it changed your mind."},{"segment_id":483,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That was Kevin Randall and myself, correct."},{"segment_id":484,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And what changed your mind is you said you met with first-hand witnesses."},{"segment_id":485,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Correct."},{"segment_id":486,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'd like to know what year that was."},{"segment_id":487,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That was February of 1989."},{"segment_id":488,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":489,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And could you tell me who those first-hand witnesses you met with?"},{"segment_id":490,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Dr. Randall had mentioned specifically it was the son of W.W. Mack Brazzo, Bill Brazzo Jr., and we could also add his wife, Shirley, who were both first-hand witnesses to the material."},{"segment_id":491,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So you talked to them on that occasion."},{"segment_id":492,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We had the opportunity at that time and many times thereafter, including other members of the Brazzo family."},{"segment_id":493,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What we could also point out is that Bill Jr., the son of the rancher, was fortunate enough to discover additional remnants from the crash."},{"segment_id":494,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Months thereafter, especially after heavy rains, pieces washed the surface."},{"segment_id":495,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now bear in mind, we already had first-hand accounts that there were 50 to 60 troops at the debris field site for the course of two and a half to three days walking shoulder to shoulder with wheelbarrows, going to check sites."},{"segment_id":496,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It required that much time to clear this site in contrast to a weather balloon, which would have taken all of them a few minutes for someone to toss over their shoulder, toss into the back of a pickup truck."},{"segment_id":497,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I have almost no doubt that something crashed there, that there was a lot of pickup, and I just wonder exactly who it was you."},{"segment_id":498,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You talked to me."},{"segment_id":499,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You've answered that very well."},{"segment_id":500,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've got a lot of witnesses here that really want an opportunity to talk to up."},{"segment_id":501,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Lieutenant Colonel Randall, you had talked about work you've done to show why Air Force Project Blue Book was, you used some rather negative language about it, and why it was just, a cover-up is what you said?"},{"segment_id":502,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What happened in, all during the 1960s, there is a series of letters you see in the Project Blue Book files where they're requesting to get Project Blue Book out of A-Tech into the Secretary of the Air Force's Office of Information to de-emphasize the importance of Project Blue Book."},{"segment_id":503,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, now de-emphasizing the importance of Project Blue Book, that's not exactly the same thing, and that's, when I look at, I'm not trying to put any words in your mouth, but I've got to focus in on a question here, and that's when the University of Colorado was asked to help him make a decision about Project Blue Book, let's put it that way, and when the University of Colorado wrote a report, I think you're all correct in saying that what the report said wasn't exactly the way it was characterized even by the, certainly by the government, and even by, well, and by the media as well, but isn't it true that it didn't say anything about it all being nonsense, it just said we don't want to fund additional work on collection, collecting this data, that we are publishing to the world, I mean, there are 101 incidents published that we can read about from Project Blue Book,"},{"segment_id":504,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"am I correct?"},{"segment_id":505,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What I'm asking is, you have absolutely no faith, and that's fine, in the National Science Foundation, is that what you're telling us?"},{"segment_id":506,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What I'm saying is that the outcome of the scientific investigation was preordained."},{"segment_id":507,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's a letter from Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla to committee members at the Condon Committee at the University of Colorado saying, this is what we want you to find."},{"segment_id":508,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They haven't investigated a case, they haven't looked at anything, but here's what we want you to find."},{"segment_id":509,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You have to say something nice about the Air Force investigation, you have to say that it does not affect national security, and allow us to close it down, because if you don't do that, we're going to be stuck with this for another 20 years."},{"segment_id":510,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So the University of Colorado pulled the wool over the National Science Foundation, folks, is that what you're telling us?"},{"segment_id":511,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":512,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"During the investigation."},{"segment_id":513,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They couldn't figure out that maybe there was influence from the Air Force on what Colorado was?"},{"segment_id":514,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They didn't care."},{"segment_id":515,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The whole purpose of the Condon Committee was to end Project Blue Book and stop the Air Force investigation."},{"segment_id":516,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"During the Condon Committee's time in session, they were supposed to investigate cases that came up."},{"segment_id":517,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was a marvelous case from Shag Harbor, Canada, where something was photographed in the air, it was seen to hit the ground."},{"segment_id":518,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The United States Navy responded, the Canadian military forces responded, and there's even evidence that the Russians responded."},{"segment_id":519,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The Condon Committee's investigation was to make a phone call to Canada and say, oh, it's just a couple of teenagers who saw something strange, we're not going to bother with it."},{"segment_id":520,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I appreciate your answer, I'm going to move on, not because I don't want you to have more opportunity, but I'm so particularly interested in what Colonel Marcel, Dr. Colonel, and boy, you should be proud of these children and grandchildren of Jenny, Jesse Senior."},{"segment_id":521,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You have done a wonderful job in establishing, you know, just that story about the fishing pole."},{"segment_id":522,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And you're talking about an honest grandfather, I mean, you didn't have to even use that word, the way you described that, and to you too, Denise."},{"segment_id":523,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I'm very impressed with you, Jesse Marcel Jr., I mean, you're one of the very few witnesses that have actually held or seen or accompanied your father with something in your hand that came from this incident or an incident that, let me put it this way, somebody that's a friend of mine, somebody that I've listened to, somebody I already said I had respect for, a different party, but former Governor Bill Richardson has said to me and others with us in a discussion we had with him that everything you have said is honest."},{"segment_id":524,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's no question in his mind that that debris is there, it happened, and what you've said about your father and doing all that is absolutely true."},{"segment_id":525,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What you've said to me here directly simply reinforces something I believe because I have a lot of faith in the integrity of the man I just mentioned, Bill Richardson."},{"segment_id":526,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I have to say this, I'm looking at you straight in the eyes here."},{"segment_id":527,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I know that you believe that's from an extraterrestrial source, but can you say honestly to this committee that you know that for some reason or that there's something that you absolutely know that the government is hiding because Bill Richardson agrees with you that they should open the files, I agree with you, they should open those Roswell files."},{"segment_id":528,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We should see exactly what might remain from whatever you and your father took over."},{"segment_id":529,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So yeah, you give this committee a lot of reasons for us to say open those files."},{"segment_id":530,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I just want to hear an answer to the question I gave you."},{"segment_id":531,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Years ago I was called to Washington, I was going to a meeting, and there was a gentleman by the name of Dick D'Amato who wanted to interview me when I got to Washington."},{"segment_id":532,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he was in the Capitol building, Senate room 228 I believe if I remember right."},{"segment_id":533,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But he said he wanted to talk to me about what I saw in Roswell."},{"segment_id":534,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I went up to the Capitol building, and very friendly, very nice gentleman."},{"segment_id":535,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He says, you know, we want to talk about what you saw in Roswell."},{"segment_id":536,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he asked me, did I want to talk in a secure room?"},{"segment_id":537,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I said, well, sir, I'm not going to say anything I haven't said publicly already."},{"segment_id":538,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He says, but I might tell you something."},{"segment_id":539,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so we'll talk in a secure room."},{"segment_id":540,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So we went down into the basements, several floors down below in the Capitol building, and there was this beautiful meeting room there with a big table there with the pictures of our founding fathers across the overhead there."},{"segment_id":541,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And when we sat down, he sat at the head of the table, I sat to his right."},{"segment_id":542,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He had a legal pad to take notes on."},{"segment_id":543,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And there was a book on the table too, it was called Majestic."},{"segment_id":544,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was a book by Whitley Strieber, which actually is a fictional account of an established fact there."},{"segment_id":545,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he said, this is not fiction."},{"segment_id":546,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So he admitted to me right there, this is not fiction."},{"segment_id":547,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a story about the Roswell, you know, anti-fictionalized version."},{"segment_id":548,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so as a conclusion, you came to after you had a chance to listen to some people that had analyzed some of that material, am I correct in that?"},{"segment_id":549,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":550,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I'm not necessarily saying you may have been right or wrong on that."},{"segment_id":551,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm just wanting to know how you arrived at your decision that you believe it is from non-terrestrial sources or extra-terrestrial sources."},{"segment_id":552,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, you know, this is the first time somebody in the, you know, in the inner sanctums of our government admitted to me that this is not fiction, the Roswell."},{"segment_id":553,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I said, I know it isn't."},{"segment_id":554,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So when are you guys going to tell the public about this?"},{"segment_id":555,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he said, well, you know, if it was up to me, you ought to have done it yesterday."},{"segment_id":556,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But he says, it is not up to me."},{"segment_id":557,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm just here to investigate the cost of the investigates cost of keeping a secret and all that."},{"segment_id":558,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said, in reality, there is, and these are his words, that there is a black government, which sounds really conspiratorial, but that's what he said."},{"segment_id":559,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He said, they have control of the debris and they answer to no one, they're not elected and have unlimited funds to spend."},{"segment_id":560,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he said, they're the ones who have it and they have control over it."},{"segment_id":561,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So you can tell me what that meant."},{"segment_id":562,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But that's what he said."},{"segment_id":563,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I obviously don't know, but thank you very much."},{"segment_id":564,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, sir."},{"segment_id":565,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":566,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"To all of you for testifying, you did a great job."},{"segment_id":567,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"How long, I mean, I look at what happened at Roswell as a, something that happened a long time ago and that there was some put down of it and there's been some fun made out of it."},{"segment_id":568,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But that a lot of people, because there were enough information, enough facts out that a lot of people believed that something happened there."},{"segment_id":569,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is that, am I way off base?"},{"segment_id":570,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, I'm just trying to think back a few years because it hasn't been in the paper recently, you know, but that's my recollection of that incident, that there was enough proof that we knew it was something other than from the United States."},{"segment_id":571,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah, Donald?"},{"segment_id":572,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As I'd mentioned in my opening statement, I'd like to emphasize that we had the good fortune of working with and having enlisted the late Congressman Steven Schiff of New Mexico who pushed for congressional hearings on this very matter through the early 90s."},{"segment_id":573,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And so much so that he had sent three separate letters to then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, which all went unanswered, which only intrigued him and raised his curiosity all the more as far as, well, what are they hiding?"},{"segment_id":574,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm just asking, as the late Senator Barry Goldwater and even his request to General Curtis LeMay, can I at least see the file to which LeMay said, \"Hell, no, and don't ever ask me again.\""},{"segment_id":575,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So we're in good company, whether we're talking about Goldwater or Schiff or even former Presidents Bill Clinton or Carter, who also would lament the fact that they could not get the truth about Roswell."},{"segment_id":576,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But getting back to Congressman Schiff, in his failed efforts, as the press itself became more interested as to who would win this tug of war, because he was being stonewalled not only by the Secretary of Defense, but also the White House, and then the branches of the military."},{"segment_id":577,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he had assurances, specifically from the Air Force, that should they find anything in their files, he would be the first one."},{"segment_id":578,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, as Newsweek magazine very aptly put it, as though a preemptive strike, they called a press conference here at the Pentagon, and Colonel Richard Weaver, as Colonel Randall mentioned, in putting out the Project Mogul theory, same balloon, it was just a redesign of the same balloon explanation."},{"segment_id":579,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now I'll never forget how I called up Congressman Schiff here in his office in Washington, thinking that, well, that would end that relationship, because he would have to accept that new explanation, that new solution to the Roswell mystery."},{"segment_id":580,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And his immediate words, immediate response to me was, \"Don, they're a bunch of damn liars.\""},{"segment_id":581,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he had assured us, and you know the history, he assured us that with his re-election coming up, that we would then resume the effort."},{"segment_id":582,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, he would die shortly after his re-election, age of 51."},{"segment_id":583,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't read anything into that except that we lost a tremendous ally."},{"segment_id":584,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And in that, there was a lot of that publicity, the fact that someone within the government was actually sticking their nose under the curtain, under the tent, for nothing more than asking to see the files, and still being turned down, still being told just as Senator Goldwater, \"Hell no, and don't ask.\""},{"segment_id":585,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was debris, it crashed, there was debris, and talked about touching the debris, and that it was not something that you'd ever felt or done before."},{"segment_id":586,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is that still around, the debris from that?"},{"segment_id":587,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Not with us, it isn't."},{"segment_id":588,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's the problem."},{"segment_id":589,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't have the debris."},{"segment_id":590,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't have pieces."},{"segment_id":591,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What happened to it?"},{"segment_id":592,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It probably got sent to Wright Field when we know that it got sent."},{"segment_id":593,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Where it went from there, whether it went to Area 51, or who knows what, we don't know."},{"segment_id":594,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The security curtain slammed down very quickly."},{"segment_id":595,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"How quickly afterwards?"},{"segment_id":596,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Five hours."},{"segment_id":597,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"How many?"},{"segment_id":598,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Five hours."},{"segment_id":599,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"From the actual announcement of the recovery of the flying disc, it evolved, as I mentioned, within five hours into the weather balloon."},{"segment_id":600,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In fact, as Stanton mentioned, and we have Brigadier General Thomas DeBose, who is even in two of the pictures with the substituted weather balloon."},{"segment_id":601,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He stated that the balloon was a hoax, that part of it."},{"segment_id":602,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They were ordered, as he described, to get the press off of General Ramey's back."},{"segment_id":603,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They were the ones who substituted the balloon for the real material."},{"segment_id":604,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When you have a Brigadier General going on the record, actually stating that the official government explanation is a hoax, you would think it would get the media's attention."},{"segment_id":605,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's also the dilemma that we have had with the very conception of the investigation of the Roswell incident, the fact that, well, why don't the witnesses come forward?"},{"segment_id":606,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because just as Jesse's father, just imagine, at that time, he was a lieutenant colonel."},{"segment_id":607,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was the head of intelligence of the 509th Bomb Group."},{"segment_id":608,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Again, I can't use the word enough, the elite within the military, head of intelligence."},{"segment_id":609,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We might even ask, why would the base commander, Colonel Blanchard, instead of just sending out a couple of grunts, a couple of enlisted men to go check out this funny material, he sends out his two head of intelligence, two officers, follow the rancher back and investigate this firsthand on a Fourth of July weekend, no less."},{"segment_id":610,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"See, these are all the questions that the press refuses to look into, but we haven't."},{"segment_id":611,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That dilemma, that as Major Marcel, when he finally stepped forward and said, being familiar with all materials, both familiar and domestic, this was something not made on this earth."},{"segment_id":612,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We didn't read about this in the papers, did we?"},{"segment_id":613,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It wasn't on the CBS Evening News."},{"segment_id":614,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The only publication to touch that was the National Enquirer."},{"segment_id":615,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So we wonder why there's this constant taboo, this ridicule factor, and it's the very reason that witnesses have refused to come forward after all these years because they know how it's going to be treated."},{"segment_id":616,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":617,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":618,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm going to ask Colonel Randall."},{"segment_id":619,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What is the significance of the July 1947 Roswell incident in that we also had a significant one in July of 1945?"},{"segment_id":620,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Tell me."},{"segment_id":621,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What is the significance?"},{"segment_id":622,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, the events in Roswell in 1947 set up the entire cover-up."},{"segment_id":623,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At that point ... Cover-up of what?"},{"segment_id":624,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Cover-up of the alien visitation."},{"segment_id":625,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What we look at is, after the Kenneth Arnold signing on June 24, 1947, there was an awful lot of stories in the newspapers about flying saucers."},{"segment_id":626,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was all kinds of discussion about what they were."},{"segment_id":627,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One scientist postulated that if you left a dark movie theater and you walked out into the bright sunlight, you'd see spots in front of your eyes."},{"segment_id":628,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is what people were seeing."},{"segment_id":629,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Didn't explain why the spots were black instead of silver."},{"segment_id":630,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There were military officers making comments."},{"segment_id":631,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At one point, one officer said, \"Well, we're not interested in the flying saucers anymore.\""},{"segment_id":632,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, stop."},{"segment_id":633,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't want to know the editorial."},{"segment_id":634,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to know what, about the Roswell incident, began the cover-up."},{"segment_id":635,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You just said it."},{"segment_id":636,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, don't give me the editorial pile."},{"segment_id":637,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Just stay on that part."},{"segment_id":638,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Stay on the scientific part right there."},{"segment_id":639,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What happened at Roswell, the cover-up of the alien, whatever we think that is."},{"segment_id":640,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I hate that word, or whatever that is."},{"segment_id":641,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Why, even yet today, why?"},{"segment_id":642,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In 1947, we'd just come out of a war."},{"segment_id":643,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We are worried about our competitors in the world."},{"segment_id":644,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If we can exploit this find, discover the propulsion system, discover the materials, how they work, we take a huge step ahead of our competitors and the rest of the world."},{"segment_id":645,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In 1947, it makes perfect sense."},{"segment_id":646,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't want people talking about this."},{"segment_id":647,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The Russians aren't going to spy on us if they don't think there's anything there to spy on, so they've eliminated our competitors."},{"segment_id":648,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Why it persists today, I am somewhat puzzled about, because it would seem that we've become much more sophisticated, and we would understand what's going on in the world around us and space around us."},{"segment_id":649,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Unless we still don't understand."},{"segment_id":650,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think the problem is we haven't decoded the materials."},{"segment_id":651,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":652,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you, sir."},{"segment_id":653,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That was good."},{"segment_id":654,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now you guys who know these people, you don't get to be a major in any of our militaries unless you're a well-respected, highly decorated individual about our nation, our family, and who we are, and that with your father, sir."},{"segment_id":655,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Congratulations on that."},{"segment_id":656,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As 11 years old, if you testify today, you witnessed the Roswell Incident's crash."},{"segment_id":657,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm saying crash."},{"segment_id":658,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You might've called it something else."},{"segment_id":659,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Crash is good, okay."},{"segment_id":660,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You witnessed particles from the crash, balloon notwithstanding, whatever else they said not withstanding, actually saw particles of what the craft may or may not have been."},{"segment_id":661,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Did you not?"},{"segment_id":662,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, ma'am."},{"segment_id":663,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Decorated father, you're now a Colonel, a medical doctor, and the Roswell Incident continues to be mysterious to some, factual to many."},{"segment_id":664,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You had firsthand information and now your children who have lived with a grandfather and a father they've respected of high decorated ability and consequence and served in our military."},{"segment_id":665,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Military has a special emphasis in most countries and certainly in ours."},{"segment_id":666,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's why everybody who testified in these three days to me, who's ever military, have the highest respect for this service and dedication."},{"segment_id":667,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What would you offer to this committee at this time on this issue, Roswell, that would help me to understand and the rest of us as well?"},{"segment_id":668,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Where we go from here, what you've seen, you've already kind of gave us a sample of it and all of that."},{"segment_id":669,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What else should we know before we get up from here today?"},{"segment_id":670,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I think what it does, it tells us that we are not alone in the universe."},{"segment_id":671,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As a matter of fact, there's other civilizations out there and they're finding Earth-like planets around other store systems every day."},{"segment_id":672,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That means that we are probably just beginners, new kids on the block, so to speak."},{"segment_id":673,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They are obviously more advanced than we are in their science and hopefully their cultural abilities too, that they can get here from wherever they come from."},{"segment_id":674,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It also means that they survive their nuclear destructive abilities too."},{"segment_id":675,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think any civilization that develops into the space travel has gone through a nuclear age and we're still on the precipice of either surviving or not surviving ours, but it means they did."},{"segment_id":676,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If they can do it, we can also survive our nuclear war-like tendencies."},{"segment_id":677,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My last final point for me, are you aware through your father or own experiences that we chase their aircraft or we have an occasion and obviously they have traced ours?"},{"segment_id":678,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Does that exist and if so, why and did we find anything?"},{"segment_id":679,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Did they catch us or are we gone or what?"},{"segment_id":680,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I just know what I'm reading in the papers."},{"segment_id":681,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, that's okay."},{"segment_id":682,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Don't speculate."},{"segment_id":683,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm just an observer of one event there and I have a lot of theories, but— I bet."},{"segment_id":684,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'll talk to you offline on those."},{"segment_id":685,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":686,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":687,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":688,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I yield back."},{"segment_id":689,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":690,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":691,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I yield back to Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey."},{"segment_id":692,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":693,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's just so much and it's—you just—you, Marcells, I mean, don't you all worry that this isn't going to be resolved in your lifetime?"},{"segment_id":694,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, good grief, tick, tick, tick."},{"segment_id":695,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Here we are."},{"segment_id":696,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, what—you know, gray hair and gray hair and— I'm 76."},{"segment_id":697,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Some pretty old people, the three of us, but I mean, then your story, then what happens to your story?"},{"segment_id":698,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, it's—and your story, the truth, but it's so much more meaningful when it comes from you."},{"segment_id":699,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, as a 76-year-old, you know, I'm no spring chicken, but, you know, I like to tell my story."},{"segment_id":700,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't want to embellish it, not tell exactly what I knew about this, and if people want to believe this, that's okay."},{"segment_id":701,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If they don't want to believe it, that's also okay."},{"segment_id":702,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's their opinion."},{"segment_id":703,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would certainly like to have the government spill the beans about this while I'm still alive to say, \"I told you so,\" but, I mean, I'd be—but it doesn't matter."},{"segment_id":704,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've been there and done that, so I know what it was."},{"segment_id":705,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":706,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"All of you experts, how many actual ETs have been—I'm going to start saying that instead of the big long word—have been involved in starting with the Roswell and the two years before."},{"segment_id":707,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Wasn't there an actual person—not person—living being, living something as part of that crash before you said that somebody was offered to go in and see, you know, the remains of something?"},{"segment_id":708,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The story was, Walter Haught, as the public information officer, had issued the press release saying that he had retrieved a crash-flying saucer."},{"segment_id":709,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In the years that followed, he just said, \"All I did was write the press release.\""},{"segment_id":710,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":711,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Upon his, Don Schmidt and Tom Carey put together, working with Walter Haught and his family, put together an affidavit to be released after he passed away, giving much more information, and he talked about having actually seen the bodies of the aliens and more about that."},{"segment_id":712,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The important thing was this Richard Harris, who was a financial officer at Roswell in 1947, told me long before Walter admitted to that, that Walter had taken—or seen him in a hangar and said, \"If you want to see something really incredible, it's beyond that door,\" and Harris didn't want to go in there and see the bodies, but it was the body of the alien craft."},{"segment_id":713,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The other part of the question is, did one survive the crash?"},{"segment_id":714,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There has been testimony from a number of witnesses, yes, that one survived the craft and was in captivity."},{"segment_id":715,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I hesitate to use that word because it really wasn't in captivity, but it was held for a number of years."},{"segment_id":716,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Can you think of anything that would be more lonely than that?"},{"segment_id":717,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You're an alien creature on a planet."},{"segment_id":718,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You have absolutely no possibility of getting home."},{"segment_id":719,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You're dealing with a bunch of sentient beings that do not understand you, your culture, or your language, and you're stuck on this planet without any hope of rescue."},{"segment_id":720,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It sounds like a Steven Spielberg movie."},{"segment_id":721,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the point is, there is some testimony that suggests that one may have survived for a period of time."},{"segment_id":722,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I believe the date of its supposed death was in 1952."},{"segment_id":723,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, since then, okay, since then?"},{"segment_id":724,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One of the things beyond first-hand witnesses to the materials, to the wreckage, to the characteristics that even by today's standards defy conventional explanation have been, sadly, but also much to the credit, again, of the witnesses in maintaining that sacred oath to the Constitution, that so many of them, to their very deathbeds, before they would finally confide to their spouses, to their children, and invariably, they all talk about the little people, the little men."},{"segment_id":725,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They all describe either having been out at the site and having witnessed the bodies, or they were posted at the hangar, P3, Building 84, at the Roswell Army Airfield, where they were on guard, and they would observe the wooden crates being assembled and the bodies being placed into these boxes before being shipped out."},{"segment_id":726,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Shipped out to where?"},{"segment_id":727,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, we have the documentation, again, and we have the eyewitness testimony right field in Dayton, Ohio."},{"segment_id":728,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have the late Brigadier General Arthur Exon, who was with Foreign Technology Division, which did the testing, the reverse engineering of captured weaponry and armory from World War II."},{"segment_id":729,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So it made perfect sense that you had something crash of either foreign or something beyond that design."},{"segment_id":730,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It would go to foreign technology."},{"segment_id":731,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And Exon described, not firsthand, but that he was aware of the fact that when the materials from Roswell arrived, when they came in, it was the first impression, because no one was able to recognize this wreckage, that it most likely was Soviet."},{"segment_id":732,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But after it was tested, he described that there was a unanimous consensus that the materials had to be from space."},{"segment_id":733,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So any of that recently?"},{"segment_id":734,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, that was quite a while ago."},{"segment_id":735,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've conducted to date three archaeological digs at the debris field site, the very site that had this huge debris field that canvassed an area of almost three quarters of a mile long, hundreds of feet wide."},{"segment_id":736,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Where is it?"},{"segment_id":737,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is just outside of Corona, New Mexico."},{"segment_id":738,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's about 65 miles northwest of Roswell."},{"segment_id":739,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is where the rancher first reported the find and then led the two intelligence officers, Major Marcel and the head of counterintelligence, Captain Sheridan Cavitt."},{"segment_id":740,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":741,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":742,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":743,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":744,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you, Congressman."},{"segment_id":745,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Did your father, Colonel, mention seeing bodies?"},{"segment_id":746,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Actually, the closest that came to it, my wife asked me one day, \"Did you see the bodies?\""},{"segment_id":747,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And he said, \"No, I did not see them myself, but I knew people who did.\""},{"segment_id":748,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But what?"},{"segment_id":749,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He knew people who did see the bodies, but he did not see them himself."},{"segment_id":750,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":751,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I need a blanket statement right there."},{"segment_id":752,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My wife is the one who asked me, finally came out and asked me."},{"segment_id":753,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Who were the people that saw the bodies?"},{"segment_id":754,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He did not elaborate, so I'm not sure who he was."},{"segment_id":755,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But to answer the question, no, he did not see the bodies."},{"segment_id":756,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":757,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm trying to understand the sequence of events, what happened here."},{"segment_id":758,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You mentioned, Mr. Smith, that they sent two officers there when ordinarily they would have sent some lower level people to investigate."},{"segment_id":759,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What was unusual, when they simply got the word from the rancher that something had crashed, why would they think that was unusual enough to send officers?"},{"segment_id":760,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That is the question."},{"segment_id":761,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":762,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What is it?"},{"segment_id":763,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And again, especially on a Fourth of July weekend, that it would have been brought to the attention."},{"segment_id":764,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, keep in mind, the rancher did not go to the military."},{"segment_id":765,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He reported this to the sheriff, Sheriff George Wilcox of Chavez County, headquartered in Roswell."},{"segment_id":766,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it was only due to the fact that it was a reporter by the name of Frank Joyce from radio station KGFL, who suggested, \"This sounds like a military matter."},{"segment_id":767,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You should report this to the 509th.\""},{"segment_id":768,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And they, in turn, the sheriff contacts the base, personally speaks to Major Marcel, who was at the PX having a sandwich."},{"segment_id":769,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it's important enough, again, Fourth of July weekend, that he alerts the very base commander, Colonel William Blanchard."},{"segment_id":770,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And after examining the material, if it was nothing more mundane than a weather balloon, or even an aircraft, a rocket, an errant rocket."},{"segment_id":771,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We were testing German V-2 rockets over at White Sands at that time."},{"segment_id":772,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was still unusual enough that he would dispatch the two head of intelligence."},{"segment_id":773,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we believe the reason he also sent the head of counterintelligence, Plainclothes, Captain Sheridan Cavitt, was in the event it was something foreign, that he would be the most capable of identifying it if it was something foreign."},{"segment_id":774,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Did the rancher go to the site before the military?"},{"segment_id":775,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":776,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was the one who first discovered the briefing."},{"segment_id":777,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But we don't know specifically what the rancher reported."},{"segment_id":778,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He must have reported something somewhat unusual for them to send two officers rather than two enlisted men."},{"segment_id":779,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He brought some of the wreckage with him."},{"segment_id":780,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":781,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, okay."},{"segment_id":782,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He drove into the sheriff's office, the sheriff calls the base, Major Marcel goes and checks it out, and as he told me, there wasn't anything conventional there."},{"segment_id":783,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the rancher also stressed that there's a huge amount of this stuff out at the ranch."},{"segment_id":784,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":785,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Three-quarters of a mile, a few hundred yards wide, that's a lot of stuff."},{"segment_id":786,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And what he was worried about was that his sheep wouldn't cross the debris field."},{"segment_id":787,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is desert country out there, they need to go where the water is."},{"segment_id":788,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They also don't want sheep eating anything like pieces of foil."},{"segment_id":789,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It is a concern."},{"segment_id":790,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So that was his concern also, and we haven't mentioned it."},{"segment_id":791,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There was an article in the local paper that rewards were being offered for pieces of one of these saucers people were seeing all over the place."},{"segment_id":792,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And when the rancher went to Corona and talked to his buddies there at Corona, that's where they did shopping and stuff like that, this is out in the middle of nowhere, they told him about the reward."},{"segment_id":793,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You had to go try to collect the reward."},{"segment_id":794,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And we have stories, and I don't know how we can confirm them, that the rancher suddenly wound up with some money after all this."},{"segment_id":795,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He certainly was entitled to the reward, and the military said, \"No way, Jose.\""},{"segment_id":796,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Was he also sworn to secrecy?"},{"segment_id":797,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Do we know that, the rancher?"},{"segment_id":798,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Two years later when his son, Bill Jr., had recovered enough pieces to fill up a cigar box, and his wife Shirley even described how he'd come home for dinner after working the ranch and he kept this one piece in his leather chaps, and she would describe how he would take this piece out, and she'd watch as he'd try to whittle on it and poke through it, and then he would crumble it up, crease it, fold it, and every time you'd lay it down it would just smooth right out."},{"segment_id":799,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Two years later, there's a knock on his door, and there was a military captain and three non-commissioned officers."},{"segment_id":800,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We know what you have, and you will give it to us."},{"segment_id":801,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So he turned over the box, this was two years after the incident."},{"segment_id":802,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They mentioned to him, according to Bill Jr., that just as your father swore that he would not say another word about this, and should he ever discover any more material, he would contact us immediately."},{"segment_id":803,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're asking the same of you."},{"segment_id":804,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We should mention one other thing here that I think gives an idea of the scope of the concern by the military here."},{"segment_id":805,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have heard testimony from the daughter of the sheriff, that she was staying with her grandmother, it was the granddaughter, grandmother, it was a show on television about UFOs, and the grandmother says to the granddaughter, \"You know, the reason your grandfather didn't rerun for sheriff was when that saucer crashed, the military came to him and said, 'If you ever tell about what you saw, we will kill you and we will kill your family.'\""},{"segment_id":806,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"She was horrified."},{"segment_id":807,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"\"You didn't believe them,\" she says to her grandmother."},{"segment_id":808,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"\"I was there, I believed them,\" was the answer."},{"segment_id":809,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So sure, it's a little story, but we've heard it."},{"segment_id":810,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The granddaughter was a teacher, they were, how shall I put this, threatening."},{"segment_id":811,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Could the gentleman from Maryland yield just 30 seconds to clear up one question that's, and anybody that can answer this, can anybody here give us the name of any person that would have been at least the age of 18 or older in 1947 who at the time, in a similar way to how Jesse Marcel Sr. said he had received these kinds of materials and they had these certain property trades, which he said almost immediately to people."},{"segment_id":812,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is there anybody other than, or even the child, or who, can you give us the name of anybody who said they saw a body, they saw bodies back in 1947 in the name of any person that you've got in, you know, you've written, or you've studied this?"},{"segment_id":813,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We should mention that."},{"segment_id":814,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We talked about, you know, and I know that Mr. Marcel said that he knew people that had seen the bodies, but he never said he had seen a body."},{"segment_id":815,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I just want to make sure that we have a witness if we do or if we don't."},{"segment_id":816,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I just want to know that could give the kind of credibility on the question of bodies, which was talked about rather freely a few minutes ago, in the same vein, who has seen a body and said so back in 1947, '48, that's my question."},{"segment_id":817,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you're looking for documentation from 1947, we simply don't have it."},{"segment_id":818,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you want the name of somebody who was there in 1947 who saw bodies, then we have lots of names."},{"segment_id":819,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Even Easley, the provost marshal, mentioned to his family that he had seen the bodies."},{"segment_id":820,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He mentioned that they quizzed him about it when he was very gravely ill with cancer, about that, and he said, \"Oh, the creatures to them.\""},{"segment_id":821,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Of course, I asked who had seen the bodies and said so in the same time period."},{"segment_id":822,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Nobody was asking those questions in 1947."},{"segment_id":823,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah, but nobody was asking about debris either until Mr. Marcel said, \"I've seen this debris.\""},{"segment_id":824,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Precisely."},{"segment_id":825,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have- Are you saying that nobody said anything about bodies back in 1947?"},{"segment_id":826,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was only until way later?"},{"segment_id":827,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I just want to know."},{"segment_id":828,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, I'm not questioning- That's probably an accurate statement."},{"segment_id":829,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't know."},{"segment_id":830,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm a little confused on the issue is what I'm- What you have to understand is after the story broke in the newspapers, the military got everybody out of town."},{"segment_id":831,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Marcel is not ... If you're a reporter and you're looking for Major Marcel, you can't find him."},{"segment_id":832,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If you want to talk to Mac Brazel, you can't find him."},{"segment_id":833,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If I could just recline my question, just so I make sure I'm clear here, what I'm trying to ask."},{"segment_id":834,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Hey, the Army, the Air Force, they could have been covering up from day ... less than day one."},{"segment_id":835,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They could from the first second."},{"segment_id":836,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's not what I'm asking about."},{"segment_id":837,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm asking was there any person at the time, and maybe they can't because of a cover-up even at the time."},{"segment_id":838,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm just saying, is there the name of anybody, living or dead, who in 1947, it was documented, they said, and at that time, said, not on their deathbed, not later after they had some other situation, but at the time, said they saw a body."},{"segment_id":839,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's my question."},{"segment_id":840,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I understand the question."},{"segment_id":841,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I understand the question, and the answer is no."},{"segment_id":842,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We have no documentation from that timeframe when they saw the bodies."},{"segment_id":843,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What we have are the people who were there, who later on talked about it."},{"segment_id":844,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Most of these people- I understand what you're saying. ... didn't come forward with their tails."},{"segment_id":845,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That was the- But I wasn't trying to- That's the last time you'll yield to the gentleman from Utah."},{"segment_id":846,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let me- Let me make just one closing observation."},{"segment_id":847,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Oh, one quick question."},{"segment_id":848,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Were there any radar tracks from FAA over this?"},{"segment_id":849,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No?"},{"segment_id":850,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No radar tracks that you know of?"},{"segment_id":851,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No."},{"segment_id":852,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, none."},{"segment_id":853,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":854,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Curious about that."},{"segment_id":855,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Curious about this, that tell me if I didn't know anything else and never met any of you, that the Air Force is not being honest."},{"segment_id":856,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One is, if this was indeed a balloon, there was no darned reason to send it to right field."},{"segment_id":857,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Everybody would have recognized the balloon, so the very fact that they sent the material there tells me that they're not telling the truth."},{"segment_id":858,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The second thing that tells me they're not telling the truth is that if in fact it was a balloon, why in the heck would it issue a press release saying that a flying saucer had crashed there?"},{"segment_id":859,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't know how you can argue away those two things."},{"segment_id":860,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The debunker would say that's because Colonel Blanchard was a loose cannon, and he probably got banned to Siberia for putting out that stupid story."},{"segment_id":861,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've had somebody tell me that."},{"segment_id":862,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They don't mention he got four more promotions."},{"segment_id":863,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was a four-star general when he died of a heart attack, and was Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force."},{"segment_id":864,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's not what you do when you have a loose cannon."},{"segment_id":865,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Those two things alone tell the honest observer that they are not now telling us the truth."},{"segment_id":866,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"A balloon is not going to be sent to Wright-Patterson, and a balloon is not going to result in a press release that says that a flying saucer has crashed."},{"segment_id":867,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That was the press release."},{"segment_id":868,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's what they did with what they found there, and what they found there as far as we know is either still in Wright-Patterson or has been destroyed, right?"},{"segment_id":869,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Or it's been moved to another location."},{"segment_id":870,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Or, yeah, it's still in their possession."},{"segment_id":871,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It can be tracked to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base with documentation."},{"segment_id":872,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Wright Field then, I think."},{"segment_id":873,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Wright Field at the time, yes."},{"segment_id":874,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"From that point on, we don't know where it went."},{"segment_id":875,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It could have gone to Area 51."},{"segment_id":876,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've been told that one of the bodies went to MacDill,

site?"},{"segment_id":884,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What was especially interesting to us was after Major Marcel was sent directly, and as Kevin had mentioned, how they took all the key players immediately out of the picture, that anybody who had information on this was immediately either sent away or went on leave or in the case of Colonel Blanchard, he set up an operation at the crash site."},{"segment_id":885,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They were unavailable to the press, and yet there was still a lot of rumor throughout the area."},{"segment_id":886,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In fact, in talking to surviving people throughout the Roswell area, there was a lot of talk about the bodies, a lot of rumor about bodies recovered, a lot of talk about the little men recovered north of town."},{"segment_id":887,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As far as the counterintelligence officer, when Major Marcel was sent for the balloon press conference in Fort Worth with General Ramey, he was kept overnight, and then when he returned late afternoon the next day, July 9th, on the very flight that we're convinced

your mother to come in and, \"Let's take a look at this.\""},{"segment_id":928,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Exactly."},{"segment_id":929,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He pre-positioned it."},{"segment_id":930,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":931,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Pre-positioning, he was trying to form somewhat of a design, if you're pre-positioning."},{"segment_id":932,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I think he was trying to put it together, you know, but there's so much of it, you couldn't do that."},{"segment_id":933,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There wasn't enough."},{"segment_id":934,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":935,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And was a beam like this, which you're circling, is this one of the things you saw there on the floor?"},{"segment_id":936,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":937,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There are several beams like that."},{"segment_id":938,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And like I said, there was also some black plastic debris, like a broken phonograph record at that time, but it wasn't that, it wasn't vinyl."},{"segment_id":939,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the debris primarily was the beams, the foil, and the black plastic debris."},{"segment_id":940,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I did not, again, see any electronics."},{"segment_id":941,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As your father is talking to you and your mother, did he mention any fact that, \"Boy, we saw this debris and look at it, but we also saw some bodies\"?"},{"segment_id":942,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Did he say anything like that?"},{"segment_id":943,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, sir."},{"segment_id":944,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So he made, he did not want to horrify you as a child or your mother that he saw something worse than that."},{"segment_id":945,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So do you have any conclusion from the conversation as an 11-year-old that maybe your dad was not telling you everything that he saw?"},{"segment_id":946,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The bodies were at another location."},{"segment_id":947,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It wasn't all in one place."},{"segment_id":948,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The debris was over here, the crew compartment, call it what you want, was someplace else."},{"segment_id":949,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Very good."},{"segment_id":950,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's a good addition."},{"segment_id":951,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I want to stay with the 11-year-old boy."},{"segment_id":952,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":953,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The question was, I'm sorry."},{"segment_id":954,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Oh, well."},{"segment_id":955,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Did you have any inkling as an 11-year-old that your father was withholding horrific information from you as he's displaying the physical findings?"},{"segment_id":956,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He kind of kept things close to his chest."},{"segment_id":957,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I'm not sure what the internal thoughts were on this, but he was very adamant that we were not to talk about it."},{"segment_id":958,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That we were going to what?"},{"segment_id":959,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That we were not to talk about this."},{"segment_id":960,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But he kept things close to his chest."},{"segment_id":961,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He had a job on the base, and I really never knew what he did because he was an intelligence, he didn't really confide with the family what his job was or what he did, things like that."},{"segment_id":962,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Which would be the normal task of a father who's an intelligence."},{"segment_id":963,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is there anything else you can share with us of your impressions and knowledge of an 11-year-old boy?"},{"segment_id":964,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, it was a very Earth awakening experience or space awakening experience for me."},{"segment_id":965,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It did make this very, did make me very interested in astronomy and cosmology because I realized that whatever was on the kitchen floor didn't come from here, but came from out there."},{"segment_id":966,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I got that impression from other comments that you've made that you've intellectualized your experience quite extensively."},{"segment_id":967,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let me close this facet for another hearing."},{"segment_id":968,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're going to take a segment."},{"segment_id":969,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Carolyn has a question."},{"segment_id":970,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Carolyn, please."},{"segment_id":971,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I heard you were about to close it, and I just wanted to ask."},{"segment_id":972,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I just wanted to ask something you just said."},{"segment_id":973,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The major was an intelligence high-level man."},{"segment_id":974,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, ma'am."},{"segment_id":975,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Kept things close to his chest."},{"segment_id":976,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, ma'am."},{"segment_id":977,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Didn't share a lot with you that he felt was very high intellectually, has to do with his work."},{"segment_id":978,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":979,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But he prearranged what he had gotten that night and put it away on the floor, woke you up and your mom to come take a look at it."},{"segment_id":980,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, that in and of itself, this goes my mystery side of me, but then that was significant."},{"segment_id":981,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He wanted you to talk about it."},{"segment_id":982,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He never talked to you about it, but he wanted you to see that and never to mention it again."},{"segment_id":983,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What do you make of that?"},{"segment_id":984,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, later."},{"segment_id":985,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Sorry?"},{"segment_id":986,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's a time period in between when he saw it on the floor and when it came back from Texas."},{"segment_id":987,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, I'm talking about just the floor and just waking you up, seeing you."},{"segment_id":988,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He didn't have to show anything."},{"segment_id":989,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He could have just took it onto the base and did whatever he did."},{"segment_id":990,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I should bring that up."},{"segment_id":991,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He thought it was significant material."},{"segment_id":992,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right, and he wanted his child to see it and his wife who he never even discussed things with."},{"segment_id":993,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At that time, the material was not classified, so he felt okay to do that."},{"segment_id":994,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As a matter of fact, the only time I knew my dad to break security clearances is when he came back from overseas, I asked him what did the atomic bomb look like?"},{"segment_id":995,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What he did, he drew the outline of the Fat Man bomb that was used on Nagasaki, but then he tore it up and threw it away in the trash can."},{"segment_id":996,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I wasn't suggesting that he was breaking any kind of intelligence by showing it."},{"segment_id":997,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He thought it ... He's a major."},{"segment_id":998,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He's a big time."},{"segment_id":999,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He's up there with the generals and almost with the joint chief of staff, you know?"},{"segment_id":1000,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He wanted to show you what he had found and what had obviously crashed near your home, but you couldn't say something about it."},{"segment_id":1001,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Then, for whomever they are to take it and make a light of it and it never happened and it's a balloon, that doesn't go together."},{"segment_id":1002,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No."},{"segment_id":1003,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Again, he was very excited about this."},{"segment_id":1004,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a very special event there."},{"segment_id":1005,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He wanted my mother and myself to be first-hand witnesses to this thing, but when he came back from Fort Worth after General Ramey, then he said, \"No more.\""},{"segment_id":1006,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It didn't happen."},{"segment_id":1007,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Period."},{"segment_id":1008,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":1009,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":1010,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":1011,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're going to take a 10-minute stretch recess."},{"segment_id":1012,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No more than that, 10 minutes, and we'll go into the next testimony."}]
