303. And thank you for the brevity of your statements thus far.
→ {"text": "感謝各位目前為止簡潔的陳述。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. I want to clear up something, because we've got three Marcells there, and we're talking about your father, who was a major intelligence officer, is that correct?
→ {"text": "我想先釐清一件事，因為這裡有三位 Marcel，我們在討論的是您的父親，他是一位少校情報官，對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. You're a colonel in the Army, that was a medical doctor in addition to that, and then you've got your son, you would be Marcell number two, he's Marcell number three, okay?
→ {"text": "您是陸軍中校，同時也是一位醫生，然後這是您的兒子，您是第二代 Marcel，他是第三代 Marcel，對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. And your position at this point, and then we've got Denise, who I presume is your wife?
→ {"text": "還有您目前的職位，然後我們這裡還有 Denise，我猜是您的妻子？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，長官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. I'm the son of Major Jesse Marcell, who was the intelligence officer for the 509th Composite Bomb Group based out of Roswell Army Airfield in 1947.
→ {"text": "我是 Jesse Marcel 少校的兒子，他是 1947 年駐紮於羅斯威爾陸軍航空基地的 509 混合轟炸大隊情報官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. The 509th, as you may recall, was the squadron who entered the war with the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
→ {"text": "各位可能還記得，509 大隊是執行廣島和長崎原子彈轟炸任務而結束戰爭的中隊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. My dad's credentials obviously were very impressive.
→ {"text": "我父親的資歷顯然非常出色。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. In the course of his career, he was not only one of the few officers selected for the 509th, but he also went to radar school and also was a staff member of the Air Force intelligence officer.
→ {"text": "在他的職業生涯中，他不僅是少數獲選加入 509 大隊的軍官之一，還曾接受雷達學校訓練，並擔任空軍情報官的幕僚成員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. The radar school was important because in that he would have been very familiar with all kinds of weather balloons and radar targets and the paraphernalia associated with this kind of a device, you know, weather balloon or mogul balloon, but a balloon is still a balloon with off-the-shelf material.
→ {"text": "雷達學校訓練很重要，因為他會非常熟悉各種氣象氣球、雷達目標以及與這類裝置相關的所有器材，無論是氣象氣球或莫古爾氣球，但氣球終究是氣球，都是現成的材料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

317. I myself followed a career in medicine, graduating from the LSU School of Medicine in 1961, and I joined the military shortly after my graduation and internship.
→ {"text": "我本人則從事醫學生涯，於 1961 年畢業於 LSU 醫學院，畢業和完成實習後不久便加入軍隊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

318. My first taste of the military was being stationed aboard the USS Renville, which is a troop transport ship destined for Cuba.
→ {"text": "我初次體驗軍旅生涯是被派駐在 USS Renville 號上，那是一艘開往古巴的部隊運輸艦。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

319. We spent several weeks sitting around in circles south of Cuba in preparation for the invasion, which fortunately never happened, or else I wouldn't be here.
→ {"text": "我們在古巴南方海域繞圈待了好幾個星期，準備進行入侵行動，幸運的是入侵從未發生，否則我今天就不會在這裡了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

320. Yeah, really.
→ {"text": "確實如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. And I ended my career as an Army colonel in December 2005 after a 13-month tour in Iraq where I gained 200 hours of combat flying and, you know, things like that, just having fun out there really.
→ {"text": "我於 2005 年 12 月以陸軍中校身份結束職業生涯，在伊拉克服役 13 個月期間累積了 200 小時的戰鬥飛行時數，諸如此類的經歷，真的很充實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. I did not come home entirely unscathed, however, I got severe PTSD from all the rigor, and also I developed a weakness in my legs that they think is related to some sort of toxic contamination that I became exposed to in Iraq, but that's neither here nor there.
→ {"text": "然而，我並非毫髮無傷地回國，我因為種種艱苦而患上嚴重的創傷後壓力症候群，腿部也出現無力症狀，他們認為可能與我在伊拉克接觸到的某種有毒污染物有關，但這些都不是重點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. And my story for the Roswell part began in the wee hours in the morning of July 1947, when I was awakened by my dad who was returning from an assignment to collect debris of unknown origin from a ranch out of Roswell.
→ {"text": "我關於羅斯威爾事件的故事始於 1947 年 7 月的凌晨時分，當時我被父親叫醒，他剛從羅斯威爾郊外的一座牧場執行任務歸來，收集了來源不明的殘骸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. This is the Foster Ranch and this is the debris that Mack Brazel had run across.
→ {"text": "這就是 Foster 牧場，這些就是麥克·布拉澤爾所發現的殘骸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. Apparently the rancher, by the name of Mack Brazel, notified the local sheriff of Chavez County of the downing of some sort of aircraft on his land.
→ {"text": "顯然這位名叫麥克·布拉澤爾的牧場主人向 Chavez 郡當地警長報告，有某種飛行器墜毀在他的土地上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. He was not quite sure what the nature of this was.
→ {"text": "他不太確定這是什麼性質的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. He'd seen weather balloons, you know, go down there before, so he was not sure it was that either, but it was something very different.
→ {"text": "他以前在那裡見過墜落的氣象氣球，所以他也不確定是不是氣象氣球，但這是非常不同的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. The sheriff in Chavez County contacted Colonel Blanchard, who was the commander of the Air Force Base in Roswell.
→ {"text": "Chavez 郡的警長聯繫了布蘭查德上校，他是羅斯威爾空軍基地的指揮官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. Now Colonel Blanchard knew my dad was the intelligence officer, so he dispatched my dad and a CIC agent, Sheridan Cavill, to investigate what this was, whether it was one of our planes or just whatever, just an unknown crash site.
→ {"text": "布蘭查德上校知道我父親是情報官，所以他派遣我父親和一名反情報部隊幹員 Sheridan Cavitt 前往調查這是什麼，是否是我們的飛機或其他什麼東西，總之是一個不明墜毀現場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. So it was their job to go ahead and ascertain what was out there and bring representative portions of this back to the base so they could study it to determine, make a final determination of this.
→ {"text": "所以他們的任務是前往現場確認那裡有什麼，並將代表性的部分帶回基地，以便研究並做出最終判斷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. As it turns out, our house happened to be on the way to the base, and this is in the wee hours of the morning.
→ {"text": "結果我們家剛好在回基地的路上，而且這是在凌晨時分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. So my dad, knowing that he had seen something very special, wanted my mother and myself to look at this also, because as he said, you'll never see this again.
→ {"text": "所以我父親知道他看到了非常特別的東西，也想讓我母親和我看看，因為正如他所說：「你們再也不會看到這種東西了。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. So what he did, he stopped off at the house, awakened my mother and myself, and again the wee hours of the morning, it was summertime, I'd been playing all day with my bicycles and things like that.
→ {"text": "所以他在家裡停了下來，叫醒了我母親和我，再次強調這是凌晨時分，當時是夏天，我整天都在玩自行車之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. I was 11 years old at the time, however, and he brought us into the kitchen and saw a smattering of this strange debris on the kitchen floor that he had prepositioned.
→ {"text": "當時我 11 歲，他帶我們進廚房，在廚房地板上看到他預先擺放的一些奇怪殘骸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. He said, "Look at this.
→ {"text": "他說：「看看這個。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. I think this is what you call a flying saucer or remains thereof."
→ {"text": "「我想這就是你們所說的飛碟或其殘骸。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. I was not quite sure what a flying saucer was at that time, because I was more interested in bicycling and using my 22 rifle for practice.
→ {"text": "當時我不太確定飛碟是什麼，因為我更感興趣的是騎自行車和用我的 22 口徑步槍練習射擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. But at any rate, the first thing he wanted us to do, or me particularly, was to check the debris out, make sure there was no electronic components there, looking for vacuum tubes, resistors, condensers, and things like that.
→ {"text": "但無論如何，他要我們做的第一件事，特別是要我做的，就是檢查殘骸，確認那裡沒有電子元件，尋找真空管、電阻器、電容器之類的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. But there wasn't any, and he already knew that, but he wanted me to satisfy my own curiosity as is.
→ {"text": "但什麼也沒有，他其實早就知道了，但他想讓我親自滿足自己的好奇心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

340. The debris itself consisted of three components, three types.
→ {"text": "殘骸本身由三種成分、三種類型組成。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. There was a foil, a very tough metallic foil of some nature that I can't really describe.
→ {"text": "有一種箔片，一種非常堅韌的金屬箔片，我實在無法描述它的性質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. I had to add that I did not see the bending and unbending of it, but my dad witnessed it.
→ {"text": "我必須補充說明，我沒有看到它彎曲和回彈的過程，但我父親親眼目睹了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. He said if you folded over, it'd unfold and assume its original form.
→ {"text": "他說如果你把它折起來，它會自動展開並恢復原來的形狀。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. In addition, there was a black plastic debris, like a broken phonograph record.
→ {"text": "此外，還有一種黑色塑膠殘骸，像破碎的唱片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. But the strangest thing I saw as being passed around right now was that this is a replica of one of the I-beams, or the beams I saw in the wreckage.
→ {"text": "但我看到最奇怪的東西，正在現場傳閱的這個，是我在殘骸中看到的其中一根 I 型樑的複製品。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. In that, you'll note there's some symbols written along the inside surface of this, and they're a purplish-violet hue, semi-reflective of light.
→ {"text": "你們會注意到在這個內側表面上寫著一些符號，它們呈現紫羅蘭色，有半反光的效果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. But this is basically what this was.
→ {"text": "但基本上就是這個樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. Is this a replica?
→ {"text": "這是複製品嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，長官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. This is a replica.
→ {"text": "這是複製品。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. If it was original, I wouldn't have it.
→ {"text": "如果是原件，我就不會有了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

352. Well, you never know, that's why we're asking.
→ {"text": "嗯，誰知道呢，所以我們才問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. That's right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. But anyway, my dad drove the debris into the base that night, I think it was that night or maybe early next morning, where he was assigned by Colonel Blanchard to fly the material to General Ramey's office in Fort Worth.
→ {"text": "但無論如何，我父親當晚將殘骸運回基地，我想是當晚或隔天清晨，布蘭查德上校指派他將材料空運到 Fort Worth 的雷米將軍辦公室。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. This was flown in the belly of a B-29 under armed guard.
→ {"text": "這些材料被放在 B-29 轟炸機的腹部，由武裝警衛看守運送。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. So I then saw a picture of my dad taken in General Ramey's office, holding what was obviously a radar target.
→ {"text": "然後我看到一張我父親在雷米將軍辦公室拍的照片，他手上拿著的明顯是雷達目標。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. They had already switched the debris.
→ {"text": "他們已經掉包了殘骸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. And the look on his face is quite telling, he says, "You've got to be kidding me.
→ {"text": "他臉上的表情很能說明問題，他的表情彷彿在說：「你們一定是在開玩笑吧。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

359. This is not what I saw, and this is not what I saw either."
→ {"text": "「這不是我看到的東西，這也不是我看到的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. But anyway, that's where the cover began, in General Ramey's office.
→ {"text": "但無論如何，真相掩蓋就是從雷米將軍的辦公室開始的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. So when my dad got home, he sat my mother and myself down and said in no uncertain terms, "You will never talk about this.
→ {"text": "所以當我父親回到家時，他讓我母親和我坐下，用非常明確的語氣說：「你們絕對不能談論這件事。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. This is a non-event."
→ {"text": "「這件事從未發生過。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. And yes, sir, I was normally a brat, so I was following orders.
→ {"text": "是的，長官，我通常是個調皮的孩子，但這次我遵守了命令。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

364. So I never discussed this with my friends or anybody else until after Stan Friedman interviewed my dad in 1978.
→ {"text": "所以我從未與朋友或任何人討論過這件事，直到 1978 年史丹·佛烈德曼訪問我父親之後。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. Great.
→ {"text": "很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. Let me reemphasize, as a military officer, you took an oath to the Constitution, not to General Ramey or to anybody else.
→ {"text": "讓我再次強調，作為一名軍官，您宣誓效忠的是憲法，而不是雷米將軍或任何其他人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. It's the Constitution.
→ {"text": "是憲法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. We move now to your son, Jesse, the third.

424. He was so amazed by the characteristics of the debris, he decided he had to show my father and grandmother.
→ {"text": "他對殘骸的特性感到如此驚訝，決定一定要讓我父親和祖母看看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. And whatever it was that they had seen, it has had a great impact on our family.
→ {"text": "無論他們看到的是什麼，對我們家族產生了巨大的影響。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. When we moved to Clancy, Montana in the early '70s, my father built a telescope in our backyard.
→ {"text": "70 年代初期我們搬到蒙大拿州 Clancy 時，我父親在我們的後院建造了一座望遠鏡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. Now, this wasn't one of your average, ordinary telescopes.
→ {"text": "這可不是一般普通的望遠鏡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. To start, he dug a hole in our backyard the size of a small room.

435. That telescope opened up a whole new world for our family.
→ {"text": "那座望遠鏡為我們家族打開了一個全新的世界。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. It was around the age of nine that I first became aware of UFOs, not only because of the telescope, but also because there were times my father and us kids would camp out at night specifically looking for movement in the skies hoping to catch a glimpse of a UFO.
→ {"text": "大約九歲的時候，我第一次意識到不明飛行物的存在，不僅是因為望遠鏡，還因為有時我父親和我們這些孩子會在晚上露營，專門尋找天空中的移動物體，希望能瞥見不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. One has to remember, we didn't have the Internet then, and UFOs were not discussed like they are today.
→ {"text": "必須記住，當時我們沒有網際網路，不明飛行物也不像今天這樣被討論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. I do not think that my parents would lead us to believe at such a young age that UFOs existed if my father and grandfather had not witnessed something extraordinary.
→ {"text": "我不認為我的父母會在我們這麼小的年紀就讓我們相信不明飛行物的存在，除非我父親和祖父真的目睹了某些非凡的事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. I had been very fortunate to be able to participate because I had just been certified as a hypnotherapist.

442. The sessions were successful.
→ {"text": "治療過程很成功。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. While under hypnosis, my father said he couldn't believe how vividly he could see his dad.
→ {"text": "在催眠狀態下，我父親說他無法相信自己能如此清晰地看到他的父親。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. I saw the emotion in his face and how it touched his heart seeing his father so clearly that day.
→ {"text": "我看到他臉上的情緒，那天如此清晰地看到父親是如何觸動他的心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. During the sessions, my father recalls being woken up by my grandfather telling him to come and look at a piece of a flying saucer, a term in which most people, including himself, was not familiar with.
→ {"text": "在治療過程中，我父親回憶起被祖父叫醒，要他來看一塊飛碟的碎片，這個詞大多數人包括他自己都不熟悉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "當被問及材料時，我父親的描述與他多年來一直描述的沒有任何差異。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. One of the more interesting facets of the debris descriptions are the symbols or hieroglyphics that my father had seen on the eye beam.
→ {"text": "殘骸描述中較有趣的一個面向是我父親在 I 型樑上看到的符號或象形文字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. While under hypnosis, the facts remain the same.
→ {"text": "在催眠狀態下，事實保持不變。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. Just like when he was a child, he motioned grabbing the eye beam and holding it above his head to get a better look at the purple reflecting symbols.
→ {"text": "就像他小時候一樣，他做出抓住 I 型樑並舉過頭頂的動作，以便更清楚地看到那些反射紫光的符號。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. The military claimed that these symbols were merely Christmas-wrapped tape, but it is very unlikely and does not seem possible that three people did not recognize simple holiday decorations on some Scotch tape.
→ {"text": "軍方聲稱這些符號只是聖誕包裝膠帶，但三個人都認不出膠帶上簡單的節日裝飾圖案，這非常不可能也不合理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. Another interesting fact my father recalled was that soon after the incident, his father told the family never to talk about it again, that it was a non-event.
→ {"text": "我父親回憶起的另一個有趣事實是，事件發生後不久，他的父親告訴家人永遠不要再談論此事，這是一個從未發生的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. Now why would they have to remain silent about a weather or a Mogul balloon doesn't make any sense to me.
→ {"text": "為什麼他們必須對一個氣象氣球或莫古爾氣球保持沉默，這對我來說毫無道理。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. It has been said that since my father did not remember anything new from those sessions and did not remember seeing any exotic debris, electronic components or anything that resembled motors which they were specifically looking for, this material could not have been from a UFO, that the material was just too mundane.
→ {"text": "有人說，既然我父親在那些治療過程中沒有回憶起任何新東西，也沒有記得看到任何奇異殘骸、電子元件或任何類似馬達的東西（這些正是他們特別在尋找的），這些材料不可能來自不明飛行物，這些材料太過平凡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. I believe this argument works against itself because if it had been some radar device there should have been some very basic electronic components and it would have been mundane.
→ {"text": "我認為這個論點自相矛盾，因為如果那是某種雷達裝置，應該會有一些非常基本的電子元件，而且會很平凡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. Therefore my grandfather would never have brought it home to show his family.
→ {"text": "因此我祖父絕不會把它帶回家給家人看。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. The only explanation that he brought this home was because he was very excited about what he had found.

→ {"text": "他們兩人對公眾保持沉默，直到事件發生近 30 年後，我祖父被 Stanton Friedman 找上門。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. During interviews my grandfather was asked about the materials and he would say, "It was not anything from this earth that I am quite sure of."
→ {"text": "在訪談中，當被問及那些材料時，我祖父會說：「我非常確定那不是來自地球的任何東西。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. These words would change the course of the Marcel family.
→ {"text": "這些話改變了 Marcel 家族的命運。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. The reason he was ordered to go to the site was because he was an intelligence officer familiar with most all of the materials used in aircraft and travel.
→ {"text": "他被命令前往現場的原因是，他是一名情報官，熟悉飛機和交通工具所使用的幾乎所有材料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. He was very qualified to make an assessment of the crash site debris.
→ {"text": "他非常有資格評估墜毀現場的殘骸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. And for the record, my grandfather had nothing to gain when he spoke to Stanton Friedman.

464. He just felt the same way that I do, that the world should know the truth.
→ {"text": "他的感受和我一樣，認為世界應該知道真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. It has affected my family's life in so many good ways and some bad, but because of this I was also given the greatest gift of all and that is to have an open mind.
→ {"text": "這以許多好的方式和一些壞的方式影響了我家人的生活，但也因此我獲得了最偉大的禮物，那就是擁有開放的心胸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. I feel that sometimes agendas are put in front of our rights of being citizens and not everything that the government has told us is the truth.
→ {"text": "我認為有時某些議程被置於我們作為公民的權利之前，政府告訴我們的並非一切都是真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. Because when it comes to the Roswell incident, I believe my grandfather and my father.
→ {"text": "因為當涉及羅斯威爾事件時，我相信我的祖父和父親。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. Last and certainly not least, it is my hope that for my father, my grandfather and all of the other wonderful people who have found the courage to step up and tell the truth this week will be given the respect and recognition that they deserve.
→ {"text": "最後但同樣重要的是，我希望我的父親、祖父以及所有在本週鼓起勇氣站出來說出真相的優秀人們，能夠獲得他們應得的尊重和認可。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
