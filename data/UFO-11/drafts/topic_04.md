## Speaker Group 1

303. And thank you for the brevity of your statements thus far.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. I want to clear up something, because we've got three Marcells there, and we're talking about your father, who was a major intelligence officer, is that correct?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. You're a colonel in the Army, that was a medical doctor in addition to that, and then you've got your son, you would be Marcell number two, he's Marcell number three, okay?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. And your position at this point, and then we've got Denise, who I presume is your wife?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. Sister.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. Sister, okay, so we've got the whole family here, and we're going to get testimony from all of you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. We appreciate that, and so Colonel, please proceed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. I'm the son of Major Jesse Marcell, who was the intelligence officer for the 509th Composite Bomb Group based out of Roswell Army Airfield in 1947.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. The 509th, as you may recall, was the squadron who entered the war with the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. My dad's credentials obviously were very impressive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. In the course of his career, he was not only one of the few officers selected for the 509th, but he also went to radar school and also was a staff member of the Air Force intelligence officer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. The radar school was important because in that he would have been very familiar with all kinds of weather balloons and radar targets and the paraphernalia associated with this kind of a device, you know, weather balloon or mogul balloon, but a balloon is still a balloon with off-the-shelf material.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. I myself followed a career in medicine, graduating from the LSU School of Medicine in 1961, and I joined the military shortly after my graduation and internship.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. My first taste of the military was being stationed aboard the USS Renville, which is a troop transport ship destined for Cuba.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. We spent several weeks sitting around in circles south of Cuba in preparation for the invasion, which fortunately never happened, or else I wouldn't be here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. Yeah, really.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. And I ended my career as an Army colonel in December 2005 after a 13-month tour in Iraq where I gained 200 hours of combat flying and, you know, things like that, just having fun out there really.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. I did not come home entirely unscathed, however, I got severe PTSD from all the rigor, and also I developed a weakness in my legs that they think is related to some sort of toxic contamination that I became exposed to in Iraq, but that's neither here nor there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. And my story for the Roswell part began in the wee hours in the morning of July 1947, when I was awakened by my dad who was returning from an assignment to collect debris of unknown origin from a ranch out of Roswell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. This is the Foster Ranch and this is the debris that Mack Brazel had run across.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. Apparently the rancher, by the name of Mack Brazel, notified the local sheriff of Chavez County of the downing of some sort of aircraft on his land.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. He was not quite sure what the nature of this was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. He'd seen weather balloons, you know, go down there before, so he was not sure it was that either, but it was something very different.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. The sheriff in Chavez County contacted Colonel Blanchard, who was the commander of the Air Force Base in Roswell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. Now Colonel Blanchard knew my dad was the intelligence officer, so he dispatched my dad and a CIC agent, Sheridan Cavill, to investigate what this was, whether it was one of our planes or just whatever, just an unknown crash site.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. So it was their job to go ahead and ascertain what was out there and bring representative portions of this back to the base so they could study it to determine, make a final determination of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. As it turns out, our house happened to be on the way to the base, and this is in the wee hours of the morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. So my dad, knowing that he had seen something very special, wanted my mother and myself to look at this also, because as he said, you'll never see this again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. So what he did, he stopped off at the house, awakened my mother and myself, and again the wee hours of the morning, it was summertime, I'd been playing all day with my bicycles and things like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. I was 11 years old at the time, however, and he brought us into the kitchen and saw a smattering of this strange debris on the kitchen floor that he had prepositioned.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. He said, "Look at this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. I think this is what you call a flying saucer or remains thereof."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. I was not quite sure what a flying saucer was at that time, because I was more interested in bicycling and using my 22 rifle for practice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. But at any rate, the first thing he wanted us to do, or me particularly, was to check the debris out, make sure there was no electronic components there, looking for vacuum tubes, resistors, condensers, and things like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. But there wasn't any, and he already knew that, but he wanted me to satisfy my own curiosity as is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. The debris itself consisted of three components, three types.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. There was a foil, a very tough metallic foil of some nature that I can't really describe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. I had to add that I did not see the bending and unbending of it, but my dad witnessed it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. He said if you folded over, it'd unfold and assume its original form.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. In addition, there was a black plastic debris, like a broken phonograph record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. But the strangest thing I saw as being passed around right now was that this is a replica of one of the I-beams, or the beams I saw in the wreckage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. In that, you'll note there's some symbols written along the inside surface of this, and they're a purplish-violet hue, semi-reflective of light.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. But this is basically what this was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. Is this a replica?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. This is a replica.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. If it was original, I wouldn't have it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. Well, you never know, that's why we're asking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. That's right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. But anyway, my dad drove the debris into the base that night, I think it was that night or maybe early next morning, where he was assigned by Colonel Blanchard to fly the material to General Ramey's office in Fort Worth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. This was flown in the belly of a B-29 under armed guard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. So I then saw a picture of my dad taken in General Ramey's office, holding what was obviously a radar target.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. They had already switched the debris.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. And the look on his face is quite telling, he says, "You've got to be kidding me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. This is not what I saw, and this is not what I saw either."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. But anyway, that's where the cover began, in General Ramey's office.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. So when my dad got home, he sat my mother and myself down and said in no uncertain terms, "You will never talk about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. This is a non-event."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. And yes, sir, I was normally a brat, so I was following orders.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. So I never discussed this with my friends or anybody else until after Stan Friedman interviewed my dad in 1978.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. Great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. Let me reemphasize, as a military officer, you took an oath to the Constitution, not to General Ramey or to anybody else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. It's the Constitution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. We move now to your son, Jesse, the third.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. The third, yep.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. Marcel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. Marcel is a French name?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. Marcel?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. Thank you to the distinguished members of the committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. I am here today not to speak as an expert witness to what I have heard and researched about Roswell, but simply to help you get to know two great men, my grandfather, Major Jesse Marcel Sr., and my father, Dr. Jesse Marcel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. My grandfather was a simple man who just wanted to lead a simple life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. Closer to the mic, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. Sorry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. I could restate that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. My grandfather was a simple man who just wanted to lead a simple life, starting at a very early age when he wasn't helping the family with the farm.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. He would sneak away to find parts to build radios.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Later in his life, before entering the war, he would use his skills to build a ham radio that would become a lifelong passion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. He would spend endless hours chatting with people from around the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. Things would change rapidly as we were pulled into the Second World War.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. On his own accord, he went from his job as a civilian draftsman to joining the war effort where he excelled in his duties from the very beginning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. His superiors recognized his aptitude towards problem-solving and sent him to an intelligence school.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. Again, he excelled in his courses and was asked to teach the next incoming class.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. He would eventually end up in the Roswell Air Force Base working in our nuclear bombing program with the 509th Composite.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. With the war over and a life returning to a sense of normalcy, Grandpa would receive a simple order, an order that would change his and most of our lives forever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. The heavens would open up and send us a visitor that would establish the words "alien" and "flying saucer" in the English vernacular, and it was him they sent to investigate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. Decades later, my father followed in Grandpa's footsteps as a military man serving the Navy to train to be a medical doctor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. Soon after, he would settle down in Clancy, Montana to raise a family and continue in the reserves to become a helicopter pilot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. As an ENT, I remember as a child going with my father on his rounds, not the ones at the hospital, but the ones where he would visit his parents in their homes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. He would carry in his little black bag and take care of his patients in the same caring way he would take care of the rest of us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. Back in the office, if a child showed up in ratty shoes to his appointment, a new pair would be waiting for him on their next visit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. I remember very fondly watching him not only build a oscilloscope, but his design and construction of a computer guidance system for the oscilloscope long before there was such a thing, at least on an amateur level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. He would spend endless hours wrapping small green glass switches that would eventually become the brain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. In the summer, we would all pile into a van, RV or whatever form of transportation that we'd have available to us and head to Houma, Louisiana, where my grandparents had lived or had returned to live out the rest of their lives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. I remember so clearly driving down a shell-covered road leading out to their house with the most notable feature being a huge greenhouse that easily equaled the size of their residence that my grandfather lovingly built for his wife, Vio.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. My grandmother had a green thumb like no other.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. My father would send her a tomato plant that would barely survive the short Montana summers into immense vegetation that would reach the floor to ceiling.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. Each morning, my grandfather would lead me to his shop, occupying a space in the house in the garage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. He'd reach up into the rafters and pull down fishing poles that had been there for decades.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. These poles were not made of fiberglass, but of bamboo, very simple, but effective in their trade.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. I recall leaning against a table saw in his workshop, watching him attach the reel with the hand that was missing a digit from some long ago battle with that same table saw.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. He would add the weights and the bobber from two rusty old tackle boxes and finish the session off by showing me how to delicately hook the worm without injuring myself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. All this was not always the case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. We'd make our way to the back door and out on his lawn that ran up against a bayou.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. After a couple of casts, we could sit back and talk and enjoy each other's company.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. My grandfather's other great obsessions were sports.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. LSU provided the teams that he most favored and occupied his weekend TV viewing hours.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. I'll always remember grandpa as a gentle giant who somehow lived the life of a southern gentleman who would be at least partially responsible for change in the way people of our world would look into the night skies, and think to themselves, "Maybe, just maybe, somebody was looking back."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. Today, I share these same stories I learned as a child with my own kids, rousal as a new type of conversation between the kids and their teachers in elementary school.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. The legacy will go on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. And now for your sister.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. Well, first of all, I also want to thank the committee for taking the time to listen to our family's history.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. My name is Denise Marcel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. I am the granddaughter of Major Jesse Marcel, Sr., and the daughter of retired Colonel Dr.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. Marcel, Jr.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. My grandfather was the first military officer at a UFO crash site in Roswell, New Mexico.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. While there, he collected some of the crash site debris.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. He was so amazed by the characteristics of the debris, he decided he had to show my father and grandmother.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. And whatever it was that they had seen, it has had a great impact on our family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. When we moved to Clancy, Montana in the early '70s, my father built a telescope in our backyard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. Now, this wasn't one of your average, ordinary telescopes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. To start, he dug a hole in our backyard the size of a small room.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. For months, I remember my mother and us kids helping him polish this very large mirror.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. From there, he began constructing the telescope, including building a rotating dome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. This was a telescope that was later loaned to the Helena Astronomy Association.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. And he had built this from top to bottom.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. My dad was a man who had witnessed something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. This was a man who was driven.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. That telescope opened up a whole new world for our family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. It was around the age of nine that I first became aware of UFOs, not only because of the telescope, but also because there were times my father and us kids would camp out at night specifically looking for movement in the skies hoping to catch a glimpse of a UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. One has to remember, we didn't have the Internet then, and UFOs were not discussed like they are today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. I do not think that my parents would lead us to believe at such a young age that UFOs existed if my father and grandfather had not witnessed something extraordinary.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. In January of 1997, I accompanied my father and Kent Jeffreys to Washington, D.C. for a hypnosis session that Dr. Neil Hibbler would conduct over the course of three days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. Dr. Hibbler was one of the world's leading experts who used hypnotic regressions for forensic purposes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. I had been very fortunate to be able to participate because I had just been certified as a hypnotherapist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. The sessions were successful.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. While under hypnosis, my father said he couldn't believe how vividly he could see his dad.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. I saw the emotion in his face and how it touched his heart seeing his father so clearly that day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. During the sessions, my father recalls being woken up by my grandfather telling him to come and look at a piece of a flying saucer, a term in which most people, including himself, was not familiar with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. When asked about the materials, my father's descriptions did not waver from what he had been describing throughout the years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. One of the more interesting facets of the debris descriptions are the symbols or hieroglyphics that my father had seen on the eye beam.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. While under hypnosis, the facts remain the same.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. Just like when he was a child, he motioned grabbing the eye beam and holding it above his head to get a better look at the purple reflecting symbols.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. The military claimed that these symbols were merely Christmas-wrapped tape, but it is very unlikely and does not seem possible that three people did not recognize simple holiday decorations on some Scotch tape.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. Another interesting fact my father recalled was that soon after the incident, his father told the family never to talk about it again, that it was a non-event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. Now why would they have to remain silent about a weather or a Mogul balloon doesn't make any sense to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. It has been said that since my father did not remember anything new from those sessions and did not remember seeing any exotic debris, electronic components or anything that resembled motors which they were specifically looking for, this material could not have been from a UFO, that the material was just too mundane.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. I believe this argument works against itself because if it had been some radar device there should have been some very basic electronic components and it would have been mundane.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. Therefore my grandfather would never have brought it home to show his family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. The only explanation that he brought this home was because he was very excited about what he had found.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. My grandfather and father were very dedicated military men and always followed through with their orders.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. They both remained silent to the public about the incident until my grandfather had been approached by Stanton Friedman nearly 30 years after the event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. During interviews my grandfather was asked about the materials and he would say, "It was not anything from this earth that I am quite sure of."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. These words would change the course of the Marcel family.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. The reason he was ordered to go to the site was because he was an intelligence officer familiar with most all of the materials used in aircraft and travel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. He was very qualified to make an assessment of the crash site debris.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. And for the record, my grandfather had nothing to gain when he spoke to Stanton Friedman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. He just felt the same way that I do, that the world should know the truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. It has affected my family's life in so many good ways and some bad, but because of this I was also given the greatest gift of all and that is to have an open mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. I feel that sometimes agendas are put in front of our rights of being citizens and not everything that the government has told us is the truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. Because when it comes to the Roswell incident, I believe my grandfather and my father.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. Last and certainly not least, it is my hope that for my father, my grandfather and all of the other wonderful people who have found the courage to step up and tell the truth this week will be given the respect and recognition that they deserve.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
