→ {"text": "此外，對於今日本小組所代表的這些人——那些在二戰期間英勇為自由而戰、拯救世界免於納粹統治的人們——命運尚未結束對他們國家奉獻精神的考驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. Within two years of the surrender of Germany and Japan, they would be called on again to lead us into an unprecedented awareness that we may be under another threat, another invader.

12. However, this time not from any distant nation, but conceivably from across the vast distance of space.
→ {"text": "然而，這一次不是來自任何遙遠的國家，而是可以想見地來自浩瀚宇宙的彼端。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. Prior to the summer of 1947, visitors from other planets were strictly the fancy of science fiction writers.
→ {"text": "在 1947 年夏天之前，來自其他星球的訪客嚴格來說只是科幻小說作家的想像。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. For lack of outside influence, spaceships were rockets and spacemen looked like our neighbors down the street, all of which were portrayed in popular TV series such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers during that time period.
→ {"text": "由於缺乏外來影響，太空船就是火箭，太空人看起來就像我們街坊鄰居，這些都在當時流行的電視劇集中呈現，例如《飛俠哥頓》和《巴克·羅傑斯》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. Nevertheless, the summer of 1947 would forever change that perception.
→ {"text": "然而，1947 年的夏天將永遠改變這種認知。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. Among others, highly skilled and professional people such as college professors, astronomers and commercial pilots were observing flying disks and military fighters were scrambled on these reported unknown aerial objects.

→ {"text": "諷刺的是，第一支原子彈部隊——509 轟炸大隊——在 1947 年駐紮於 Roswell。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. This was a composite group assigned in the final months of the war, comprised of the best officers, pilots and their crews, doctors, nurses, all in one unit, all with top security clearances, the elite within the United States military, their mission to drop one, and if necessary, additional atomic bombs on Japan.
→ {"text": "這是一支在戰爭最後幾個月組建的混合大隊，由最優秀的軍官、飛行員及其機組人員、醫生、護士組成，全部集中在一個單位，全部擁有最高安全許可，是美國軍方的精銳部隊，他們的任務是在日本投下一枚原子彈，必要時再投下更多枚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. Two years later, they would have another mission, unlike the first.

→ {"text": "1947 年 7 月 8 日，羅斯威爾陸軍航空基地向全世界宣布，他們在城鎮北方的一座牧場捕獲了一架飛碟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. This is a matter of historic fact.
→ {"text": "這是歷史事實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. Detractors would suggest that other UFO accounts are based on a faulty premise, that the phenomenon exists.
→ {"text": "批評者會主張，其他不明飛行物的記載都基於一個錯誤的前提，即這種現象確實存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. It entirely rests on the premise that the United States Army Air Corps recovered a crashed flying saucer.
→ {"text": "它完全建立在這個前提上：美國陸軍航空隊回收了一架墜毀的飛碟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. Historically, the first explanation lasted for all of five hours as it slowly evolved from something otherworldly into a very common off-the-shelf weather balloon device.
→ {"text": "從歷史上看，第一個解釋僅維持了五個小時，因為它緩慢地從某種異世界之物演變成一個非常普通的現成氣象氣球裝置。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. Please allow me to propound a consideration for everyone here present.

35. No need to raise your hands.
→ {"text": "不用舉手。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. As a continuing insult to the integrity and intelligence of the very personnel who were in charge of the atomic bomb at Roswell, officialdom, after 65 years of ridicule and defamation of eyewitnesses, insists that this elite military squadron would all raise their hands.
→ {"text": "作為對 Roswell 負責原子彈任務的這些人員的誠信與智慧的持續侮辱，官方在 65 年來對目擊者的嘲笑與誹謗之後，堅持認為這支精銳軍事部隊的所有人都會舉手。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "然而，你可以把它揉成一團、壓成球狀，然後鬆開手，它會展開並像水一樣在你手中流動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. Was the balloon not a single witness to that alternative explanation?
→ {"text": "難道沒有任何一位證人支持那種氣象氣球的替代解釋嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "此句語意略有反諷意味，可能需要審校"}

41. Since that time, due to eyewitness pressure, along with the assistance of one of your esteemed colleagues, the late Congressman Stephen Schiff of New Mexico, it caused the Pentagon to issue two additional solutions to what was recovered back in 1947.
→ {"text": "自那時起，由於目擊者的壓力，加上各位尊敬的同僚之一——已故的新墨西哥州眾議員史蒂芬·希夫——的協助，導致五角大廈對 1947 年回收的物體提出了兩個額外的解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. The third being Project Mogul, which was the exact same balloon contraption with the inclusion of an acoustic device.
→ {"text": "第三個解釋是莫古爾計畫，也就是完全相同的氣球裝置，只是加入了一個聲學設備。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. The fourth and most baseless of all, time-traveling wooden crash dummies parachuted five years later in 1952.
→ {"text": "第四個也是最毫無根據的解釋，是 1952 年——五年後——空投的時空穿越木製墜落假人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. Even Jay Leno made jest about such fodder after the Pentagon disclosed its fourth version.
→ {"text": "甚至連傑·雷諾在五角大廈披露第四個版本後都拿這種素材開玩笑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. However, which is the consensus of the eyewitnesses?
→ {"text": "然而，證人們的共識是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. Which of the four would provide sufficient evidence, albeit circumstantial, in any court of law?
→ {"text": "這四個版本中哪一個能在任何法庭上提供充分的證據，儘管是間接證據？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. Former U.S. Attorney General Joseph DeGenova has stated, "Circumstantial evidence is often stronger than eyewitness testimony because it's based on the facts.

→ {"text": "宣誓書和不斷增加的臨終證詞、告白，全都陳述第一份關於回收飛碟的新聞稿才是正確的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. As attorneys, you all know that deathbeds are admissible.
→ {"text": "身為律師，各位都知道臨終證詞是可採納的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. If we were to dismiss the Roswell witnesses, then we would have to deny all such end-of-life declarations.
→ {"text": "如果我們要駁回羅斯威爾事件的證人證詞，那麼我們就必須否認所有這類臨終聲明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. There should be no discrimination just because we do not like their testimony.
→ {"text": "不應該僅僅因為我們不喜歡他們的證詞就予以歧視。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
