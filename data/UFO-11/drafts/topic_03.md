## Speaker Group 1

189. Our next witness is also a military officer.
→ {"text": "我們的下一位證人同樣是一位軍官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

190. I'd like to just point out one thing that came up several days in the earlier hearings, and that was the fact that non-disclosure agreements were proffered, and many people were forced into signing these non-disclosure agreements.
→ {"text": "我想先指出前幾天聽證會上提到的一件事，那就是有許多人被迫簽署保密協議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

191. You take an oath when you go into the military, to the Constitution, not to the President, not to a general, not to an admiral.
→ {"text": "當你加入軍隊時，你宣誓效忠的對象是憲法，而非總統、將軍或上將。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

192. You take it to the Constitution to defend the country, and many times you have better judgment on what is defending the country than many of our leaders.
→ {"text": "你向憲法宣誓保衛國家，而在許多時候，對於什麼才是保衛國家，你的判斷力比許多領導人更好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

193. So Colonel, with that caveat, I want you to come forward.
→ {"text": "所以，中校，在此前提下，請您上前作證。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. First of all, let me point out that I prepared a document last night for you all that deals with Project Blue Book and how it was orchestrated to be closed by the military.
→ {"text": "首先，讓我指出，我昨晚為各位準備了一份文件，內容是關於藍皮書計畫如何被軍方策劃關閉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. It was a planned operation to end Project Blue Book completely, and that was circulated I think this morning.
→ {"text": "這是一項有計畫的行動，目的是徹底終結藍皮書計畫，我想該文件今早已經發送給各位了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

196. My name is Kevin Randall, and I'm a retired Lieutenant Colonel with more than 20 years of service with the Army, the Air Force, and the National Guard.
→ {"text": "我的名字是 Kevin Randall，我是一位退役中校，在陸軍、空軍和國民警衛隊服役超過 20 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

197. I served on active duty as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and as an intelligence officer in Iraq.
→ {"text": "我曾在越南擔任現役直升機飛行員，在伊拉克擔任情報官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

198. I served on both active duty and in the active reserve with the Air Force and ended my military career as the provost marshal in the Iowa National Guard.
→ {"text": "我在空軍擔任過現役和預備役，我的軍旅生涯最後擔任的是愛荷華州國民警衛隊的憲兵司令。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

199. I have published more than 20 books about UFOs, starting with the UFO case book in 1989 and currently ending with alien mysteries, conspiracies, and cover-ups just this last month.
→ {"text": "我已出版超過 20 本關於不明飛行物的書籍，從 1989 年的《UFO 案例集》開始，到上個月剛出版的《外星之謎、陰謀與真相掩蓋》。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. I've been working on a book about what can be found in the government files about UFOs for the last several months.
→ {"text": "過去幾個月，我一直在撰寫一本書，內容是關於政府檔案中關於不明飛行物的資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

201. In 1988, I was at a science fiction convention and participated in a debate about UFOs with some of the top science fiction writers in the world.
→ {"text": "1988 年，我參加了一場科幻小說大會，與一些世界頂尖的科幻作家就不明飛行物議題進行辯論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

202. These included Frederik Pohl and I believe George R.R. Martin, who I mention here today just because of his success in recent months.
→ {"text": "參與者包括 Frederik Pohl，我想還有 George R.R. Martin，我今天在這裡提到他，只是因為他近期的成功。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

203. When it was over, Don Schmidt talked to me about the Roswell UFO crash and said that the Center for UFO Studies was beginning some research into it.
→ {"text": "辯論結束後，Don Schmidt 與我討論羅斯威爾事件的不明飛行物墜毀事件，他說 UFO 研究中心正開始針對此事進行調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. He thought my military background might be a benefit because many of the witnesses were retired military, and of course many of the witnesses had been members of the military at the time of the events.
→ {"text": "他認為我的軍事背景可能有幫助，因為許多證人都是退役軍人，當然，事件發生時許多證人也是軍方成員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

205. One of the first things I noticed was that Colonel Thomas Dubose had been identified as General Roger Ramey's aide, but brigadier generals don't have a full colonel as an aide.
→ {"text": "我注意到的第一件事是，托馬斯·杜博斯上校被認定為羅傑·雷米將軍的副官，但准將不會有一位上校擔任副官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

206. Dubose was the chief of staff, a much more important position.
→ {"text": "杜博斯是參謀長，這是一個重要得多的職位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. Dubose would later provide some very interesting testimony about what had been seen and done, including transferring the Roswell debris to SAC headquarters in Washington, D.C. at the time, all documented on videotape.
→ {"text": "杜博斯後來提供了一些非常有趣的證詞，內容關於他所見所為，包括將羅斯威爾事件的殘骸轉送至當時位於華盛頓特區的戰略空軍司令部總部，這一切都記錄在錄影帶上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. We made our first trip to Roswell in February 1989.

→ {"text": "我們從阿爾伯克基開始，原本要與 Frank Joyce 會面，但當我們抵達時，Joyce 以身體不適為由婉拒了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. We met with a group of UFO researchers in Albuquerque, but they turned out to be a group of people more interested in the New Age phenomenon and not exactly UFO researchers.
→ {"text": "我們在阿爾伯克基與一群不明飛行物研究者會面，但結果發現他們更關注新時代現象，並非真正的不明飛行物研究者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. At any rate, they had nothing of interest for us and they had no insights into the Roswell case.
→ {"text": "無論如何，他們沒有任何對我們有用的資訊，對羅斯威爾事件也沒有任何見解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. We headed to Roswell and met with Cliff Stone.
→ {"text": "我們前往羅斯威爾，與 Cliff Stone 會面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. He knew a great deal about UFOs, but was unable to shed any insights into the Roswell case other than the crash site was beyond twin windmills.
→ {"text": "他對不明飛行物知之甚詳，但除了墜毀地點在雙風車之外，無法提供任何關於羅斯威爾事件的見解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. We thought this might be a really good clue until we saw how many twin windmills there were in New Mexico.
→ {"text": "我們原本以為這是一條非常好的線索，直到我們看到新墨西哥州有多少座雙風車。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. Our last interview was with Bill Brazel, son of Mack, who had found the debris.
→ {"text": "我們的最後一次訪談對象是比爾·布拉澤爾，他是發現殘骸的麥克·布拉澤爾的兒子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. I didn't hold out much hope for this, but when we met with him in Carrizoza, New Mexico, he was able to provide us with some very interesting information.
→ {"text": "我對此並不抱太大希望，但當我們在新墨西哥州 Carrizozo 與他會面時，他能夠提供一些非常有趣的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. We chatted for a few minutes and then Brazel said to us, "My dad found this thing," and we were off.
→ {"text": "我們聊了幾分鐘，然後 Brazel 對我們說：「我父親發現了這個東西。」於是我們開始深入討論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

218. Bill told us what had happened to his father Mack, how he had been held at the base in Roswell for a number of days, how he'd been asked not to talk about it.
→ {"text": "比爾告訴我們他父親 Mack 的遭遇，他如何被關押在羅斯威爾基地數日，又是如何被要求不得談論此事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. I suppose you could say he was sworn to secrecy, though there didn't seem to be any threats made to him and no documents signed.
→ {"text": "我想你可以說他被要求保密，儘管似乎沒有對他做出任何威脅，也沒有簽署任何文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. Mack didn't even tell his son Bill much about what he had seen.
→ {"text": "Mack 甚至沒有告訴他兒子 Bill 太多關於他所見之事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. Bill told us that he was out on the ranch in the next couple of years where the object had crashed, or at least touched down briefly, where his dad had found this debris.
→ {"text": "比爾告訴我們，在接下來的幾年裡，他曾在牧場上尋找殘骸，就是那個物體墜毀或至少短暫著陸的地方，也就是他父親發現殘骸的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. He would look for some of it.
→ {"text": "他會尋找一些殘骸碎片。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. He described for us on audio tape three items that he found over the years, a piece of wood-like material that was so tough he couldn't get a sliver on it when he tried to carving on it with his pocket knife, which he said he used to cut barbed wire.
→ {"text": "他在錄音帶中向我們描述了他多年來發現的三件物品：一塊類似木頭的材料，非常堅韌，當他試圖用隨身小刀雕刻時，連一點碎屑都無法削下，而他說這把小刀平時是用來切割鐵絲網的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. He said it was also that it was very lightweight, it was brown, it seemed to be like balsa wood.
→ {"text": "他說這種材料非常輕，呈棕色，看起來像輕木。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. He found a bit of wire that he said you could shine a light into one end and it would come out the other, which of course is fiber optics.
→ {"text": "他找到一小段金屬線，他說你可以在一端照光，光就會從另一端射出，這當然就是光纖。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. And he had a piece of foil, the famous foil, that could be crushed into a ball and then unfold itself without a sign of a wrinkle or a crease.
→ {"text": "他還有一塊金屬箔片，就是那著名的箔片，可以被揉成一團，然後自行展開，沒有任何皺痕或摺痕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. Bill showed it to his father who said, "That looks like some of the contraption I found."
→ {"text": "比爾將它展示給他父親看，他父親說：「這看起來像我找到的那些玩意兒的一部分。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. At this point we realized that there was more than a misidentified weather balloon as the Air Force had suggested in 1947.
→ {"text": "此時我們意識到，這絕不只是空軍在 1947 年所說的被誤認的氣象氣球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. It was clear from the descriptions of the material that Brazel himself had held, which he described for us was not something that had been manufactured on Earth.
→ {"text": "從 Brazel 親手持有過的材料描述來看，他向我們描述的東西顯然不是地球上製造的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. We knew that there was a lot more work to be done.
→ {"text": "我們知道還有很多工作要做。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. I located former major, later retired Colonel, Edwin Easley, who was a provost marshal in the base in 1947.
→ {"text": "我找到了前少校、後來退役的 Edwin Easley 上校，他在 1947 年是該基地的憲兵司令。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. The provost marshal is similar to the chief of police in a city, but a provost marshal also has a number of other duties revolving around security.
→ {"text": "憲兵司令類似於城市的警察局長，但憲兵司令還有許多其他與安全相關的職責。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. Easley, because this was an atomic strike force, had a greater responsibility of officers of a similar grade at other military installations.
→ {"text": "因為這是一支原子打擊部隊，Easley 的責任比其他軍事基地同等級的軍官更為重大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. He told me on audio tape several times that he'd been sworn to secrecy.
→ {"text": "他在錄音帶中多次告訴我，他被要求宣誓保密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. Finally, somewhat exasperated with my questions, he said, "I can't talk about it.
→ {"text": "最後，對我的提問感到有些惱怒，他說：「我不能談論這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. I promised the president that I wouldn't."
→ {"text": "我向總統承諾過不會談論。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. Now, I don't know if he talked to President Truman personally or a representative of the president, which is about the same thing, but whatever the circumstance, he believed he'd promised the president he wouldn't talk about it.
→ {"text": "我不知道他是親自與杜魯門總統交談，還是與總統的代表交談，這基本上是一樣的，但無論情況如何，他相信自己向總統承諾過不會談論此事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. Skeptics ask, "Would the president talk to a major?"
→ {"text": "懷疑論者會問：「總統會與一位少校交談嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. And I say, "An obscure lieutenant colonel talked to the president, and the Doolittle raid was born."
→ {"text": "我會說：「一位默默無聞的中校與總統交談，杜立德空襲行動就此誕生。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. Easley confirmed that Brazel had been held on the base for several days.
→ {"text": "Easley 證實 Brazel 曾被關押在基地數日。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. He said that Brazel was held in the guest house, which is not exactly jail.
→ {"text": "他說 Brazel 被關在招待所，這嚴格來說並不算監獄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. But if you have a guard on the door and you're not allowed to leave, it really doesn't matter how comfortable the quarters are, it still qualifies as a jail.
→ {"text": "但如果門口有守衛，而且你不被允許離開，那麼無論住所多麼舒適，這仍然算是監獄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. I will note that we can prove Brazel was in Roswell after he first reported the find based on the documentation we have.
→ {"text": "我要指出，根據我們擁有的文件，我們可以證明 Brazel 在首次報告發現後確實待在羅斯威爾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. Neighbors tell us he complained to them about being held there.
→ {"text": "鄰居告訴我們，他向他們抱怨被關押在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. Marion Strickland, one of the neighbors, said on videotape that Brazel had been gone for several days and he was mad about it.
→ {"text": "鄰居之一的 Marion Strickland 在錄影帶中說，Brazel 失蹤了好幾天，而且他對此感到憤怒。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. So Easley confirmed part of the story for us.
→ {"text": "所以 Easley 為我們證實了故事的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. Easley was also asked by me if the craft was extraterrestrial.
→ {"text": "我還問 Easley 那個飛行器是否為外星的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. What happened precisely is that I asked him if we were following the right path.
→ {"text": "確切地說，我問他我們是否走在正確的道路上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. He said, "What do you mean?"
→ {"text": "他說：「你是什麼意思？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. I said, "We think it was extraterrestrial," and he said, "Well, that's not the wrong path."
→ {"text": "我說：「我們認為它是外星的。」他說：「嗯，這不是錯誤的方向。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. Every member of Colonel Blanchard's staff, Blanchard being the commanding officer at Roswell at the time, and who later was in line to be chief of staff at the Air Force, gave us a variation of that.
→ {"text": "布蘭查德上校的每一位幕僚都給了我們類似的說法，布蘭查德當時是羅斯威爾的指揮官，後來還被列為空軍參謀長的候選人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. Major Jesse Marcel Sr., an Air Force intelligence officer at the time, said on videotape, "It seems that it was something that came to Earth, but it was not something made on Earth."
→ {"text": "當時擔任空軍情報官的傑西·馬塞爾少校在錄影帶中說：「它似乎是來到地球的東西，但並非地球上製造的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. Let me say here that the skeptics have attempted to slander the memory of Blanchard by suggesting he was a loose cannon, which explains his handling of the discovery and the press release that he ordered issued.
→ {"text": "讓我在此說明，懷疑論者試圖詆毀布蘭查德的名譽，暗示他是一個魯莽的人，藉此解釋他對發現的處理方式以及他下令發布的新聞稿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. But his ratings not long after the Roswell crash by his superior officers, he was rated quite high and there was nothing mentioned about the Roswell case.
→ {"text": "但在羅斯威爾墜毀事件後不久，他的上級軍官對他的評價很高，並且沒有提到羅斯威爾事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. A loose cannon is not promoted to general and is not destined to be the chief of staff.
→ {"text": "一個魯莽的人不會被提升為將軍，也不會被列為參謀長的候選人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. Major Patrick Saunders, the base adjutant, who wouldn't talk much about the Roswell case when I interviewed him, did leave some documentation for us.
→ {"text": "基地副官 Patrick Saunders 少校在我採訪他時不願多談羅斯威爾事件，但他確實為我們留下了一些文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. He wrote on the flyleaf to the book, "UFO Crash at Roswell," "Here's the truth, and I still haven't told anybody anything," and he signed it pat.
→ {"text": "他在《羅斯威爾 UFO 墜毀事件》一書的扉頁上寫道：「這就是真相，而我仍然沒有告訴任何人任何事。」然後簽上了他的名字 Pat。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. This page is called Damage Control, and it tells that files were altered, that they changed personnel records and the code words, and that the bodies and the craft were removed from Roswell.
→ {"text": "這一頁標題為「損害管制」，內容說明檔案被竄改、人事記錄和代號被更改，以及遺體和飛行器被從羅斯威爾移走。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. In a letter to his daughter, which he kindly sent to me, Saunders talked about how they had successfully hid the paper trail.
→ {"text": "在一封他好心寄給我的、寫給女兒的信中，Saunders 談到他們如何成功地隱藏了書面記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. Walter Haut, the man who wrote the press release announcing that they had captured a flying saucer, signed an affidavit about what he had seen, which included craft and bodies.
→ {"text": "Walter Haut，就是撰寫宣布他們捕獲飛碟的新聞稿的那個人，他簽署了一份宣誓書，說明他所見之事，包括飛行器和遺體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. Hott said that in his position as PIO, that he often operated as Colonel Blanchard's aide-de-camp, a colonel not being authorized in aid.
→ {"text": "Haut 說，以他公共資訊官的職位，他經常擔任布蘭查德上校的副官，儘管上校通常不配有副官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. There's been some controversy about Hott's statement because for 20 years that I knew him, he had always said that he just wrote the press release.
→ {"text": "關於 Haut 的聲明一直存在爭議，因為在我認識他的 20 年裡，他一直說他只是寫了新聞稿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. He didn't know anything beyond that.
→ {"text": "除此之外他什麼都不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. He didn't see anything beyond that.
→ {"text": "除此之外他什麼都沒看到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. Then in the affidavit signed and released after his death, he said that he had seen the bodies.
→ {"text": "然後在他死後簽署並公開的宣誓書中，他說他看到了遺體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. There was a direct contradiction of what he had claimed.
→ {"text": "這與他之前的說法完全矛盾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. Ten years before that, I interviewed a fellow named Richard Harris.
→ {"text": "在此之前十年，我採訪了一位名叫 Richard Harris 的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. He was a finance officer at the Roswell Army Airfield, and he helped Patrick Saunders bury the expenditure of money.
→ {"text": "他是羅斯威爾陸軍航空基地的財務官，他協助 Patrick Saunders 掩埋資金支出記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. Let me digress here for just a moment.
→ {"text": "讓我在此稍作離題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. Everything has to be paid for by the military, or in the military, and all expenditures must be accounted for.
→ {"text": "軍隊的一切都必須付費，所有支出都必須列入帳目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. You can't send an aircraft on a training flight, for example, without naming a funding source for that flight.
→ {"text": "例如，你不能在沒有指定資金來源的情況下派遣飛機進行訓練飛行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. Of course, you can have a cross-country training flight from Roswell to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, a perfectly legitimate expense, and you can always put the records of an alien craft or the bodies on the flight without having to note it.
→ {"text": "當然，你可以安排一次從羅斯威爾到俄亥俄州代頓市萊特機場的越野訓練飛行，這是完全合法的支出，而且你可以將外星飛行器或遺體的記錄放在飛行中而無需註明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. The flight is paid for out of the training budget, and there is no need to mention the genesis of the mission, which is to take the stuff to Ohio.
→ {"text": "飛行費用從訓練預算中支付，無需提及任務的真正目的，也就是將這些東西運往俄亥俄州。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. So Harris confirmed some of what Saunders had said, but more importantly, he told me that he'd seen the bodies, or he had almost seen the bodies.
→ {"text": "所以 Harris 證實了 Saunders 所說的部分內容，但更重要的是，他告訴我他看到了遺體，或者說他幾乎看到了遺體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. According to Harris, he was in a hangar where the bodies were temporarily located, and Haught asked him if he wanted to see them.
→ {"text": "根據 Harris 的說法，他在一個臨時存放遺體的機庫裡，Haut 問他是否想看看它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. Harris said that he put his hand on the door knob, but he didn't turn it.
→ {"text": "Harris 說他把手放在門把上，但沒有轉動它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. This stunned me, given the chance I would have opened the door, but that's today in 1947.
→ {"text": "這讓我很震驚，如果是我有機會我會打開門，但那是今天的想法，而非 1947 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. Harris said that he didn't want to see that.
→ {"text": "Harris 說他不想看那個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. But it confirms to an extent what Walter Haught said about seeing the bodies, and as I say, Harris told me this 10 years before Walter Haught mentioned anything like that.
→ {"text": "但這在某種程度上證實了 Walter Haut 關於看到遺體的說法，而且如我所說，Harris 在 Walter Haut 提到任何類似的事情之前十年就告訴我這件事了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. Now I have noticed I have just a minute left, and I had some interesting things I wanted to cover, but let me just say this.
→ {"text": "現在我注意到我只剩一分鐘了，我還有一些有趣的事情想談，但讓我只說這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. The Air Force claimed this was Project Mogul.
→ {"text": "空軍聲稱這是莫古爾計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. The documentation suggests it was flight number four, but when we look at the diary created by Dr. Albert Crary, who is the leader of the project, he said flight number four had been canceled.
→ {"text": "文件顯示這是第四次飛行，但當我們查看計畫負責人阿爾伯特·克雷里博士的日記時，他說第四次飛行已經取消了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. There was no flight number four.
→ {"text": "根本就沒有第四次飛行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. There is a note that says that they had made it some kind of a test flight, but it's not part of the official record of the project in New Mexico.
→ {"text": "有一條筆記說他們進行了某種測試飛行，但這不是新墨西哥州該計畫官方記錄的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. Mogul, by the way, was not highly classified.
→ {"text": "順便說一句，莫古爾計畫並非高度機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. The equipment was off the shelf.
→ {"text": "設備都是現成的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. What they were doing in New Mexico was published in the newspapers, and worse still, according to the documentation, these flights had to be announced in the FAA notums.
→ {"text": "他們在新墨西哥州所做的事情已在報紙上發表，更糟的是，根據文件記錄，這些飛行必須在聯邦航空總署的飛航公告中公布。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. These notices to airmen were items that could affect aerial navigation.
→ {"text": "這些飛航公告是可能影響空中導航的項目。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. An array of balloons, some 600 feet long, drifting along at tens of thousands of feet fit that definition.
→ {"text": "一串長達約 600 英尺的氣球，在數萬英尺高空漂流，符合這個定義。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. Moore was aware of that in 1995, wrote that they had not contacted the FAA because they didn't expect this mythical flight number four to leave the restricted area.
→ {"text": "Moore 在 1995 年意識到這一點，他寫道他們沒有聯繫聯邦航空總署，因為他們不期望這個神話般的第四次飛行會離開限制區域。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. I wanted to mention one final thing, and I see my time has expired.
→ {"text": "我想提到最後一件事，但我看到我的時間已經到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

292. But on July 8th, they made the press release.
→ {"text": "但在 7 月 8 日，他們發布了新聞稿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. On July 9th, according to the newspapers, the United Press reported, "Report to flying saucers whizzing through the sky fell off sharply today as the Army and the Navy began a concentrated campaign to stop the rumors."
→ {"text": "根據報紙報導，7 月 9 日，聯合通訊社報導：「今天關於飛碟在天空中呼嘯而過的報導急劇減少，因為陸軍和海軍開始集中力量制止謠言。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. The question is, what happened to make them stop on July 9th when they had published everything else?
→ {"text": "問題是，在他們發布了其他所有內容之後，是什麼讓他們在 7 月 9 日停止了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
