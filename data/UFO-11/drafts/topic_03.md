## Speaker Group 1

189. Our next witness is also a military officer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. I'd like to just point out one thing that came up several days in the earlier hearings, and that was the fact that non-disclosure agreements were proffered, and many people were forced into signing these non-disclosure agreements.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. You take an oath when you go into the military, to the Constitution, not to the President, not to a general, not to an admiral.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. You take it to the Constitution to defend the country, and many times you have better judgment on what is defending the country than many of our leaders.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. So Colonel, with that caveat, I want you to come forward.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. First of all, let me point out that I prepared a document last night for you all that deals with Project Blue Book and how it was orchestrated to be closed by the military.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. It was a planned operation to end Project Blue Book completely, and that was circulated I think this morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. My name is Kevin Randall, and I'm a retired Lieutenant Colonel with more than 20 years of service with the Army, the Air Force, and the National Guard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. I served on active duty as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and as an intelligence officer in Iraq.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. I served on both active duty and in the active reserve with the Air Force and ended my military career as the provost marshal in the Iowa National Guard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. I have published more than 20 books about UFOs, starting with the UFO case book in 1989 and currently ending with alien mysteries, conspiracies, and cover-ups just this last month.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. I've been working on a book about what can be found in the government files about UFOs for the last several months.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. In 1988, I was at a science fiction convention and participated in a debate about UFOs with some of the top science fiction writers in the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. These included Frederik Pohl and I believe George R.R. Martin, who I mention here today just because of his success in recent months.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. When it was over, Don Schmidt talked to me about the Roswell UFO crash and said that the Center for UFO Studies was beginning some research into it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. He thought my military background might be a benefit because many of the witnesses were retired military, and of course many of the witnesses had been members of the military at the time of the events.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. One of the first things I noticed was that Colonel Thomas Dubose had been identified as General Roger Ramey's aide, but brigadier generals don't have a full colonel as an aide.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. Dubose was the chief of staff, a much more important position.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. Dubose would later provide some very interesting testimony about what had been seen and done, including transferring the Roswell debris to SAC headquarters in Washington, D.C. at the time, all documented on videotape.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. We made our first trip to Roswell in February 1989.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. We started in Albuquerque and had a meeting with Frank Joyce, but when we arrived, Joyce begged off saying that he was ill.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. We met with a group of UFO researchers in Albuquerque, but they turned out to be a group of people more interested in the New Age phenomenon and not exactly UFO researchers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. At any rate, they had nothing of interest for us and they had no insights into the Roswell case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. We headed to Roswell and met with Cliff Stone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. He knew a great deal about UFOs, but was unable to shed any insights into the Roswell case other than the crash site was beyond twin windmills.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. We thought this might be a really good clue until we saw how many twin windmills there were in New Mexico.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. Our last interview was with Bill Brazel, son of Mack, who had found the debris.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. I didn't hold out much hope for this, but when we met with him in Carrizoza, New Mexico, he was able to provide us with some very interesting information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. We chatted for a few minutes and then Brazel said to us, "My dad found this thing," and we were off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. Bill told us what had happened to his father Mack, how he had been held at the base in Roswell for a number of days, how he'd been asked not to talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. I suppose you could say he was sworn to secrecy, though there didn't seem to be any threats made to him and no documents signed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. Mack didn't even tell his son Bill much about what he had seen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. Bill told us that he was out on the ranch in the next couple of years where the object had crashed, or at least touched down briefly, where his dad had found this debris.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. He would look for some of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. He described for us on audio tape three items that he found over the years, a piece of wood-like material that was so tough he couldn't get a sliver on it when he tried to carving on it with his pocket knife, which he said he used to cut barbed wire.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. He said it was also that it was very lightweight, it was brown, it seemed to be like balsa wood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. He found a bit of wire that he said you could shine a light into one end and it would come out the other, which of course is fiber optics.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. And he had a piece of foil, the famous foil, that could be crushed into a ball and then unfold itself without a sign of a wrinkle or a crease.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. Bill showed it to his father who said, "That looks like some of the contraption I found."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. At this point we realized that there was more than a misidentified weather balloon as the Air Force had suggested in 1947.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. It was clear from the descriptions of the material that Brazel himself had held, which he described for us was not something that had been manufactured on Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. We knew that there was a lot more work to be done.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. I located former major, later retired Colonel, Edwin Easley, who was a provost marshal in the base in 1947.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. The provost marshal is similar to the chief of police in a city, but a provost marshal also has a number of other duties revolving around security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. Easley, because this was an atomic strike force, had a greater responsibility of officers of a similar grade at other military installations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. He told me on audio tape several times that he'd been sworn to secrecy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. Finally, somewhat exasperated with my questions, he said, "I can't talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. I promised the president that I wouldn't."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. Now, I don't know if he talked to President Truman personally or a representative of the president, which is about the same thing, but whatever the circumstance, he believed he'd promised the president he wouldn't talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. Skeptics ask, "Would the president talk to a major?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. And I say, "An obscure lieutenant colonel talked to the president, and the Doolittle raid was born."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. Easley confirmed that Brazel had been held on the base for several days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. He said that Brazel was held in the guest house, which is not exactly jail.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. But if you have a guard on the door and you're not allowed to leave, it really doesn't matter how comfortable the quarters are, it still qualifies as a jail.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. I will note that we can prove Brazel was in Roswell after he first reported the find based on the documentation we have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. Neighbors tell us he complained to them about being held there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. Marion Strickland, one of the neighbors, said on videotape that Brazel had been gone for several days and he was mad about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. So Easley confirmed part of the story for us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. Easley was also asked by me if the craft was extraterrestrial.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. What happened precisely is that I asked him if we were following the right path.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. He said, "What do you mean?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. I said, "We think it was extraterrestrial," and he said, "Well, that's not the wrong path."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. Every member of Colonel Blanchard's staff, Blanchard being the commanding officer at Roswell at the time, and who later was in line to be chief of staff at the Air Force, gave us a variation of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. Major Jesse Marcel Sr., an Air Force intelligence officer at the time, said on videotape, "It seems that it was something that came to Earth, but it was not something made on Earth."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

253. Let me say here that the skeptics have attempted to slander the memory of Blanchard by suggesting he was a loose cannon, which explains his handling of the discovery and the press release that he ordered issued.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. But his ratings not long after the Roswell crash by his superior officers, he was rated quite high and there was nothing mentioned about the Roswell case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. A loose cannon is not promoted to general and is not destined to be the chief of staff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. Major Patrick Saunders, the base adjutant, who wouldn't talk much about the Roswell case when I interviewed him, did leave some documentation for us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. He wrote on the flyleaf to the book, "UFO Crash at Roswell," "Here's the truth, and I still haven't told anybody anything," and he signed it pat.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

258. This page is called Damage Control, and it tells that files were altered, that they changed personnel records and the code words, and that the bodies and the craft were removed from Roswell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. In a letter to his daughter, which he kindly sent to me, Saunders talked about how they had successfully hid the paper trail.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. Walter Haut, the man who wrote the press release announcing that they had captured a flying saucer, signed an affidavit about what he had seen, which included craft and bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. Hott said that in his position as PIO, that he often operated as Colonel Blanchard's aide-de-camp, a colonel not being authorized in aid.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. There's been some controversy about Hott's statement because for 20 years that I knew him, he had always said that he just wrote the press release.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. He didn't know anything beyond that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. He didn't see anything beyond that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. Then in the affidavit signed and released after his death, he said that he had seen the bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. There was a direct contradiction of what he had claimed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. Ten years before that, I interviewed a fellow named Richard Harris.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. He was a finance officer at the Roswell Army Airfield, and he helped Patrick Saunders bury the expenditure of money.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. Let me digress here for just a moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. Everything has to be paid for by the military, or in the military, and all expenditures must be accounted for.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. You can't send an aircraft on a training flight, for example, without naming a funding source for that flight.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. Of course, you can have a cross-country training flight from Roswell to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, a perfectly legitimate expense, and you can always put the records of an alien craft or the bodies on the flight without having to note it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. The flight is paid for out of the training budget, and there is no need to mention the genesis of the mission, which is to take the stuff to Ohio.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. So Harris confirmed some of what Saunders had said, but more importantly, he told me that he'd seen the bodies, or he had almost seen the bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. According to Harris, he was in a hangar where the bodies were temporarily located, and Haught asked him if he wanted to see them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. Harris said that he put his hand on the door knob, but he didn't turn it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. This stunned me, given the chance I would have opened the door, but that's today in 1947.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. Harris said that he didn't want to see that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. But it confirms to an extent what Walter Haught said about seeing the bodies, and as I say, Harris told me this 10 years before Walter Haught mentioned anything like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. Now I have noticed I have just a minute left, and I had some interesting things I wanted to cover, but let me just say this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. The Air Force claimed this was Project Mogul.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. The documentation suggests it was flight number four, but when we look at the diary created by Dr. Albert Crary, who is the leader of the project, he said flight number four had been canceled.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. There was no flight number four.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. There is a note that says that they had made it some kind of a test flight, but it's not part of the official record of the project in New Mexico.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. Mogul, by the way, was not highly classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. The equipment was off the shelf.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. What they were doing in New Mexico was published in the newspapers, and worse still, according to the documentation, these flights had to be announced in the FAA notums.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. These notices to airmen were items that could affect aerial navigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. An array of balloons, some 600 feet long, drifting along at tens of thousands of feet fit that definition.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. Moore was aware of that in 1995, wrote that they had not contacted the FAA because they didn't expect this mythical flight number four to leave the restricted area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. I wanted to mention one final thing, and I see my time has expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. But on July 8th, they made the press release.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. On July 9th, according to the newspapers, the United Press reported, "Report to flying saucers whizzing through the sky fell off sharply today as the Army and the Navy began a concentrated campaign to stop the rumors."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. The question is, what happened to make them stop on July 9th when they had published everything else?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. I will say this, in 1947, the Air Force said what fell at Roswell was a weather balloon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. When they made their investigation in the mid-1990s, they said they lied about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. It wasn't a weather balloon, it was a weather balloon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. They just changed the name, it counted a cluster of balloons, it was nothing special about them, they were just weather balloons tethered together in a long train, but it did not answer the question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. Why did the service members at Roswell fail to identify it as such?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. Why could they not identify a weather balloon, no matter what name you apply to it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
