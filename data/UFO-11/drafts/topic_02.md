## Speaker Group 1

78. Mr. Friedman, you're an old witness here, so you know the rules.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. I am the oldest witness here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. You're not even close to us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. Go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. You're right. I'd like to show the opticals, the visuals that I supplied, just to go through them quickly, very quickly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. Biggest study ever done for the United States Air Force, Project Blue Book Special Report 14, 3,200 sightings never referred to by the debunkers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. The next one, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. Symposium on Unidentified Flying Objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. Those are the hearings of July 29, 1968.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. I was the youngest then of the contributors to that. 254 pages, well worth looking at.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. The next one, please, Dr. J. Allen Hynek's book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. He was only the Air Force Project Blue Book consultant for 20 years and chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. You'd think when astronomers take wax at UFOs, they would at least look at Allen's book, but they don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. The next one, there's the University of Colorado study, 965 pages, $539,000 it cost us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. The press gave the vision that this proved there was nothing to flying saucers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. A more careful look at the report shows that 30% of the 117 cases studied in detail could not be identified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. You didn't hear that when the report came out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. So let's get those out of the way and then we'll go on to my prepared testimony here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. People have often asked me why I think aliens would want to visit Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. I have noted many reasons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. Graduate students doing their thesis research on a primitive society, mining of dense metals as we have the densest planet in the solar system, et cetera.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. But most important to me is that I consider all civilizations would be concerned about their own survival and security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. That means keeping tabs on those primitive societies in the neighborhood that show signs of being able to bother them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. By July 1947, it was clear to any aliens in the neighborhood that we have a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare and that soon, less than 100 years, which is nothing on a cosmic time scale, we would be able to visit aliens out there taking our brand of friendship, everybody else calls it hostility, the facts that demonstrate that our nuclear weapons, powerful rockets, and radar, the beginning of advanced electronics.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. Isn't it amazing that the only place in the world at that time where you could study all three of these was southeastern New Mexico, our first nuclear weapon was detonated at Trinity site, White Sands Missile Range, July 16th, 1945.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. White Sands is where we're testing captured German V2 rockets and some of our own.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. And that's where we had our best radar to track the rockets.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. Sometimes they went south instead of north.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. And of course, as it turns out, there were at least three flying saucer crashes in New Mexico.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. In early July 1947, there was a crash near the small town of Corona, less than 80 miles from Roswell Army Airfield and nearby Roswell. 100 miles west, there was an unpublicized crash at about the same time, the Plains of San Agustin, new book coming out this year about that, not by me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. Book by Arthur Campbell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. And there was a crash retrieval operation in Aztec, New Mexico in the Four Corners area March 1948.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. New book is available.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. I was the first to hear about the Corona crash, as discussed in my book, "Crash at Corona" with Don Berliner.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. Simple story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. I began lecturing about flying saucers in 1967 while working as a nuclear physicist in industry for little companies such as GE, GM, Westinghouse, et cetera.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. In 1978, I was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to speak at Louisiana State University.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. I was at a TV station to do three interviews to promote my lecture that evening at LSU.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. I had done two of the interviews.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. The third reporter was nowhere to be found.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. The station manager knew I had other things to do, was giving me coffee, looking at his watch.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. He was embarrassed, but he wanted to keep me there for that third interview.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. Out of the blue, he said, "The guy you really ought to talk to is Jesse Marcel."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. He handled the wreckage of one of those saucers when he was in the military and practically dropped my teeth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. What do you know about him?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. He lives in Houma.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. That didn't tell me anything, because I didn't know where Houma was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. It's a big city in Louisiana.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. I did visit there later to speak to Jesse.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. We are ham radio buddies, he told me, the station manager.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. You should talk to him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. Okay, the third reporter, I've heard lots of stories, and you've sort of put it in your gray basket.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. We'll see what we can do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. There was a great crowd the next day, that night, and the next day I was at the airport early, called information, got a number for Jesse Marcel, and called him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. He told me his story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. As I found out later, he couldn't deny his involvement, as his name was in papers across the country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. I didn't know it when I called him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. People said, "Why did he talk to you?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. Well, he didn't have a choice.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. He had to talk to somebody, because he couldn't lie about it, when it was public record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. Soon thereafter, I heard about the Plains of San Agustin crash, after a lecture in Bemidji, Minnesota.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. I shared both stories with an old colleague from Pittsburgh, Bill Moore, who lived in Minnesota.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. He had a third story, from the Flying Saucer Review in the UK, which is still being published, which is rather amazing, that it's gone on this long.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. An English actor named Huey Green had noted that he heard about a crash saucer in New Mexico, when driving from Los Angeles to Philadelphia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. The date was recalled as early July, 1947.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. That was not a trip you made very often back then.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. You can imagine what the roads were like at that time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. Bill went to the University of Minnesota library, looked at the newspaper department, found the story, verifying what I'd been told, giving us new names.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. The next year and a half, we found 62 people, in conjunction with that case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. That went up to 92, a few years later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. These guys have had, I don't know, how many hundreds since then.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. Remember, we're talking about the most elite military group in the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. I got lucky.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. I called the Roswell Daily Record, which I hadn't known existed before that, looked in Editor and Publisher.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. I mentioned that I had some articles noting a crash of a saucer, as reported by a Walter Haut, it's spelled four different ways.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. I was shocked to be told, before I could finish the sentence, "Oh, his wife works here."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. Boy, talk about serendipity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. How lucky can you get?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. I talked to the wife, talked to Walter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. He was a big help to all of us in our research on Roswell, well thought of throughout the Roswell community.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. I found the son of the rancher.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. Telephone operators were nice then.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. I said, "I'd like to find anybody named Brazel."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. What city?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. Southeastern New Mexico.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. She said, "Oh, I've got a William Brazel in Carrizozo."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. Is that in Southeastern New Mexico?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. Yes, okay, let's take it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. He had just gotten his phone two weeks before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. How lucky can you get, I guess?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. One I planned, one of the people that shows up in a key picture that got very wide distribution is at that time Colonel Thomas Jefferson Dubose, Chief of Staff to General Roger Raimi, head of the Eighth Air Force, which is where the 509th was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. This is in Fort Worth, Texas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. I checked with West Point, son of a gun, he was still alive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. He was in his 80s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. He was very forthcoming when I went to visit him, and Don and I went down there and we have it on tape.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. I've got a DVD out there, our interview with General, retired General Dubose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. You don't often get a chance to talk to a general about something this important.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. Several of us here will be speaking at the Roswell Festival, which is early July.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. Much of the early Roswell research, I better stress, was done before the internet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. It was hard work finding people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. You called information, hoped they knew something, and so forth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. You're very lucky that today a key witness is right here, Colonel Jesse A. Marcel Jr., a medical doctor, called back in the Army at age 68 to fight in Iraq, flew over 200 combat hours as a flight surgeon in helicopters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. His father was Major Jesse Marcel, and he also handled wreckage in 1947.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. There are many Roswell debunkers who do their research by proclamation, not investigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. Their motto is, "Don't bother me with the facts, my mind is made up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. If the public doesn't know, I won't tell them."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. We've all found these people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. As a physicist, I want facts, not fantasy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. So I am most grateful for this opportunity to be here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
