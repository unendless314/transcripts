    when the University of Colorado was asked to help him make a decision about Project Blue Book, let's put it that way,
    and when the University of Colorado wrote a report, I think you're all correct in saying that what the report said wasn't
    exactly the way it was characterized even by the, certainly by the government, and even by, well, and by the media as
    well, but isn't it true that it didn't say anything about it all being nonsense, it just said we don't want to fund additional
    work on collection, collecting this data, that we are publishing to the world, I mean, there are 101 incidents published
    that we can read about from Project Blue Book,

    who at the time, in a similar way to how Jesse Marcel Sr. said he had received these kinds of materials and they had these
    certain property trades, which he said almost immediately to people.
