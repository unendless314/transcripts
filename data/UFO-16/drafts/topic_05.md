## Speaker Group 1

397. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "謝謝主席女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. I was happy to hear in this afternoon's session after three and a half days being here that Mr. Huneeus, Pope, and Cameron did say the U.S. has participated a bit.
→ {"text": "在這裡待了三天半之後，我很高興在今天下午的會議中聽到烏內烏斯先生、波普先生和卡麥隆先生都表示美國確實有所參與。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Huneeus 音譯為烏內烏斯"}

399. I've been led to believe up until an hour ago that we hadn't done anything and that we were the big bear in the room.
→ {"text": "直到一小時前，我一直被引導相信我們什麼都沒做，而且我們是房間裡的大熊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "big bear 比喻美國是威脅性的存在"}

400. So I'm glad to hear that you acknowledge that we've done something.
→ {"text": "所以我很高興聽到各位承認我們確實做了一些事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. Yes, absolutely.
→ {"text": "是的，絕對如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. You further went on to say the CIA was sued and released theirs in 1977.
→ {"text": "你們進一步提到CIA在1977年被起訴並公開了檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. I think you said that, Mr. Juneyus, which is good.
→ {"text": "我想是烏內烏斯先生說的，這很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "修正 Juneyus → Huneeus"}

404. I don't want you...
→ {"text": "我不想讓你們……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. There's a little editorial right here, that's all.
→ {"text": "這裡只是一點評論，就這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. Then the FBI did file a suit later and released it.
→ {"text": "然後FBI後來也被起訴並公開了檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. I think, Mr. Cameron, you said, yeah, they released it.
→ {"text": "我想卡麥隆先生說過，是的，他們公開了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. They're sitting files, but not the real thing.
→ {"text": "那些是目擊檔案，但不是真正的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "siting files 應為 sighting files"}

410. I think my question on all of that, releasing of the files, and I'm glad they did it, ordered by the court or otherwise, and that you all acknowledge that.
→ {"text": "我對所有這些檔案公開的問題是，我很高興他們這麼做了，無論是法院命令還是其他原因，而且各位都承認這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. It's good for our country to know that, for us here on the panel, for sure.
→ {"text": "我們國家知道這一點很好，對我們這些委員會成員來說確實如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. Did they acknowledge, do they believe that UFOs are real or not?
→ {"text": "他們有承認嗎，他們相信UFO是真的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. Did they address after releasing the files, or they just gave you paper and you had to shift through them?
→ {"text": "他們在公開檔案後有說明嗎，還是只是給你們一堆文件，讓你們自己篩選？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. I know we didn't get to meet one again, but did they say one way or the other, whether UFOs are real or that extraterrestrial is a real phenomenon?
→ {"text": "我知道我們沒機會再見到外星人，但他們有明確表態嗎，無論是UFO是真的，還是外星現象是真實的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. Well, I mean, the problem is that the files they released are sort of the mundane files, like grants at the siting files, or they're very old, historical files.
→ {"text": "嗯，我的意思是，問題在於他們公開的檔案都是些平凡的文件，像是准予的目擊檔案，或者是非常古老的歷史檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. Siting files means that they cited something somewhere.
→ {"text": "目擊檔案的意思是他們在某處目擊了某物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. Correct, but what we would want to see is some kind of conclusion, and those kind of documents seem to be- They were not included.
→ {"text": "沒錯，但我們想看到的是某種結論，而那類文件似乎——它們沒有被包含在內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. I mean, there are some conclusions, for instance, in the Condon Report, which was this famous project by the University of Colorado, but that was distorted, too, because they wanted to close Blue Book.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，確實有一些結論，例如康登報告（Condon Report），那是科羅拉多大學的著名專案，但那也被扭曲了，因為他們想關閉藍皮書計畫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. Now, some of the case histories in the Condon Report are valid, and actually about 30 percent of the case histories in the Condon Report are unexplained.
→ {"text": "現在，康登報告中的一些案例歷史是有效的，實際上康登報告中約30%的案例歷史無法解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. That's how much you will find in the U.S. files, that there are a certain percentage of cases that are unexplained.
→ {"text": "在美國檔案中你會發現，有一定比例的案例無法解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. So how would you sum what they've released, and do you know of a U.S. ... Can we conclude a position from our government on this issue, based on what they've released with CIA or FBI?
→ {"text": "那麼你如何總結他們公開的內容，你知道美國……我們能根據CIA或FBI公開的內容，得出我們政府在這個議題上的立場嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. Yes.
→ {"text": "可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. The truth is, it's confusing.
→ {"text": "事實是，這很令人困惑。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. I mean, some people, like there is Colonel John Alexander.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，有些人，像是約翰·亞歷山大上校（Colonel John Alexander）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. He was involved in some study at the Pentagon in the 1980s.
→ {"text": "他在1980年代參與了五角大廈的一些研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. So this would have been much, much later, when there wasn't Blue Book, all that was old history, and he claims it was not a formal project in the sense that they had to issue reports and things, but it was obviously tolerated by his superiors, and they went around and they briefed a number of people, including high-level people, like admirals and generals and General Abramson, the head of the Star Wars SDI project, and people like that, very high-level people.
→ {"text": "所以這是很久很久之後的事了，當時已經沒有藍皮書計畫，那些都是舊歷史了。他聲稱這不是正式專案，不需要發布報告之類的，但顯然得到了上級的容忍。他們四處向許多人做簡報，包括高層人士，像是海軍上將、將軍，還有星戰計畫（SDI）主管艾布拉姆森將軍，諸如此類的非常高層的人物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. And he wrote a book about this, so I'm not revealing anything that is unknown.
→ {"text": "他為此寫了一本書，所以我沒有透露任何未知的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. So they would brief these people, because this group of scientists that all had clearances and were working within the Pentagon on the military-industrial complex, would brief these generals and staff, because they thought that there was some kind of big project going on, according to Alexander.
→ {"text": "所以他們會向這些人做簡報，因為這群科學家都有安全許可，在五角大廈的軍工複合體內工作。根據亞歷山大的說法，他們會向這些將軍和幕僚做簡報，因為他們認為有某種大型專案正在進行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. And then what would happen, if you read his book, is that most of these generals or admirals say, "No, we don't have anything.
→ {"text": "然後如果你讀他的書，會發現大多數這些將軍或上將會說：「不，我們沒有任何東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. I mean, we have no project."
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我們沒有專案。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. So that was the official record, but he tells in his book some anecdotes that then after the official meeting was over, then the admiral will come and whisper to him, "But let me tell you about my sighting."
→ {"text": "所以那是正式記錄，但他在書中講述了一些軼事，就是正式會議結束後，上將會過來對他耳語：「但讓我告訴你我的目擊經歷。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. So this is the kind of stuff you encounter.
→ {"text": "所以這就是你會遇到的那種情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. That's kind of soft, but there was something.
→ {"text": "那有點含糊，但確實有些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. There was something.
→ {"text": "確實有些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. It was something.
→ {"text": "有些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. Mr. Cameron, thank you very much, Mr. Honest.
→ {"text": "卡麥隆先生，非常感謝，烏內烏斯先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Mr. Honest 應為 Mr. Huneeus"}

440. You said, Mr. Cameron, that we were waiting for America to make the first move.
→ {"text": "卡麥隆先生，你說我們在等待美國邁出第一步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. What move would that be?
→ {"text": "那會是什麼行動？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. What do you speak when you say that?
→ {"text": "你說那個的時候是指什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. The move to disclosure, to identifying the fact that it's an ET phenomena or whatever it is, I have heard stories from other governments, sort of off the record, they were asked, "Will you disclose?"
→ {"text": "真相揭露的行動，確認這是外星現象或不管它是什麼。我聽說過其他政府的一些非正式說法，有人問他們：「你們會揭露嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. And they said, "As soon as the Americans disclose, we'll be a close second."
→ {"text": "他們說：「美國人一揭露，我們就緊接著第二個。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. I've heard stories like that.
→ {"text": "我聽過這樣的說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. That's where I think the American sort of, especially when it comes to NATO, if you take a look at the NATO thing, America is basically the main thing in NATO.
→ {"text": "這就是我認為美國某種程度上，特別是涉及北約（NATO）時，如果你看北約這件事，美國基本上是北約的主導力量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. Everybody sort of takes their lead.
→ {"text": "每個人都某種程度上跟隨他們的帶領。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. They have a lot of power.
→ {"text": "他們有很大的權力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. I think it's the same thing in this field that ...
→ {"text": "我認為在這個領域也是同樣的情況……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. So the world is waiting for the US to say yay or nay on UFOs?
→ {"text": "所以世界在等待美國對UFO說贊成還是反對？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. Or set the policy or determine ...
→ {"text": "或是制定政策或決定……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. Or set the policy?
→ {"text": "或是制定政策？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. Set ... Well, the policy is basically sort of being set by the Americans.
→ {"text": "制定……嗯，政策基本上某種程度上是由美國人制定的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. I thought the Americans hadn't done much on it.
→ {"text": "我以為美國人在這方面沒做什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. Well, I mean, as I say, I think they've disclosed stuff.
→ {"text": "嗯，我的意思是，如我所說，我認為他們確實揭露了一些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. They have ... I mean, and they have disclosed a lot of documents.
→ {"text": "他們有……我的意思是，他們確實公開了很多文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. I mean, if you get to documents ...
→ {"text": "我的意思是，如果你要說文件的話……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. You said that.
→ {"text": "你說過了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. The United States Library has disclosed thousands of pages of documents.
→ {"text": "美國圖書館公開了數千頁的文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. And so, I mean, there are documents.
→ {"text": "所以，我的意思是，確實有文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. It's the official conclusions.
→ {"text": "是官方結論的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. It's the official ...
→ {"text": "是官方……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. There are no conclusions from the documents.
→ {"text": "這些文件沒有結論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. Yeah, like the real top secret documents you won't find no matter what country you go to.
→ {"text": "是的，就像真正的最高機密文件，無論你去哪個國家都找不到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. And our country has not concluded ...
→ {"text": "而我們國家並沒有得出結論……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. It's still on the position that there's nothing to it.
→ {"text": "仍然堅持沒有這回事的立場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. And every other government, I think, goes by that and takes the same position.
→ {"text": "我認為其他所有政府都遵循這一點，採取同樣的立場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. That is a position.
→ {"text": "那就是一種立場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. If you said they've released the files under court order, CIA and FBI ...
→ {"text": "如果你說他們在法院命令下公開了檔案，CIA和FBI……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
