## Speaker Group 1

397. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. I was happy to hear in this afternoon's session after three and a half days being here that Mr. Huneeus, Pope, and Cameron did say the U.S. has participated a bit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. I've been led to believe up until an hour ago that we hadn't done anything and that we were the big bear in the room.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. So I'm glad to hear that you acknowledge that we've done something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. Yes, absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. You further went on to say the CIA was sued and released theirs in 1977.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. I think you said that, Mr. Juneyus, which is good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. I don't want you...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. There's a little editorial right here, that's all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. Then the FBI did file a suit later and released it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. I think, Mr. Cameron, you said, yeah, they released it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. They're sitting files, but not the real thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. I think my question on all of that, releasing of the files, and I'm glad they did it, ordered by the court or otherwise, and that you all acknowledge that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. It's good for our country to know that, for us here on the panel, for sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. Did they acknowledge, do they believe that UFOs are real or not?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. Did they address after releasing the files, or they just gave you paper and you had to shift through them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. I know we didn't get to meet one again, but did they say one way or the other, whether UFOs are real or that extraterrestrial is a real phenomenon?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. Well, I mean, the problem is that the files they released are sort of the mundane files, like grants at the siting files, or they're very old, historical files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. Siting files means that they cited something somewhere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. Correct, but what we would want to see is some kind of conclusion, and those kind of documents seem to be- They were not included.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. I mean, there are some conclusions, for instance, in the Condon Report, which was this famous project by the University of Colorado, but that was distorted, too, because they wanted to close Blue Book.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. Now, some of the case histories in the Condon Report are valid, and actually about 30 percent of the case histories in the Condon Report are unexplained.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. That's how much you will find in the U.S. files, that there are a certain percentage of cases that are unexplained.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. So how would you sum what they've released, and do you know of a U.S. ... Can we conclude a position from our government on this issue, based on what they've released with CIA or FBI?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. The truth is, it's confusing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. I mean, some people, like there is Colonel John Alexander.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. He was involved in some study at the Pentagon in the 1980s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. So this would have been much, much later, when there wasn't Blue Book, all that was old history, and he claims it was not a formal project in the sense that they had to issue reports and things, but it was obviously tolerated by his superiors, and they went around and they briefed a number of people, including high-level people, like admirals and generals and General Abramson, the head of the Star Wars SDI project, and people like that, very high-level people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. And he wrote a book about this, so I'm not revealing anything that is unknown.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. So they would brief these people, because this group of scientists that all had clearances and were working within the Pentagon on the military-industrial complex, would brief these generals and staff, because they thought that there was some kind of big project going on, according to Alexander.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. And then what would happen, if you read his book, is that most of these generals or admirals say, "No, we don't have anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. I mean, we have no project."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. So that was the official record, but he tells in his book some anecdotes that then after the official meeting was over, then the admiral will come and whisper to him, "But let me tell you about my sighting."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. So this is the kind of stuff you encounter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. That's kind of soft, but there was something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. There was something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. It was something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. Mr. Cameron, thank you very much, Mr. Honest.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. You said, Mr. Cameron, that we were waiting for America to make the first move.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. What move would that be?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. What do you speak when you say that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. The move to disclosure, to identifying the fact that it's an ET phenomena or whatever it is, I have heard stories from other governments, sort of off the record, they were asked, "Will you disclose?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. And they said, "As soon as the Americans disclose, we'll be a close second."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. I've heard stories like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. That's where I think the American sort of, especially when it comes to NATO, if you take a look at the NATO thing, America is basically the main thing in NATO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. Everybody sort of takes their lead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. They have a lot of power.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. I think it's the same thing in this field that ...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. So the world is waiting for the US to say yay or nay on UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. Or set the policy or determine ...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. Or set the policy?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. Set ... Well, the policy is basically sort of being set by the Americans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. I thought the Americans hadn't done much on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. Well, I mean, as I say, I think they've disclosed stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. They have ... I mean, and they have disclosed a lot of documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. I mean, if you get to documents ...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. You said that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. The United States Library has disclosed thousands of pages of documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. And so, I mean, there are documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. It's the official conclusions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. It's the official ...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. There are no conclusions from the documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. Yeah, like the real top secret documents you won't find no matter what country you go to.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. And our country has not concluded ...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. It's still on the position that there's nothing to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. And every other government, I think, goes by that and takes the same position.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. That is a position.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. If you said they've released the files under court order, CIA and FBI ...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. Under FOIA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. There's a lot under FOIA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. Under FOIA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. And they also sued them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. It's, you know, 1977.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. So, they have concluded.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. They released some, and they've concluded there is none.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. That's their official conclusion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. That's good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

484. Dr. Sun Shili, I'd like to spend the rest of my time with you just a bit before I yield back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. Tell me about the Chinese UFO Federation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. Is it an NGO unrelated to the government?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. What is its mission?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. It is an NGO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. This is a private NGO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. What is the work of the federation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

492. Our mission is that in the field of UFO, we conduct scientific research, and in recent years, what the senator has asked, we have conducted many scientific research.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. To give you an example, that I have in the conference, in the Marino, there was a General Corso, a Colonel Corso.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. He is also a very famous expert on the Roswell case, and he worked in the Department of Defense Pentagon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. And after, he said that he embraced me and hugged me, and then he gave me a book on the Roswell, and he says that for Professor Sun, my greatest friend, I believe that a person like you will help everybody to create a new world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. This was from a former Pentagon official who was so excited after learning about our scientific research results.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. Now, we have a technology to turn water into anything, into fuel, into food, turning stone into food and into food.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. We are researching on these new technologies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

499. We have many new things, new scientific research like this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

500. We're now trying to find where aliens come from so that we can be inspired by them in the scientific area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. But when saying that, we do have some scientific research and results in some particular areas already.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

502. So why did I say that we all have this nature to find our roots?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

503. I think that's in our DNA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. The other one that you are very much involved in is the China UFO Research Institute established in 1980.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. What is it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. How does it work?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. What is its mission?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

508. Yes, the mission for this institute is to explore UFO issues scientifically.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

509. We go to conferences and we also are interviewed constantly by international as well as domestic media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. As I mentioned, the AP, CNN, BBC, this institute has been interviewed by all these media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. And personally, I have been interviewed many, many times too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. So actually, there are two faults.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. People who are engaged in these institutes, first, they are personally very interested in this topic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. And also we have experts who are experts in areas such as how to make airplanes and astronomy and science.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. These experts use their expertise to do research.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. That is why this institute has been commended by the society.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. Originally, some people think that this is just for chit chat, but we have elevated this topic, this issue, onto a higher level where we talk about how learning about UFOs, learning about aliens, can help us solve environmental problems and health problems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

518. And is the Federation or the institute located in any other countries outside of China?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. Do you have branches anywhere else in the world?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

520. Yes, we do have branches outside of China.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. And other places, and they are not necessarily called an institute or a federation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. They are called maybe called a UFO club or association.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. So through these branches, we can collaborate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. In fact, we are interacting with aliens already.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. They carry on the missions of both of the federation and of the institute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. Question?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

527. Yes, they do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

528. They carry on the programs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

530. Similar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. Particularly, we have a World Chinese UFO federation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. I'm the chairman for that federation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. So how are the institute and the federation funded?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. How do you operate?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. I've got a minute left and you've got it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. How are you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. How do you carry on your program?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. How are you funded?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

539. Well, about funding, we are purely a private NGO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. So well, the government is very busy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. They don't have time to take care of us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

542. So well, symbolically, they give us very little funding.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. So I have a very, very tough job.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. Because I have to think about how this federation and how this institute can survive.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

545. I have to find the funding.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

546. Some scientists and inventors have to prove that their research is viable, and that's my job.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. I have to let people know that what we're doing is viable so that we can find enough funding.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. I know that it's very difficult.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. I'd like to know if any of you could tell us, the panel, whether in any of the disclosures you're aware of from government entities or from non-government, well, it would have to be government entities, obviously, or from the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. It doesn't have to be your government, your country, any government, where gun, camera, footage, or files on analysis of materials have ever been released.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. Go ahead, Mr. Pope.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

552. The United Kingdom certainly did have some cases where military jets were sent up to intercept UFOs being tracked on radars.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. Similar to the Peru incident that we talked about this morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

554. Correct, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

555. Okay, go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

556. If some gun, camera, footage was taken, and certainly I'm aware of on-the-record testimony from former MOD officials saying they've seen it, to the best of my knowledge, none of that material has survived, and I've not seen it personally, but it certainly existed at MOD.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

557. So it's not released, but you know it exists?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

558. It existed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

559. I believe it's lost or destroyed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

561. Can I ask this final, if I have 30 seconds, is anybody aware of a, well let me get this question in please, anybody, is anybody aware of a military person or a contractor for the military that's been released from a secrecy oath that they might have taken on the subject of UFOs from any country, again, your own or the U.S. or any other country?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

562. In the case of Italy, we had in San Marino in 2000, the chief of the Reparto Generale Sicurezza of the Italian Air Force who came in uniform to have a presentation of the UFO data, of the official UFO data, in the San Marino Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

563. This man today is retired and would have been here if possible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

564. He did not come because he told me he signed a sort of security statement for 20 years not to speak on these subjects, even if, after all, what he said in San Marino in 2000 is open, and this is curious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

565. Anybody else?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

566. I can give you just a quick example I mentioned, I think, in my testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

567. Dick DiMatto, who worked for Senator Byrd, was given authorization to go to Area 51 to see if they're spending money on flying saucers and Aurora and all this kind of stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. He met with Alfred O'Donnell.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. He offered him complete clearance from any sort of security oaths he had taken, and O'Donnell refused to talk.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

570. But Dick DiMatto did make that offer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

571. So there's been an offer?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

572. There was an offer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

573. He refused to talk.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

574. We're out of time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

575. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

576. We're out of time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

577. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
