## Speaker Group 1

321. I would like to address -- first of all, I have a question for all of you, but following on, a colleague was just saying, what is the reaction of your government towards the transparency of this whole subject?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. As we know, the U.S. is very deficient, and probably the highest standard we've run across thus far is Uruguay, where it's so transparent that they even go to the effort to educate people in school with Air Force personnel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. In China, is the government transparent about this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. Is there an official position in that regard?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. What's your government position?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. Let me begin first, then.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. Our government, my government, in a lot of international conferences, a lot of media workers have asked me about these questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. My answer is this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. This is to be open and to be objective and be pragmatic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. And another thing is that being cautious, that is very -- this is a very -- the position is that to be cautious, where the reason that we need to open up is because China is going through the opening up and transparent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. So under this kind of circumstance, we can talk about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. And also, the government is not very strict about keeping everything secret.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. For example, in the Air Force, that they have the combat with the UFO, and that we have interview on all those of the stories, and they told us truthfully of their encounter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. And sometimes the militaries, when they don't understand of some certain situations, they even come to us, they consult us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. So we will try to relay some of the information on UFO to them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. And, however, we still be very cautious and vigilant as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. They don't want to take a non-scientific way of approach of studying UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. They don't want to mix with anything that is not scientific.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. So they don't want any distractions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. If only a purely a UFO incident or an ET incident, and the government will not interfere with any investigation, that would give us a more lax situation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. That's commendable on the part of your government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. I just have one general question, and I apologize for excusing myself earlier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. Is anybody familiar with Dr. Wood, a woman, PhD on directed energy?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. She has written extensively about the use of directed energy to bring down the Twin Towers on 9/11.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. Are any of you, or maybe this is a question for the scientific panel tomorrow, or certainly my colleague here, but has any of you run across the issue of directed energy with respect to the UFO or the energy that obviously they possess that we don't understand for propulsion?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. And I would start with my colleague from Italy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. A consideration may be done in the case of unidentified submerged objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. As far as we know, when they are in the hydrosphere, these objects, well, they do not are in direct contact with the water.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. It seems that they are covered by a sort of pillow of energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. And this prevents any contact with the shell, you understand, with the hull.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. And probably what Antonio Neus said before is to be connected with this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. It's the same kind probably of propulsion mean, a sort of electromagnetic propulsion which permits these objects to move in any kind of environment, deep space without any kind of atmosphere, like our astronauts said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. Any kind of atmosphere, ours or any other planet's.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. And of course, also a more dense environment like water.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. So as far as we know, probably there is a definite pattern in all this, in the possibility of an electromagnetic and anti-gravity system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. Frankly, we still have to learn a lot about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. Any other comments on that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. Senator, yes, and with apologies for not having printed this off for the committee, but it was 468 pages, I can supply a hyperlink.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. We accept that apology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. Though the Ministry of Defence were talking about the possibility that some UFOs were exotic plasmas, three sentences might be directly relevant to your question from Project Condign's final report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. It says, "There is evidence from openly published scientific papers that scientists in the former Soviet Union have taken a particular interest in UFO phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. They have identified the close connection with plasma technologies and are pursuing related technologies for potential military purposes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. For example, very high-power energy generation, RF weapons, impulse radars, air vehicle drag and radar signature reduction or control, and possibly for radar-reflecting decoys."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. Antonio, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. Yes, Senator.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. I just wanted to add that one of the first people that looked at the propulsion systems of UFOs was one of the most qualified persons because it was Professor Hermann Oberth, who was one of the fathers of the Space Age.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. As you know, the Space Age has three fathers, Tsiolkovsky in Russia, Robert Goddard in the United States, and Oberth in Germany.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. He was the mentor of von Braun, and he later worked for us too, like many of the German scientists from Operation Paperclip and that whole episode.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. But Oberth in the '50s became very interested in ufology, so one of the guys that invented rocket.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. He wrote the classic book about the rocket into interplanetary space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. This was published in German in 1922, a long time before the Nazis, and so it was a brilliant man.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. I'm honored that I met him when he was like something like 96 years old.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. I didn't speak German, so I cannot say that I interviewed him, but at least I had the pleasure of meeting one of the fathers of the Space Age.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. I had to go to his house near Nuremberg.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. But he had wrote some papers, some articles, and obviously he was eminently qualified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. The technical things I would have to look in my notes, so I don't want to speculate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. One of the things he had to say, though, is because of the maneuverability, the change of course and 90-degree changes, turns, and things like that, the pilots or whoever beings were inside these objects had to be shielded from the rest of it, otherwise they would be crushed to death, he said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. These were some papers he wrote in the 1950s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Actually in the Rockefeller briefing document that I co-authored, in the quotation section we do have some key quotes from Herman Oberth, but if you're interested I can get you some other articles that he published about this subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. There's another American scientist who used to work for NASA, Paul Hill, I believe was his name, who wrote a book after his death, I think his daughter had found these notes or whatever, and it was called "Unconventional Flying Objects."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. That's a pretty serious, sober, highly technical discussion of propulsion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. So there's been many people that, well, not many, but there've been a few qualified people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. There are some other not qualified, I would disregard those, but at least there are a few.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. There was another German who used a pseudonym, Ross Sigma, who wrote and published a book called "Ether Technologies."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. That was not his real name.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. I think his real name was Schneider Franken or something like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. I think he had maybe worked in Peenemünde also, Gordon Cooper, the astronaut Gordon Cooper knew him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. Gordon Cooper was very, very much interested in the UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. So yeah, there are several leads, although I'm sure that there are plenty more, but that would be classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. Great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. Madam Chairman, I reserve the time or share the time with anybody who wants to use it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. Congresswoman Kilpatrick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
