## Speaker Group 1

321. I would like to address -- first of all, I have a question for all of you, but following on, a colleague was just saying, what is the reaction of your government towards the transparency of this whole subject?
→ {"text": "我想先提出一個問題——首先，我要問各位，接續剛才同事的發言，你們各自的政府對於這整個議題的透明度有何反應？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

322. As we know, the U.S. is very deficient, and probably the highest standard we've run across thus far is Uruguay, where it's so transparent that they even go to the effort to educate people in school with Air Force personnel.
→ {"text": "如我們所知，美國在這方面非常不足，而我們迄今遇到的最高標準可能是烏拉圭，那裡的透明度極高，他們甚至還動用空軍人員在學校教育民眾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

323. In China, is the government transparent about this?
→ {"text": "在中國，政府對此是否透明？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

324. Is there an official position in that regard?
→ {"text": "在這方面是否有官方立場？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

325. What's your government position?
→ {"text": "你們政府的立場是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

326. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

327. Let me begin first, then.
→ {"text": "那麼，讓我先開始回答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. Our government, my government, in a lot of international conferences, a lot of media workers have asked me about these questions.
→ {"text": "我們的政府，在許多國際會議上，許多媒體工作者都問過我這些問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

329. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

330. My answer is this.
→ {"text": "我的答案是這樣的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

331. This is to be open and to be objective and be pragmatic.
→ {"text": "要保持開放、客觀並務實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. And another thing is that being cautious, that is very -- this is a very -- the position is that to be cautious, where the reason that we need to open up is because China is going through the opening up and transparent.
→ {"text": "另外一點是要謹慎，這是非常——這是一個非常——立場是要謹慎，我們需要開放的原因是因為中國正在經歷開放與透明化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. So under this kind of circumstance, we can talk about this.
→ {"text": "所以在這種情況下，我們可以談論這個議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

334. And also, the government is not very strict about keeping everything secret.
→ {"text": "而且，政府對於保密也不是非常嚴格。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

335. For example, in the Air Force, that they have the combat with the UFO, and that we have interview on all those of the stories, and they told us truthfully of their encounter.
→ {"text": "例如，在空軍中，他們曾與不明飛行物交戰，我們訪問了所有這些故事的當事人，他們如實告訴我們他們的遭遇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

336. And sometimes the militaries, when they don't understand of some certain situations, they even come to us, they consult us.
→ {"text": "有時候軍方在不理解某些情況時，他們甚至會來找我們諮詢。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

337. So we will try to relay some of the information on UFO to them.
→ {"text": "所以我們會試著向他們傳達一些關於不明飛行物的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. And, however, we still be very cautious and vigilant as well.
→ {"text": "然而，我們仍然非常謹慎和警惕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. They don't want to take a non-scientific way of approach of studying UFO.
→ {"text": "他們不想以非科學的方式來研究不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

340. They don't want to mix with anything that is not scientific.
→ {"text": "他們不想摻雜任何非科學的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

341. So they don't want any distractions.
→ {"text": "所以他們不想要任何干擾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

342. If only a purely a UFO incident or an ET incident, and the government will not interfere with any investigation, that would give us a more lax situation.
→ {"text": "如果僅僅是純粹的不明飛行物事件或外星人事件，政府不會干預任何調查，這會給我們一個更寬鬆的環境。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

343. That's commendable on the part of your government.
→ {"text": "你們政府這樣做值得讚許。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

344. I just have one general question, and I apologize for excusing myself earlier.
→ {"text": "我只有一個普遍性的問題，我要為稍早離席致歉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

345. Is anybody familiar with Dr. Wood, a woman, PhD on directed energy?
→ {"text": "有人熟悉伍德博士嗎？一位研究定向能武器的女性博士？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

346. She has written extensively about the use of directed energy to bring down the Twin Towers on 9/11.
→ {"text": "她撰寫了大量關於使用定向能武器摧毀九一一雙子塔的文章。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

347. Are any of you, or maybe this is a question for the scientific panel tomorrow, or certainly my colleague here, but has any of you run across the issue of directed energy with respect to the UFO or the energy that obviously they possess that we don't understand for propulsion?
→ {"text": "你們當中有人，或許這是明天科學專家小組的問題，或是在座的同事，但你們有人遇過關於定向能武器與不明飛行物的問題嗎？或者說他們顯然擁有我們不理解的能量用於推進？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

348. And I would start with my colleague from Italy.
→ {"text": "我想先從義大利的同事開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

349. A consideration may be done in the case of unidentified submerged objects.
→ {"text": "可以從不明潛水物體（USO）的案例來思考。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

350. As far as we know, when they are in the hydrosphere, these objects, well, they do not are in direct contact with the water.
→ {"text": "據我們所知，當這些物體在水圈中時，它們並未直接接觸水。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

351. It seems that they are covered by a sort of pillow of energy.
→ {"text": "它們似乎被某種能量護墊包覆著。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

352. And this prevents any contact with the shell, you understand, with the hull.
→ {"text": "這防止了與外殼的任何接觸，你知道的，與船體的接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. And probably what Antonio Neus said before is to be connected with this.
→ {"text": "而且可能如安東尼奧·胡內斯之前所說的，這與此有關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

354. It's the same kind probably of propulsion mean, a sort of electromagnetic propulsion which permits these objects to move in any kind of environment, deep space without any kind of atmosphere, like our astronauts said.
→ {"text": "這可能是同一種推進方式，某種電磁推進，使這些物體能在任何環境中移動，就像我們的太空人所說的，在沒有任何大氣的深空中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

355. Any kind of atmosphere, ours or any other planet's.
→ {"text": "任何種類的大氣層，我們的或任何其他星球的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

356. And of course, also a more dense environment like water.
→ {"text": "當然，也包括像水這樣更密集的環境。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

357. So as far as we know, probably there is a definite pattern in all this, in the possibility of an electromagnetic and anti-gravity system.
→ {"text": "所以據我們所知，在所有這些現象中可能存在一個明確的模式，即電磁和反重力系統的可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

358. Frankly, we still have to learn a lot about this.
→ {"text": "坦白說，我們對此還有很多要學習的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

359. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

360. Any other comments on that?
→ {"text": "對此還有其他意見嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

361. Senator, yes, and with apologies for not having printed this off for the committee, but it was 468 pages, I can supply a hyperlink.
→ {"text": "參議員，是的，我要為沒有列印給委員會致歉，但那有468頁，我可以提供超連結。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

362. We accept that apology.
→ {"text": "我們接受這個道歉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

363. Though the Ministry of Defence were talking about the possibility that some UFOs were exotic plasmas, three sentences might be directly relevant to your question from Project Condign's final report.
→ {"text": "儘管國防部談論某些不明飛行物可能是奇特電漿的可能性，康丁計畫（Project Condign）最終報告中有三句話可能與您的問題直接相關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "修正轉錄錯誤：Project Condine → Project Condign"}

364. It says, "There is evidence from openly published scientific papers that scientists in the former Soviet Union have taken a particular interest in UFO phenomena.
→ {"text": "報告中寫道：「有證據顯示，根據公開發表的科學論文，前蘇聯的科學家對不明飛行物現象特別感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

365. They have identified the close connection with plasma technologies and are pursuing related technologies for potential military purposes.
→ {"text": "他們已經確認了與電漿技術的密切聯繫，並正在為潛在的軍事目的追求相關技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

366. For example, very high-power energy generation, RF weapons, impulse radars, air vehicle drag and radar signature reduction or control, and possibly for radar-reflecting decoys."
→ {"text": "例如，超高功率能量產生、射頻武器、脈衝雷達、飛行器阻力和雷達特徵減少或控制，以及可能用於雷達反射誘餌。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

367. Antonio, please.
→ {"text": "安東尼奧，請。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

368. Yes, Senator.
→ {"text": "是的，參議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. I just wanted to add that one of the first people that looked at the propulsion systems of UFOs was one of the most qualified persons because it was Professor Hermann Oberth, who was one of the fathers of the Space Age.
→ {"text": "我只想補充，最早研究不明飛行物推進系統的人之一是最有資格的人之一，因為他是赫爾曼·奧伯特教授（Professor Hermann Oberth），太空時代之父之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. As you know, the Space Age has three fathers, Tsiolkovsky in Russia, Robert Goddard in the United States, and Oberth in Germany.
→ {"text": "如你所知，太空時代有三位之父，俄羅斯的齊奧爾科夫斯基（Tsiolkovsky）、美國的羅伯特·戈達德（Robert Goddard），以及德國的奧伯特（Oberth）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. He was the mentor of von Braun, and he later worked for us too, like many of the German scientists from Operation Paperclip and that whole episode.
→ {"text": "他是馮·布朗（von Braun）的導師，後來也為我們工作，就像迴紋針行動（Operation Paperclip）中的許多德國科學家一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. But Oberth in the '50s became very interested in ufology, so one of the guys that invented rocket.
→ {"text": "但奧伯特在1950年代對幽浮學非常感興趣，所以發明火箭的人之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

373. He wrote the classic book about the rocket into interplanetary space.
→ {"text": "他寫了關於火箭進入星際空間的經典著作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

374. This was published in German in 1922, a long time before the Nazis, and so it was a brilliant man.
→ {"text": "這本書於1922年以德文出版，遠在納粹之前，所以他是個才華洋溢的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

375. I'm honored that I met him when he was like something like 96 years old.
→ {"text": "我很榮幸在他大約96歲時見過他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. I didn't speak German, so I cannot say that I interviewed him, but at least I had the pleasure of meeting one of the fathers of the Space Age.
→ {"text": "我不會說德語，所以我不能說我訪問了他，但至少我有幸見到太空時代之父之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. I had to go to his house near Nuremberg.
→ {"text": "我去了他在紐倫堡附近的家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

378. But he had wrote some papers, some articles, and obviously he was eminently qualified.
→ {"text": "但他寫了一些論文和文章，顯然他極具資格。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. The technical things I would have to look in my notes, so I don't want to speculate.
→ {"text": "技術細節我需要查看我的筆記，所以我不想推測。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. One of the things he had to say, though, is because of the maneuverability, the change of course and 90-degree changes, turns, and things like that, the pilots or whoever beings were inside these objects had to be shielded from the rest of it, otherwise they would be crushed to death, he said.
→ {"text": "不過，他提到的一點是，由於這些物體的機動性、航向改變和90度轉彎等，駕駛員或任何在這些物體內的生物必須被屏蔽，否則他們會被壓死，他說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

381. These were some papers he wrote in the 1950s.
→ {"text": "這些是他在1950年代寫的一些論文。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

382. Actually in the Rockefeller briefing document that I co-authored, in the quotation section we do have some key quotes from Herman Oberth, but if you're interested I can get you some other articles that he published about this subject.
→ {"text": "實際上在我共同撰寫的洛克菲勒簡報文件中，引言部分確實有赫爾曼·奧伯特的一些關鍵引述，如果您有興趣，我可以提供他發表的其他相關文章。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

383. There's another American scientist who used to work for NASA, Paul Hill, I believe was his name, who wrote a book after his death, I think his daughter had found these notes or whatever, and it was called "Unconventional Flying Objects."
→ {"text": "還有另一位曾為NASA工作的美國科學家，我相信他叫保羅·希爾（Paul Hill），他去世後出版了一本書，我想是他女兒找到了這些筆記或什麼的，書名叫《非常規飛行物體》（Unconventional Flying Objects）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "修正轉錄錯誤：Conventional → Unconventional"}

384. That's a pretty serious, sober, highly technical discussion of propulsion.
→ {"text": "那是一個相當嚴肅、冷靜、高度技術性的推進系統討論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

385. So there's been many people that, well, not many, but there've been a few qualified people.
→ {"text": "所以有很多人，嗯，不是很多，但有一些有資格的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

386. There are some other not qualified, I would disregard those, but at least there are a few.
→ {"text": "還有一些不夠格的，我會忽略那些，但至少有一些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. There was another German who used a pseudonym, Ross Sigma, who wrote and published a book called "Ether Technologies."
→ {"text": "還有另一位德國人使用筆名羅斯·西格瑪（Rho Sigma），他撰寫並出版了一本名為《以太技術》（Ether Technologies）的書。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. That was not his real name.
→ {"text": "那不是他的真名。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. I think his real name was Schneider Franken or something like that.
→ {"text": "我想他的真名是施奈德·法蘭肯（Schneider Franken）或類似的名字。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. I think he had maybe worked in Peenemünde also, Gordon Cooper, the astronaut Gordon Cooper knew him.
→ {"text": "我想他可能也在佩訥明德（Peenemünde）工作過，太空人戈登·庫伯（Gordon Cooper）認識他。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "修正轉錄錯誤：Penemunde → Peenemünde"}

391. Gordon Cooper was very, very much interested in the UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "戈登·庫伯對不明飛行物現象非常非常感興趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. So yeah, there are several leads, although I'm sure that there are plenty more, but that would be classified.
→ {"text": "所以是的，有幾個線索，雖然我確信還有更多，但那些可能是機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. Great.
→ {"text": "很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
