## Speaker Group 1

79. Dr. Bartlett.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. Mr. Cameron, you mentioned mental phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. Is that related to an interest in consciousness?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. Could you explain a bit?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. Let me give you the examples.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. I only figured this out a year ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. I've known about the top-secret memo and the reference to mental phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. Later when it occurred to me what had happened, as I mentioned in my testimony, we ran across Dr. Eric Walker, who was the former president of Penn State University.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

89. And during the conversations interviewers were having with him, they were pressing him on MJ-12, who runs the cover-up, is it all Americans, is it more than 12 people?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. And Walker cut him off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

91. This is 1991, 41 years later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. Walker cuts him off and says, "Let me ask you a question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. What do you know about ESP?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. The interviewer from Britain had no idea what to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. Walker answered his own question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. He said, "Look, unless you understand about ESP and how it works, you will not be taken in."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. He's referring to the control group.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. Very few people understand it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. Then two years later, Ben Rich, who ran Lockheed Skunk Works, and I can remind the Congress that you guys funded all these operations, the U-2, the SR-71, the stealth fighter, the stealth bomber, the drones.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. This guy ran Lockheed Skunk Works in 1993.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. He's giving a lecture to the UCLA engineering alumni.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. And he stands up, and the last slide that he shows is a flying saucer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. And he says, "We now have the technology to take ET home.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. We've discovered the mistake in the equation, and it's going to take an act of God to get this thing out of Congress because it's so deep black."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. Two of the people in the room were UFO researchers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. They chased them out of the room, realizing this was a significant point in history.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. And they said to him, "Mr. Rich, you said you've discovered the mistake in the equation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. What are you talking about?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. We're interested in UFO propulsion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. How does it work?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. And just like the Canadians in 1950, just like 1991, Eric Walker, Rich turns around and says to him, "Let me ask you a question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. What do you know about ESP?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. One guy says, "That just means everything in time and space is connected."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. He said, "That's how it works."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. Mr. Pope, you mentioned air safety issues.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. With the maneuverability of these craft, do you mean that we're concerned that they would be hostile or they'd accidentally run into us or vice versa?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. Well, sir, it's the possibility of a collision between a commercial or military aircraft and whatever these UFOs might turn out to be.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. That was the concern.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. And I mentioned that there are on case file a number of near misses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. Indeed, I believe a new case was publicized in mainstream media just two days ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. But there had never been a collision?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. Not in the UK, sir, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. And I mean, a couple of near misses that were close enough that the pilot flinched and called on one occasion, "Look out, look out," but no collision.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. Thank goodness, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. You mentioned electromagnetic propulsion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. Does that include antigravity?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. I don't know, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. That was it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. You mentioned that in his report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. You mentioned electromagnetic propulsion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. That was in the French report about the Trans-en-Provence case, yes, and I think they had found it if they can show the slide of the Rockefeller from the briefing document.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. That was in their conclusions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. That's the one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. Conclusion, I probably cannot read it too well from here, but yeah, there you go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. So this is the landing case in the farmers' field in Trans Improvance in 1981.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. Conclusion, physical phenomenon unexplained nature, high probability of electromagnetic mode of propulsion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. And this is an official chart from the French Space Agency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. So that's their conclusion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. Also, since you had asked about the near collision, I might as well add that that's, as I explained in this morning's testimony, that again was one of the main reasons of the Chilean committee, the CEFA, to ensure air safety operations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. That's part of their mission.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. And in their files that they have released in the radio pilot communications, they have also a couple of cases of near collision, which you can actually hear because they posted the audio tapes on their website.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. There was a case in Puerto Montt in the south of Chile in 1988 where you can literally hear – it's in Spanish, of course, because it's in Chile – you can literally hear the pilot freaking out because this object unexplained, he's called it control tower saying, "What is that object?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Do you have traffic?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. The control tower gets back to him, "No, we have no scheduled traffic."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. He said, "Well, this thing is almost about to crash with me."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. And then the people at the control tower, this object hovers near the airport, and so it was seen from the ground, not just by the pilots.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. Then the personnel at the airport was able to see this object hovering over the airport.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. And of course, there was not a near collision, but there was a famous similar case at the O'Hare Airport in Chicago in 2006, I believe it was, which was quite significant, seen near the American Airlines terminal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. And it only leaked out because I think it was the Chicago Tribune got wind of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. But the FAA never made any kind of official investigation or comment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. So that is a problem that, regardless of what UFOs are, regardless of their origin, yes, it can pose a threat.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. And then General Bermudez, the head of the committee in Chile, also made another point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. He says, "Even if it's not an immediate near collision, the pilot might get distracted because he's seeing something that is not supposed to be there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. So it's maybe that he's not going to crash with the airplane, but instead of concentrating on flying his airplane, he's being distracted by an unknown object that is somehow getting near him."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. So these are among the reasons that this subject should be investigated by the civil aviation agencies, which of course Chile is doing, but it should be done in other countries as well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. The story this morning of the pilot chasing this UFO, I think I heard that in spite of how big it was and how obvious it was, there was no radar track?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. I don't...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. I think that's what I remember here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. Yeah, I'm not sure of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. But I might as well add, there are another very significant case which happened in Iran in 1976, which again was revealed by American Defense Attaché documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. That's how the case became public, very famous case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. The pilot at the time was a captain, eventually became a major general in the Iranian Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. In fact, he came and testified at a previous symposium here at the National Press Club.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. He was the pilot that...same thing, this huge UFO object was flying over Tehran.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. This was in the days of the Shah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. So the US had very good relations, as you know, with Iran, and that's how they got all the reports.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. But the difference there is that as he was instructed, again, to fire at this object because the object was not responding, was not identifying itself, suddenly all his weapons control panel was jammed and he could not fire.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. The thing wasn't working.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. The electromagnetic communication, the radio, everything was malfunction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. This was an F-4 Phantom jet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. And then, according to this pilot, who later became a general, he said that from the UFO, like a little object came, like the UFO was responding, that's as close as an actual combat between a UFO and it's all documented by the US government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. There was even an evaluation by the Defense Intelligence Agency, which was later declassified, that call it an outstanding UFO report because it validated the existence of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. This in the words of our own government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. And they list all the reasons why, because it was multiple witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. Some of the witnesses were very high ranking generals.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. Two airplanes had been scrambled.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. One of them had the malfunctions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. So this is real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. Now, where did that UFO came from and what was its purpose?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. We don't know that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. But that the object was real, there's no question about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. If it's true that these things can deflect bullets and not be affected, then somehow they might be able to absorb radar and have no reflection?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. Well, for many years, researchers in ufology have known this and it's referred as the electromagnetic effect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. There are many cases involving cars.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. With airplanes, it's more worrisome because a car can stop in the middle of a close encounter and nothing will happen except inconvenience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. But if you're flying an airplane and your electrical system, you know, your engine stalls, you're in trouble.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. But with airplanes, it's not as common, but there have been cases, although not crashes or perhaps.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. But I mean, I'm not right now aware of crashes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. But with cars, it's fairly common.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. And this was referred, even in the '50s, as the electromagnetic effect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. It is assumed that the UFO is emitting a field of energy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. And this field of energy then will interfere with electrical systems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. And even blackouts have been, in many cases, of power blackouts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. Even the major blackouts, even in the United States, there were reports of UFO sightings near the power station where the blackout was triggered.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. There was, as a matter of fact, in Argentina, a case in 2009, which made some headlines, where there was a blackout in a town called Joaquin Gonzales in some province in Argentina right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. I forgot which one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. And well, most people just, you know, had a power blackout, and then they saw this cigar-shaped object hovering over the city.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. But there was a reservoir with a power dam nearby.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. And one of the witnesses was fishing, because people go there for recreational fishing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. And one of the witnesses said that he saw this disk hovering over one of the transformers, and there was, like, an exchange of energy between the UFO and the transformer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. And as this energy exchange was happening, boom, there was kind of like a flash, and then the whole area went dark.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. So there is definitely an electromagnetic effect, but it needs to be studied more at depth for which we need resources to do so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. Is there any—what are the suggestions as to what the energy source is that these craft use?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. Well, I'm not really an engineer, you know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. I mean, I'm a science reporter, so I can give you a general idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. But they will have—I think tomorrow there was a session about technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. Did it happen already?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. I forgot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. Tomorrow?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. Yeah, tomorrow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. Tomorrow there is a session of technology, where you will have people that would be more qualified than me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. There's been—I mean, all these terms, anti-gravity and things like that have been used, you know, but you better get a response from someone more qualified than me for the technical—for the real technical details.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. But I can give you just a general idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. My time is up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
