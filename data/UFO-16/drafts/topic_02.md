123. Not in the UK, sir, no.
→ {"text": "在英國沒有，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. And I mean, a couple of near misses that were close enough that the pilot flinched and called on one occasion, "Look out, look out," but no collision.
→ {"text": "我是說，有幾次險些相撞的距離近到足以讓飛行員驚嚇，有一次還大喊「小心，小心」，但沒有發生碰撞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

125. Thank goodness, yeah.

→ {"text": "您在他的報告中提到了這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. You mentioned electromagnetic propulsion.
→ {"text": "您提到了電磁推進。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. That was in the French report about the Trans-en-Provence case, yes, and I think they had found it if they can show the slide of the Rockefeller from the briefing document.
→ {"text": "是的，這是在法國關於特朗桑普羅旺斯案（Trans-en-Provence case）的報告中提到的，如果他們能展示洛克菲勒簡報文件中的投影片，我想他們已經找到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 Trans Improvance 為轉錄錯誤，正確為 Trans-en-Provence，依照 topics.json potential_errors 修正"}

138. And this is an official chart from the French Space Agency.
→ {"text": "這是法國太空總署的官方圖表。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. So that's their conclusion.
→ {"text": "這就是他們的結論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. Also, since you had asked about the near collision, I might as well add that that's, as I explained in this morning's testimony, that again was one of the main reasons of the Chilean committee, the CEFA, to ensure air safety operations.
→ {"text": "另外，既然您問到了險些相撞的問題，我不妨補充一點，正如我在今天上午的證詞中所解釋的，這正是智利空中現象研究委員會（CEFA）成立的主要原因之一——確保航空安全作業。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "CEFA 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「智利空中現象研究委員會（CEFA）」"}

141. That's part of their mission.
→ {"text": "這是他們任務的一部分。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. And in their files that they have released in the radio pilot communications, they have also a couple of cases of near collision, which you can actually hear because they posted the audio tapes on their website.
→ {"text": "在他們公開的飛行員無線電通訊檔案中，也有幾起險些相撞的案例，您實際上可以聽到錄音，因為他們在網站上公布了音檔。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. There was a case in Puerto Montt in the south of Chile in 1988 where you can literally hear – it's in Spanish, of course, because it's in Chile – you can literally hear the pilot freaking out because this object unexplained, he's called it control tower saying, "What is that object?
→ {"text": "1988 年在智利南部蒙特港（Puerto Montt）發生了一起案例，您可以清楚地聽到——當然是西班牙語，因為是在智利——您可以清楚地聽到飛行員因為這個無法解釋的物體而驚慌失措，他呼叫塔台說：「那是什麼物體？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Puerto Montt 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「蒙特港」"}

144. Do you have traffic?"
→ {"text": "你們有其他航班嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": "traffic 在航空術語中指其他飛行器"}

145. The control tower gets back to him, "No, we have no scheduled traffic."
→ {"text": "塔台回覆他：「沒有，我們沒有預定的航班。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. He said, "Well, this thing is almost about to crash with me."
→ {"text": "他說：「這東西快要撞上我了。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. And then the people at the control tower, this object hovers near the airport, and so it was seen from the ground, not just by the pilots.
→ {"text": "然後塔台的人員發現，這個物體在機場附近盤旋，所以不僅飛行員看到了，地面人員也看到了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. Then the personnel at the airport was able to see this object hovering over the airport.
→ {"text": "機場人員能夠看到這個物體在機場上方盤旋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. And of course, there was not a near collision, but there was a famous similar case at the O'Hare Airport in Chicago in 2006, I believe it was, which was quite significant, seen near the American Airlines terminal.
→ {"text": "當然，那次並非險些相撞，但 2006 年芝加哥歐海爾機場（O'Hare Airport）也有一起類似的著名案例，我記得是那一年，相當重要，在美國航空的航廈附近目擊到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 O'Hara 為轉錄錯誤，正確為 O'Hare Airport，依照 topics.json potential_errors 修正"}

150. And it only leaked out because I think it was the Chicago Tribune got wind of it.
→ {"text": "這件事之所以洩露出來，是因為我想是《芝加哥論壇報》得到了消息。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. But the FAA never made any kind of official investigation or comment.
→ {"text": "但美國聯邦航空總署（FAA）從未進行任何官方調查或評論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "FAA 首次出現，加註全名"}

152. So that is a problem that, regardless of what UFOs are, regardless of their origin, yes, it can pose a threat.
→ {"text": "所以這是個問題，無論 UFO 是什麼、無論其來源為何，是的，它們可能構成威脅。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. And then General Bermudez, the head of the committee in Chile, also made another point.
→ {"text": "智利委員會負責人貝穆德斯將軍（General Bermudez）還提出了另一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. He says, "Even if it's not an immediate near collision, the pilot might get distracted because he's seeing something that is not supposed to be there.
→ {"text": "他說：「即使不是立即的險些相撞，飛行員也可能因為看到不應該出現的東西而分心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. So it's maybe that he's not going to crash with the airplane, but instead of concentrating on flying his airplane, he's being distracted by an unknown object that is somehow getting near him."
→ {"text": "所以也許他不會撞上飛機，但他無法專注於駕駛飛機，而是被某個不知名的、正在接近他的物體分散了注意力。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

156. So these are among the reasons that this subject should be investigated by the civil aviation agencies, which of course Chile is doing, but it should be done in other countries as well.
→ {"text": "因此，這些都是民航機構應該調查這個主題的理由之一，智利當然正在這麼做，但其他國家也應該如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

157. The story this morning of the pilot chasing this UFO, I think I heard that in spite of how big it was and how obvious it was, there was no radar track?
→ {"text": "今天上午關於飛行員追逐 UFO 的故事，我想我聽說儘管它體積龐大且非常明顯，但雷達上沒有軌跡？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

158. I don't...
→ {"text": "我不⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

159. I think that's what I remember here.
→ {"text": "我想我記得是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

160. Yeah, I'm not sure of that.
→ {"text": "是的，我不太確定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

161. But I might as well add, there are another very significant case which happened in Iran in 1976, which again was revealed by American Defense Attaché documents.
→ {"text": "不過我不妨補充一下，還有另一起非常重要的案例發生在 1976 年的伊朗，同樣是由美國國防武官的文件所揭露。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

162. That's how the case became public, very famous case.
→ {"text": "這個案例就是這樣公諸於世的，非常著名的案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

163. The pilot at the time was a captain, eventually became a major general in the Iranian Air Force.
→ {"text": "當時的飛行員是一名上尉，後來成為伊朗空軍的少將。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

164. In fact, he came and testified at a previous symposium here at the National Press Club.
→ {"text": "事實上，他曾來到國家新聞俱樂部（National Press Club）之前的研討會上作證。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "National Press Club 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「國家新聞俱樂部」"}

165. He was the pilot that...same thing, this huge UFO object was flying over Tehran.
→ {"text": "他就是那位飛行員⋯⋯同樣的情況，一個巨大的 UFO 在德黑蘭上空飛行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

166. This was in the days of the Shah.
→ {"text": "這是在國王統治時期。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "the Shah 指伊朗巴勒維國王"}

167. So the US had very good relations, as you know, with Iran, and that's how they got all the reports.
→ {"text": "如您所知，美國當時與伊朗關係非常好，這就是他們獲得所有報告的原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

168. But the difference there is that as he was instructed, again, to fire at this object because the object was not responding, was not identifying itself, suddenly all his weapons control panel was jammed and he could not fire.
→ {"text": "但不同之處在於，當他再次接到指令要向這個物體開火——因為該物體沒有回應、沒有識別自己——突然間，他所有的武器控制面板都失靈了，無法開火。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

169. The thing wasn't working.
→ {"text": "系統完全不運作了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

170. The electromagnetic communication, the radio, everything was malfunction.
→ {"text": "電磁通訊、無線電，所有東西都故障了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. This was an F-4 Phantom jet.
→ {"text": "這是一架 F-4 幽靈戰機（F-4 Phantom jet）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "F-4 Phantom jet 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「F-4 幽靈戰機」"}

172. And then, according to this pilot, who later became a general, he said that from the UFO, like a little object came, like the UFO was responding, that's as close as an actual combat between a UFO and it's all documented by the US government.
→ {"text": "然後，根據這位後來成為將軍的飛行員所述，他說從 UFO 中飛出了一個小物體，就像 UFO 在回應一樣，這是最接近 UFO 實際戰鬥的情況，而且全部由美國政府記錄在案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

173. There was even an evaluation by the Defense Intelligence Agency, which was later declassified, that call it an outstanding UFO report because it validated the existence of UFOs.
→ {"text": "國防情報局（Defense Intelligence Agency）甚至進行了評估，後來解密的文件稱其為傑出的 UFO 報告，因為它驗證了 UFO 的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Defense Intelligence Agency 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「國防情報局」"}

174. This in the words of our own government.
→ {"text": "這是我們自己政府的原話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

175. And they list all the reasons why, because it was multiple witnesses.
→ {"text": "他們列出了所有理由，因為有多名目擊者。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

176. Some of the witnesses were very high ranking generals.

181. We don't know that.
→ {"text": "我們不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

182. But that the object was real, there's no question about it.
→ {"text": "但這個物體是真實的，這一點毫無疑問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

183. If it's true that these things can deflect bullets and not be affected, then somehow they might be able to absorb radar and have no reflection?
→ {"text": "如果這些東西真的能偏轉子彈而不受影響，那麼它們某種程度上也許能吸收雷達波而沒有反射？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 absorb bullets 為轉錄錯誤，正確為 deflect bullets（偏轉子彈），依照 topics.json potential_errors 修正"}

184. Yes.

187. With airplanes, it's more worrisome because a car can stop in the middle of a close encounter and nothing will happen except inconvenience.
→ {"text": "對飛機而言更令人擔憂，因為汽車可以在近距離接觸的過程中停下來，除了不便之外不會發生什麼事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "close encounter 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「近距離接觸」"}

188. But if you're flying an airplane and your electrical system, you know, your engine stalls, you're in trouble.
→ {"text": "但如果你正在駕駛飛機，而電氣系統——你知道的，引擎熄火了——你就麻煩了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

189. But with airplanes, it's not as common, but there have been cases, although not crashes or perhaps.
