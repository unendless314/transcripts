## Speaker Group 1

220. Congressman Cook?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. I'd like to resume with Grant Cameron and talk about the Wilbert Smith files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. Wilbert Smith was the minister of—or one of the—worked for the Ministry of Transport.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. He was a senior radio engineer, and he later became superintendent of radio regulations for the Department of Transport.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. In Canada, of course.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. And this file on UFOs was begun about 1950, am I right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. The official government file goes from 1950 to 1954.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. His personal files—he died in 1962—became public in about 1982.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. His son released them to the University of Ottawa.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. Thank you for that, because I wanted to check for sure on when he died.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. That was about 20 years before those files were released?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. Correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. You've obviously looked at what's in those released files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. What is the very best evidence in those Wilbert Smith files that we've just been talking about?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

241. The very best.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. If you had to take one specific incident or example, the very best you can think of, of an ET association with an unidentified flying object.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. And then I'm going to ask, in fact—or let me put any kind of ET association or body-found association.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. That's the testimony I presented today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. The best we would have is the question that Wilbur, in his files, asked to Dr. Robert Sarbacher in Washington in 1950 about the validity of the Crash Saucer book released in 1950, and he gets the response.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. The facts in the book are substantially correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. Now, Wilbur had a lot of interaction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. There was contacts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. They were in contact with an alien, the same one that the CIA was in contact with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. There's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. But in terms of an actual document, in terms of the actual material that's the hardest evidence is the material that he got from the Americans in 1950, which he used to write the top-secret memo, which he sent to the Deputy Minister of the Department of Transport asking for funds to research propulsion, of UFO propulsion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

253. And he was given authorization, and that project ran until 1954 when this overflight of the Flying Saucer Station took place, and they shut the program down and made the statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. There's nothing to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. No equity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. But the document—in other words, the best evidence of a body found is what was spoken between Dr. Saubacher and Wilbert Smith.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. Is that what I'm understanding?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

258. And is that in one of those documents that was released?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. Well, it's in the—I released to you today Smith's handwritten interview of the interview that he did in 1950, and it's later substantiated by Robert Saubacher, who says there were reports of instruments or people operating these machines, because he was questioned after Wilbur Smith died.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. People like Stanton Friedman started looking for him, and he says, "I remember in talking with some of the people in the office that they got the impression that these aliens were constructed."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. And he talks about what the aliens looked like.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. And he mentions in the room where von Braun, Oppenheimer, a number of the top scientists in the United States in 1950 were telling these stories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. So Saubacher confirms the fact that he talked to Smith in 1950, and that he confirms in the letter that there were alien bodies involved.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. I appreciate your answer, and that's—what you've just described is what you feel is the best evidence of the question I asked.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. Fine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. To Nick Pope, I'd like to ask you, while you were working in the Ministry of Defense in the UK, did any of your superiors tell you that part of your job is to ridicule English citizens or any UK citizen who had maybe filed a report or a siding that was legitimate?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. Nobody told me to do that directly, sir, but there was certainly a sort of unofficial policy that in responding to media inquiries, the press office would deliberately slip in terms such as little green men and flying saucers to disparage and downplay the subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. And they haven't told you what to say as a private citizen, have they?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. No, sir, but when I've written books, which I have in the past, I've had to submit those for official security clearance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. Now I'd like to turn to our witness from the People's Republic of China.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. Dr. Sun Shili, you've said what I think are truly interesting things when you say that the majority of the people of China absolutely believe not just in UFOs, but in an extraterrestrial source of the UFOs, and they believe in aliens.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. In fact, you made a statement earlier in your testimony that you put the existence of aliens right in with UFOs as something that's clearly – well, certainly you believe it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. I understand that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. And you talked about five events of what you call third kind cases, and I'll repeat those from your testimony a few hours ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. The Phoenix Mountain event – I want you to listen to these events carefully.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. You know them well, I'm sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. The Phoenix Mountain event, the Faxiang trapeze event, the Beijing Sokong event, the River Forest event, the Mayang alien research station event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. Of those, I take it those are maybe some of the top five of all that China has gathered, which has been amazingly voluminous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. Give us an example from one or two, if you'd like, and I want to know the best thing you can tell us from any of those events you've already mentioned that would give us some sense that there's an extraterrestrial origin to these sightings and to these UFOs, or that there are bodies, or aliens, alive or dead from these.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. Okay?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. I would like to talk about two, the first one and the last one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. The first one is the Phoenix Mountain event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. This is in the northeastern China, there is a farm there, and a ranger saw a flying disk within 100 meters, and he felt really uncomfortable, so he tried to stay away from that flying disk, and he and his cousin felt that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. I hate to interrupt, but could you give us the year of this, or the time, the essential time?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. Approximately. 1994.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. In June 1994.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. Go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. Continue, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. So, on the second day, this ranger led a dozen of people from the same farm trying to find that flying disk again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. And what happened was that there was a lightning coming from the sky, and he was attacked by this lightning right on his head.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. So, he fainted, and during the time that he was out, he felt that aliens were communicating with him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. He had a lot of physical reactions, and he claimed that aliens had implanted some objects into his body.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. And after that, this alien also had sexual contact with him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. And after that, he was told that this sexual contact is a very -- Anything you can refer to that would show something that could make the Chinese government or any other government aware of any of this, to make this story so far, which is a pretty significant story, of course, but to make it accepted by -- does the Chinese government know about this story?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. Let me put it that way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. Have they commented on it, and what evidence has been given to them about the story you just outlined?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. Well, we have a lot of evidence in this event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. We have gathered more than 100 people and conducted more than a dozen of investigations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. We have used lie detectors to test and verify the truthfulness of the things that these people are claiming.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. So we have gathered information, and we have done investigation in this area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. And so in this incident, we have seen this very special interaction between aliens and humans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. Would you say, then, that Phoenix Mountain would be your prime case, rather than, say, the Beijing Zuoanmen event, in terms of the question I asked, which is your best evidence of extraterrestrial involvement, or an alien, which you've certainly described -- you've described aliens with more activities than anybody else has described them in the three or four days here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. And so I just want to know to what extent the Chinese government is really aware or believes it, or -- and that doesn't necessarily prove it one way or the other, by any means, but I just want to know where documentation can be, where we can start working on this case, because it's kind of an interesting one, very interesting one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. Right, the Chinese government, I think they know, because this incident was very, very hotly spread within the country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. Everybody knows.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. It's very popular.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. It was reported everywhere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. But after more than 10 years of research and investigation and verification, as well as evidence collection, which included the tracks that the UFOs have left in the mountains, and the trees and the plants that were destructed by their landing, we have gathered all those evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. And we have also brought a scientist to -- I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. I appreciate it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. Thank you for your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. We're down to you, Representative -- yes, not -- I'm sorry, Senator Gravel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
