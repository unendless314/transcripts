244. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. That's the testimony I presented today.
→ {"text": "那就是我今天呈現的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. The best we would have is the question that Wilbur, in his files, asked to Dr. Robert Sarbacher in Washington in 1950 about the validity of the Crash Saucer book released in 1950, and he gets the response.
→ {"text": "我們擁有的最佳證據，是威爾伯在他的檔案中記錄的內容——他於 1950 年在華盛頓向羅伯特·薩巴赫博士（Dr. Robert Sarbacher）詢問 1950 年出版的《墜毀飛碟》一書的真實性，並得到了回應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文轉錄為 'Dr. Robert Saubacher'，正確應為 'Dr. Robert Sarbacher'（羅伯特·薩巴赫博士），已修正翻譯"}

247. The facts in the book are substantially correct.
→ {"text": "書中的事實基本正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. Now, Wilbur had a lot of interaction.
→ {"text": "威爾伯當時有很多互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. There was contacts.
→ {"text": "有過接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. They were in contact with an alien, the same one that the CIA was in contact with.
→ {"text": "他們曾與一名外星人有過接觸，就是 CIA 接觸過的那位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "CIA 依照 terminology.yaml 保留原文"}

251. There's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes.
→ {"text": "幕後發生了很多事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. But in terms of an actual document, in terms of the actual material that's the hardest evidence is the material that he got from the Americans in 1950, which he used to write the top-secret memo, which he sent to the Deputy Minister of the Department of Transport asking for funds to research propulsion, of UFO propulsion.
→ {"text": "但就實際文件而言，就實際資料而言，最有力的證據是他在 1950 年從美國人那裡取得的資料，他用這些資料撰寫了最高機密備忘錄，並將其呈交給交通部副部長，申請資金研究 UFO 推進系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "top-secret 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「最高機密」"}

253. And he was given authorization, and that project ran until 1954 when this overflight of the Flying Saucer Station took place, and they shut the program down and made the statement.
→ {"text": "他獲得了授權，該計畫一直持續到 1954 年，當時發生了飛碟觀測站上空飛越事件，他們隨後關閉了計畫並發表聲明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Flying Saucer 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「飛碟」"}

254. There's nothing to it.
→ {"text": "這沒什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. No equity.
→ {"text": "沒有價值。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "equity 在此語境可能指「價值」或「實質內容」"}

256. But the document—in other words, the best evidence of a body found is what was spoken between Dr. Saubacher and Wilbert Smith.
→ {"text": "但這份文件——換句話說，發現屍體的最佳證據是羅伯特·薩巴赫博士與威爾伯特·史密斯之間的談話內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文轉錄為 'Dr. Saubacher'，正確應為 'Dr. Sarbacher'"}

257. Is that what I'm understanding?
→ {"text": "我理解得對嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. And is that in one of those documents that was released?
→ {"text": "這內容在公開的文件中嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. Well, it's in the—I released to you today Smith's handwritten interview of the interview that he did in 1950, and it's later substantiated by Robert Saubacher, who says there were reports of instruments or people operating these machines, because he was questioned after Wilbur Smith died.
→ {"text": "嗯，它在——我今天向各位公開了史密斯親筆記錄的 1950 年訪談筆記，後來羅伯特·薩巴赫證實了這些內容，他說有關於儀器或操作這些機器的人的報告，因為他是在威爾伯·史密斯去世後被詢問的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文轉錄為 'Robert Saubacher'，正確應為 'Robert Sarbacher'（羅伯特·薩巴赫博士）"}

260. People like Stanton Friedman started looking for him, and he says, "I remember in talking with some of the people in the office that they got the impression that these aliens were constructed."
→ {"text": "像史坦頓·弗里德曼（Stanton Friedman）這樣的人開始尋找他，他說：「我記得在與辦公室裡的一些人交談時，他們得到的印象是這些外星人是被建造出來的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. And he talks about what the aliens looked like.
→ {"text": "他還談到了這些外星人的外貌。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. And he mentions in the room where von Braun, Oppenheimer, a number of the top scientists in the United States in 1950 were telling these stories.
→ {"text": "他提到在那個房間裡，馮·布朗（von Braun）、奧本海默（Oppenheimer）以及美國的許多頂尖科學家在 1950 年都在講述這些故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "von Braun 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「馮·布朗」"}

263. So Saubacher confirms the fact that he talked to Smith in 1950, and that he confirms in the letter that there were alien bodies involved.
→ {"text": "所以薩巴赫證實了他在 1950 年與史密斯交談的事實，他在信中證實了涉及外星屍體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文轉錄為 'Saubacher'，正確應為 'Sarbacher'（薩巴赫）"}

264. I appreciate your answer, and that's—what you've just described is what you feel is the best evidence of the question I asked.
→ {"text": "我很感謝您的回答，那就是——您剛才描述的就是您認為最能回答我所提問題的最佳證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. Fine.
→ {"text": "很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. To Nick Pope, I'd like to ask you, while you were working in the Ministry of Defense in the UK, did any of your superiors tell you that part of your job is to ridicule English citizens or any UK citizen who had maybe filed a report or a siding that was legitimate?
→ {"text": "尼克·波普（Nick Pope），我想問您，當您在英國國防部工作時，是否有上級告訴您，您的工作之一就是嘲笑那些提交了可能合法的目擊報告的英國公民？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Nick Pope 和 Ministry of Defense 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯；siding 疑似為 sighting 的轉錄錯誤"}

270. Nobody told me to do that directly, sir, but there was certainly a sort of unofficial policy that in responding to media inquiries, the press office would deliberately slip in terms such as little green men and flying saucers to disparage and downplay the subject.
→ {"text": "先生，沒有人直接這樣告訴我，但確實存在某種非官方政策——在回應媒體詢問時，新聞辦公室會刻意使用「小綠人」（little green men）和「飛碟」（flying saucers）等詞彙來貶低和淡化這個主題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "little green men 為嘲諷用語；flying saucers 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「飛碟」"}

271. And they haven't told you what to say as a private citizen, have they?
→ {"text": "他們沒有告訴您作為私人公民該說什麼，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. No, sir, but when I've written books, which I have in the past, I've had to submit those for official security clearance.
→ {"text": "沒有，先生，但當我撰寫書籍時——我過去確實寫過——我必須提交這些書稿進行官方安全審查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. Now I'd like to turn to our witness from the People's Republic of China.
→ {"text": "現在我想請教來自中華人民共和國的證人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "People's Republic of China 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「中華人民共和國」"}

275. Dr. Sun Shili, you've said what I think are truly interesting things when you say that the majority of the people of China absolutely believe not just in UFOs, but in an extraterrestrial source of the UFOs, and they believe in aliens.
→ {"text": "孫式立博士（Dr. Sun Shili），您說了我認為非常有趣的事情——您說中國的大多數人民絕對相信的不僅是 UFO，還相信 UFO 來自外星，他們相信外星人的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文轉錄為 'Dr. Sheila'，正確應為 'Dr. Sun Shili'（孫式立博士）；extraterrestrial 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「外星的」"}

276. In fact, you made a statement earlier in your testimony that you put the existence of aliens right in with UFOs as something that's clearly – well, certainly you believe it.
→ {"text": "事實上，您在先前的證詞中表示，您將外星人的存在與 UFO 直接聯繫在一起，視為某種明確的事物——嗯，您確實相信這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. I understand that.
→ {"text": "我理解這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. And you talked about five events of what you call third kind cases, and I'll repeat those from your testimony a few hours ago.
→ {"text": "您談到了五個您稱之為第三類接觸案例的事件，我會重複您幾小時前證詞中提到的那些案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "third kind cases 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「第三類接觸案例」"}

279. The Phoenix Mountain event – I want you to listen to these events carefully.
→ {"text": "鳳凰山事件——我希望您仔細聽這些事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Phoenix Mountain event 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「鳳凰山事件」"}

280. You know them well, I'm sure.
→ {"text": "我相信您對它們很熟悉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. The Phoenix Mountain event, the Faxiang trapeze event, the Beijing Sokong event, the River Forest event, the Mayang alien research station event.
→ {"text": "鳳凰山事件、法相空中飛人事件、北京左安門事件、河林事件、馬陽外星研究站事件。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "Beijing Sokong event 依照 topics.json 修正為 Beijing Zuoanmen event（北京左安門事件）；其他事件名稱為音譯"}

282. Of those, I take it those are maybe some of the top five of all that China has gathered, which has been amazingly voluminous.
→ {"text": "我想這些可能是中國收集到的所有案例中最重要的五個，而中國收集的案例數量驚人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. Give us an example from one or two, if you'd like, and I want to know the best thing you can tell us from any of those events you've already mentioned that would give us some sense that there's an extraterrestrial origin to these sightings and to these UFOs, or that there are bodies, or aliens, alive or dead from these.
→ {"text": "請您舉一兩個例子，我想知道您能從這些已經提到的事件中告訴我們的最佳證據，讓我們能夠感受到這些目擊事件和這些 UFO 具有外星起源，或者存在屍體，或者有活著或死去的外星人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "extraterrestrial 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯"}

284. Okay?
→ {"text": "可以嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. Yes.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. I would like to talk about two, the first one and the last one.
→ {"text": "我想談談兩個，第一個和最後一個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. The first one is the Phoenix Mountain event.
→ {"text": "第一個是鳳凰山事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Phoenix Mountain event 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯"}

288. This is in the northeastern China, there is a farm there, and a ranger saw a flying disk within 100 meters, and he felt really uncomfortable, so he tried to stay away from that flying disk, and he and his cousin felt that.
→ {"text": "這發生在中國東北部，那裡有一個農場，一名護林員在 100 公尺內看到一個飛行圓盤，他感到非常不舒服，所以他試圖遠離那個飛行圓盤，他和他的表親都有這種感覺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. I hate to interrupt, but could you give us the year of this, or the time, the essential time?
→ {"text": "抱歉打斷您，但您能否告訴我們這件事發生的年份或時間，大致的時間？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. Approximately. 1994.

291. In June 1994.

292. Go ahead.
→ {"text": "請繼續。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

293. Continue, please.
→ {"text": "請繼續說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

294. So, on the second day, this ranger led a dozen of people from the same farm trying to find that flying disk again.
→ {"text": "所以在第二天，這名護林員帶領同一農場的十幾個人試圖再次尋找那個飛行圓盤。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

295. And what happened was that there was a lightning coming from the sky, and he was attacked by this lightning right on his head.
→ {"text": "結果發生的事情是，天空中出現了一道閃電，這道閃電直接擊中了他的頭部。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

296. So, he fainted, and during the time that he was out, he felt that aliens were communicating with him.
→ {"text": "所以他昏倒了，在他失去意識的期間，他感覺到外星人正在與他溝通。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

297. He had a lot of physical reactions, and he claimed that aliens had implanted some objects into his body.
→ {"text": "他有很多身體反應，他聲稱外星人在他體內植入了一些物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

298. And after that, this alien also had sexual contact with him.
→ {"text": "在那之後，這個外星人還與他發生了性接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

299. And after that, he was told that this sexual contact is a very -- Anything you can refer to that would show something that could make the Chinese government or any other government aware of any of this, to make this story so far, which is a pretty significant story, of course, but to make it accepted by -- does the Chinese government know about this story?
→ {"text": "在那之後，他被告知這次性接觸是非常——您能否提供任何可以展示的東西，讓中國政府或任何其他政府意識到這些事情，以使這個目前為止的故事——這當然是一個相當重要的故事——被接受——中國政府知道這個故事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

300. Let me put it that way.
→ {"text": "讓我這樣說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

301. Have they commented on it, and what evidence has been given to them about the story you just outlined?
→ {"text": "他們對此有何評論，關於您剛才概述的故事，向他們提供了什麼證據？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

302. Well, we have a lot of evidence in this event.
→ {"text": "嗯，我們在這個事件中有很多證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

303. We have gathered more than 100 people and conducted more than a dozen of investigations.
→ {"text": "我們訪談了 100 多人，進行了十多次調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

304. We have used lie detectors to test and verify the truthfulness of the things that these people are claiming.
→ {"text": "我們使用測謊儀來測試和驗證這些人所聲稱事情的真實性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

305. So we have gathered information, and we have done investigation in this area.
→ {"text": "所以我們收集了資訊，並在這個地區進行了調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

306. And so in this incident, we have seen this very special interaction between aliens and humans.
→ {"text": "因此在這起事件中，我們看到了外星人與人類之間非常特殊的互動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

307. Would you say, then, that Phoenix Mountain would be your prime case, rather than, say, the Beijing Zuoanmen event, in terms of the question I asked, which is your best evidence of extraterrestrial involvement, or an alien, which you've certainly described -- you've described aliens with more activities than anybody else has described them in the three or four days here.
→ {"text": "那麼您是否會說，就我提出的問題而言，鳳凰山事件會是您的首要案例，而不是北京左安門事件——也就是您關於外星介入或外星人的最佳證據，您確實描述了——您對外星人活動的描述比這三、四天裡任何其他人描述得都要詳細。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文轉錄為 'Beijing Zoukong event'，依照 topics.json 修正為 'Beijing Zuoanmen event'（北京左安門事件）；extraterrestrial 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯"}

308. And so I just want to know to what extent the Chinese government is really aware or believes it, or -- and that doesn't necessarily prove it one way or the other, by any means, but I just want to know where documentation can be, where we can start working on this case, because it's kind of an interesting one, very interesting one.
→ {"text": "所以我只是想知道中國政府在多大程度上真正知曉或相信這件事，或者——這無論如何都不一定能證明什麼，但我只是想知道文件資料在哪裡，我們可以從哪裡開始研究這個案例，因為這是個相當有趣的案例，非常有趣的案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

309. Right, the Chinese government, I think they know, because this incident was very, very hotly spread within the country.
→ {"text": "對，中國政府，我認為他們知道，因為這起事件在國內廣為流傳。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

310. Everybody knows.
→ {"text": "每個人都知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

311. It's very popular.
→ {"text": "這事非常流行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

312. It was reported everywhere.
→ {"text": "到處都有報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

313. But after more than 10 years of research and investigation and verification, as well as evidence collection, which included the tracks that the UFOs have left in the mountains, and the trees and the plants that were destructed by their landing, we have gathered all those evidence.
→ {"text": "但經過 10 多年的研究、調查和驗證，以及證據收集——包括 UFO 在山上留下的痕跡，以及因其降落而被破壞的樹木和植物——我們收集了所有這些證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

314. And we have also brought a scientist to -- I understand.
→ {"text": "我們還帶來了一位科學家——我明白。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

315. I appreciate it.

320. We're down to you, Representative -- yes, not -- I'm sorry, Senator Gravel.
→ {"text": "輪到您了，眾議員——是的，不——抱歉，格拉維爾參議員（Senator Gravel）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
