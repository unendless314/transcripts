## Speaker Group 1

578. I have a couple of quick questions, hopefully.
→ {"text": "希望能問幾個簡短的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. Anyone can answer.
→ {"text": "任何人都可以回答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

580. I'd like to hear from all of you if we can do it in a short period of time.
→ {"text": "如果可以在短時間內完成，我想聽聽各位的意見。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

581. What are the practical steps that we can do to take this issue forward, and is an international cooperative like the United Nations a possibility?
→ {"text": "我們可以採取哪些實際步驟來推動這個議題，透過聯合國（United Nations）進行國際合作是否可行？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "首次提到 United Nations，中英文並列"}

582. Yes, there is a possibility.
→ {"text": "是的，有這個可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. You know that the Grenada resolution was simply frozen, and any member state of the United States could take this resolution and to put it into the agenda.
→ {"text": "您知道格瑞那達決議（Grenada resolution）只是被凍結了，任何聯合國會員國都可以重新提出這項決議並列入議程。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文 'United States' 應為 'United Nations'（聯合國會員國），這是轉錄錯誤"}

584. Then we will have a vote from the United Nations, and we will see if by case this commission, permanent commission for UFOs in the United Nations, may be created or not.
→ {"text": "然後聯合國就會進行投票，屆時我們就能看到這個委員會——聯合國 UFO 常設委員會——是否能夠成立。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

585. Personally, I tried to do something with the San Marino Republic, which is a member state of the United Nations, but frankly, I had some problems.
→ {"text": "就個人而言，我曾試圖與聖馬利諾共和國（San Marino Republic）合作推動，它是聯合國會員國，但坦白說，我遇到了一些問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "San Marino Republic 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯"}

586. We had some problems, because the first question they asked me is, "Okay, but what do you think the United States government may think about this?"
→ {"text": "我們遇到了一些問題，因為他們問我的第一個問題就是：「好吧，但您認為美國政府會怎麼看待這件事？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

587. I have nothing else to say.
→ {"text": "我無話可說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

589. Antonio?
→ {"text": "安東尼奧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指 Antonio Huneeus"}

590. The UN, of course, would be excellent in my conversations with the different heads of the South American agencies.
→ {"text": "在我與南美洲各機構負責人的對話中，聯合國當然會是個絕佳選擇。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

591. They're eager, because they feel that they have these programs, which most of them have started recently, except Uruguay, who were the pioneers, but they have nowhere to report, so I mean, officially.
→ {"text": "他們很渴望這樣做，因為他們覺得自己有這些計畫——大多數是最近才開始的，除了烏拉圭是先驅——但他們沒有地方可以報告，我是指正式報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

592. Some place where the data could begin to be officially and legally marshalled in one single place, so that would be a step that would be excellent.
→ {"text": "需要有一個地方，讓資料能夠開始以正式且合法的方式彙整到單一地點，這將是非常好的一步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

593. But the problem of the UN, it has to be a member state has to bring it up.
→ {"text": "但聯合國的問題在於，必須由會員國提出。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

594. In the case of Granada, Prime Minister Gairy was almost obsessed with the subject, so he had a mission, and he pursued it, as we know, for many years, until he was overthrown, because he wasn't taking care of the business in his own country.
→ {"text": "以格瑞那達為例，蓋瑞總理（Prime Minister Gairy）幾乎為這個議題著迷，所以他有個使命，如我們所知，他追求了許多年，直到被推翻為止，因為他沒有處理好自己國家的事務。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指 Eric Gairy，格瑞那達總理，1970年代向聯合國推動 UFO 調查"}

595. He was spending so much time in New York that he was disregarding, even though he was the founding father of that island.
→ {"text": "他花了太多時間待在紐約，以至於疏忽了國政，儘管他是那座島國的開國元勳。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. Then, I don't know, it would be nice to have congressional hearings, but I appreciate your work here greatly, but with people who are currently in Congress, because then the oath, and then you could really bring officials, and by subpoena if necessary, and really try to get to the bottom of this.
→ {"text": "然後，我不知道，舉行國會聽證會會很好，我非常感謝您在這裡的工作，但要有現任國會議員參與，因為這樣就有宣誓，然後您就真的可以傳喚官員，必要時透過傳票，真正追根究底。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

597. There's so much allegations and rumours, and probably half of those are false, and maybe the US government is getting a bad rep, but it's partly their own fault, because of so much secrecy, and we could, what is really happening in Area 51, have we incorporated some of this technology into weapons?
→ {"text": "有太多指控和謠言，其中可能有一半是假的，也許美國政府名聲不好，但這部分是他們自己的錯，因為太過保密，而我們可以問，51 區（Area 51）到底發生了什麼事，我們是否已經將部分技術整合到武器中？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Area 51 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「51 區」"}

598. There's all these kinds of allegations, but because we're dealing with classified areas, it's impossible to know, and so that would be another step.
→ {"text": "有各式各樣的指控，但因為我們處理的是機密領域，所以不可能知道真相，因此這會是另一個步驟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "classified 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「機密」"}

599. If the other countries of the world saw that there were hearings in the US and stuff like that, probably they would do the same, then it would give cover to a lot of other countries, even though many countries, as you know, are trying and are releasing files, and in South America especially, they're creating agencies.
→ {"text": "如果世界其他國家看到美國舉行聽證會之類的，他們可能也會這麼做，這樣就能為許多其他國家提供掩護，儘管如您所知，許多國家正在努力並公開檔案，尤其在南美洲，他們正在建立專責機構。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

600. Those would be two good steps, and they're probably others too.
→ {"text": "這將是兩個很好的步驟，可能還有其他步驟。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

601. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

602. Mr. Pope?
→ {"text": "波普先生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指 Nick Pope"}

603. The head of the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs attended a Royal Society discussion meeting in the UK in 2010.
→ {"text": "聯合國外太空事務辦公室（United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs）的主管於 2010 年出席了在英國舉行的英國皇家學會（Royal Society）討論會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯"}

604. Now, I hasten to add that was an astrobiology meeting, and not a UFO meeting, but it did discuss in a speculative way some of the issues that might arise, be they religious, scientific, and technical, societal, if we did detect extraterrestrial life or even another civilization, but she said that when it comes to the role of the UN, one must approach the UN with consensus on this sort of issue, so I don't think there's much practical hope of that.
→ {"text": "我要趕緊補充，那是一場天體生物學會議，而非 UFO 會議，但確實以推測性的方式討論了一些可能出現的問題——無論是宗教、科學、技術還是社會層面——如果我們確實偵測到外星生命（extraterrestrial life）甚至另一個文明的話，但她說，談到聯合國的角色，必須在這類議題上達成共識才能接觸聯合國，所以我認為這在實際上沒有太大希望。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "extraterrestrial 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯"}

605. On regard to your other question about practical steps that could be taken, I think one meaningful step would be to incorporate whatever you believe about UFOs, some module into pilot training, because whatever the government says or does about UFOs, civil and military pilots, do continue to see these things.
→ {"text": "關於您提出的另一個問題，即可以採取哪些實際步驟，我認為一個有意義的步驟是，無論您對 UFO 有何看法，都應該將某種模組納入飛行員訓練中，因為無論政府對 UFO 說了什麼或做了什麼，民用和軍用飛行員確實持續目擊這些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

606. Great idea.
→ {"text": "很好的想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

608. Mr. Cameron?
→ {"text": "卡麥隆先生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指 Grant Cameron"}

609. I would agree with an international United Nations type thing.
→ {"text": "我同意透過聯合國這類國際組織的方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

610. I don't think congressional will help, because it doesn't help anybody, it doesn't help you to get elected, which is what it's all about.
→ {"text": "我不認為國會聽證會會有幫助，因為這對任何人都沒有幫助，無助於你當選，而這才是重點所在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

611. In terms of this week, I think we're no different than any other social or political movement, no matter how important we think we are, and when the time is right, it'll happen, and we have to keep making moves, and I think the move we've made this week to do this is a step ahead, so we are making steps.
→ {"text": "就這一週而言，我認為我們與其他任何社會或政治運動沒有什麼不同，無論我們認為自己多麼重要，當時機成熟時，事情就會發生，而我們必須持續採取行動，我認為我們這週所做的行動是向前邁進的一步，所以我們正在進步。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

612. And it's like the women's right to vote, it started in 1848, they didn't get the right to vote until 1920, and even then their problems weren't solved.
→ {"text": "這就像婦女投票權，始於 1848 年，她們直到 1920 年才獲得投票權，即便如此，她們的問題也沒有解決。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

613. We're no different.
→ {"text": "我們沒有什麼不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

614. We've got to make moves, we've got to put pressure on, that's how I think it's going to happen.
→ {"text": "我們必須採取行動，必須施加壓力，我認為事情就是這樣發生的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

615. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

616. Dr. Shelley?
→ {"text": "孫博士？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指 Dr. Sun Shili（孫世力博士），Whisper 誤聽為 Dr. Shelley"}

617. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

618. I've talked about, I'm trying to facilitate a summit meeting to talk about UFO and the universe, and universal exploration, and not only that, and we have, as a humankind, we've encountered many problems, probably in this summit, we'll be able to solve some of the difficulties.
→ {"text": "我談過，我正在努力促成一場高峰會，討論 UFO 和宇宙、宇宙探索，不僅如此，作為人類，我們遇到了許多問題，在這場高峰會上，我們可能能夠解決一些困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

619. Now, we are trying to cohere the strength of all of the world.
→ {"text": "現在，我們正試圖凝聚全世界的力量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

620. Now, I'm trying to form a committee of the thinkers of our world, and try to gather all the intellectuals around the world together, and also that we should come to a conclusion on all the cases, and a few years ago, some experts, that some of the people that advised that Senator Goldwater, whether he could conduct investigation or promote investigation of the Area 51, he did not believe about this Area 51, and I was very honored he invited me.
→ {"text": "現在，我正試圖組建一個由世界思想家組成的委員會，試圖將全世界的知識分子聚集在一起，而且我們應該對所有案例得出結論，幾年前，一些專家，一些曾建議高華德參議員（Senator Goldwater）是否可以進行調查或推動 51 區（Area 51）調查的人，他不相信 51 區的存在，我很榮幸他邀請了我。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "句子結構較複雜，可能需要審校"}

621. So, we had a small group formed, and Senator Goldwater was a chair, and it was a co-chair, and then, regretfully, he was quite old at the time, and he went to the hospital, so he asked his secretary to apologize for me, for the success of this forming a group, so you can see that for such a prestigious person to be involved in the investigation, if we can get somebody like that, we will come to a fruitful conclusion.
→ {"text": "所以，我們成立了一個小組，高華德參議員擔任主席，我擔任聯合主席，然後，遺憾的是，他當時年紀已大，住進了醫院，所以他請他的秘書代他向我致歉，對於這個小組的成功組建，所以您可以看到，這樣一位聲望卓著的人參與調查，如果我們能找到這樣的人，我們就會得出有成果的結論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Senator Goldwater 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「高華德參議員」"}

622. This is a very major event.
→ {"text": "這是一件非常重大的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

623. If, after the investigation, and we come to a conclusion that there is no UFO or ET, then that's fine, but if we can verify there is actually UFO and ET, that's great.
→ {"text": "如果經過調查後，我們得出結論認為沒有 UFO 或外星人（ET），那也很好，但如果我們能驗證確實存在 UFO 和外星人，那就太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "ET = extraterrestrial，外星人"}

624. Mr. Pinotti, you already gave your answer to this one, didn't you?
→ {"text": "皮諾提先生，您已經回答過這個問題了，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指 Roberto Pinotti"}

625. Excuse me?

629. You started.
→ {"text": "您是第一個回答的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

630. The problem of interacting on international level, and having the possibility to bring this argument to the attention of United Nations and so on, is a big one.
→ {"text": "在國際層面互動，並有可能將這個議題提交聯合國等組織關注，這是一個大問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

631. I think that, probably, little nations may be more interested.

632. Big nations may have big problems.
→ {"text": "大國可能有大問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

633. In fact, as I told you before, I tried to move something with the Little Republic of San Marino, since this could be extremely simple.
→ {"text": "事實上，如我之前所說，我試圖與聖馬利諾小共和國推動一些事情，因為這可能非常簡單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

634. But there are problems, because you see, for instance, in Italy, even if we have an official UFO group in the Italian Air Force, we have the facts, but we have no study, in the sense that our military say, we are all involved in defense.
→ {"text": "但存在問題，因為您看，例如在義大利，即使我們在義大利空軍有一個官方 UFO 小組，我們有事實，但我們沒有研究，在某種意義上，我們的軍方說，我們都參與國防。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

635. That's all.
→ {"text": "就這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

636. We don't like to draw any conclusion.
→ {"text": "我們不喜歡得出任何結論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

637. If we still have this attitude at the political level, everywhere, we will not be able to do anything.
→ {"text": "如果在政治層面上，無論何處，我們仍然保持這種態度，我們將無法做任何事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

638. I think that we must change our mentality, our way of thinking.

639. We should be aware of the fact that we are facing something absolutely new and absolutely real and absolutely from outside.
→ {"text": "我們應該意識到，我們正面對某種絕對嶄新、絕對真實、絕對來自外部的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

640. Don't remember that the first UFO sightings occurred in Europe, and particularly in Italy, in the '30s.
→ {"text": "別忘了，最早的 UFO 目擊事件發生在歐洲，特別是義大利，在 1930 年代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Don't forget 的意思，sightings 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「目擊事件」"}

641. They were advanced, intelligent, piloted crafts.
→ {"text": "它們是先進的、有智能的、有人駕駛的飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

642. They were studied by the fascist government.
→ {"text": "它們被法西斯政府研究過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指義大利墨索里尼政府"}

643. We knew this up to some years ago.
→ {"text": "我們直到幾年前才知道這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

644. But if this is true, and this is true, this means that these objects do not come from the Earth.
→ {"text": "但如果這是真的，而這確實是真的，這意味著這些物體不是來自地球。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

645. They come from outside the Earth.
→ {"text": "它們來自地球之外。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

646. And if this is true, we should be aware that we are facing an historical argument.
→ {"text": "如果這是真的，我們應該意識到，我們正面對一個歷史性的論點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

647. We are still discussing, and from a sociological point of view, I think that we are not too different from the cargo cult people who spoke in the Pacific after World War II about the passing airplanes, and that they thought they were some kind of divine means and so on.
→ {"text": "我們仍在討論，從社會學角度來看，我認為我們與第二次世界大戰後在太平洋地區談論過往飛機的貨物崇拜者（cargo cult people）沒有太大不同，他們認為那些是某種神聖的手段等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "cargo cult people 依照 topics.json 的 potential_errors 修正"}

648. Apart from this, we do not know the origin of this intelligence and of these crafts, but what is sure that we are sufficiently lucky that this intelligence are not hostile, and this is not too much, frankly.
→ {"text": "除此之外，我們不知道這種智慧和這些飛行器的起源，但可以確定的是，我們足夠幸運，這種智慧並不具有敵意，坦白說，這已經很不錯了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

649. What we should do, I think, is just to be aware of this and to try to understand more, but all together.
→ {"text": "我認為，我們應該做的就是意識到這一點，並試圖更加理解，但要一起努力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

650. Otherwise, if we still continue to be separated state by state, we won't do any conclusion.

653. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
→ {"text": "謝謝您，主席女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

654. Going along with your recommendations, I had suggested earlier that, and I think Mr. Cameron has shared that same view, is that another hearing, whether it's like this one or whether it's in the Congress, probably won't advance our goals all that much.
→ {"text": "按照各位的建議，我先前曾提出——我認為卡麥隆先生也持相同看法——再舉行一場聽證會，無論是像這樣的聽證會還是在國會舉行，可能都不會讓我們的目標有太大進展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

655. But there's no reason why, with the various countries represented here, with the various scholars and military officers, that we would try to, within our own communities, to get them to endorse a resolution, a very simple, straightforward resolution, calling upon the General Assembly, not get waylaid to the Security Council, because that's a dead letter also, but to take the matter to the General Assembly, all we would need is one country.
→ {"text": "但沒有理由不這樣做：在這裡代表的各國，以及各位學者和軍官，我們可以在自己的社群中努力，讓他們支持一項決議，一項非常簡單、直截了當的決議，呼籲聯合國大會（General Assembly）——不要被拖到安全理事會（Security Council），因為那也是一紙空文——但要將此事提交聯合國大會，我們只需要一個國家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "General Assembly 和 Security Council 依照 terminology.yaml 翻譯"}

656. But I think that we have several countries from South America, and certainly this group here might have enough influence to get their government to go on record and to field a resolution creating an agency of the United Nations without a lot of powers defined, but specifically with the goal to organize a global conference, not a hearing, a global conference of the scholars and scientists and whoever that would come together, and to fund it both from public and private sources, so that within a couple of years we could convene a conference that would command the attention of the world.
→ {"text": "但我認為我們有幾個南美國家，當然這裡的這個小組可能有足夠的影響力，讓他們的政府正式表態並提出一項決議，在聯合國創建一個機構，不需要定義太多權力，但明確以組織全球會議為目標，不是聽證會，而是學者、科學家以及任何人都可以參加的全球會議，並從公共和私人來源獲得資金，這樣我們就可以在幾年內召開一場引起全世界關注的會議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

657. I have no doubt, and I at one point in my career was a delegate to the United Nations from the Senate for four months, and I have no doubt that we could field that kind of a resolution and get it adopted, and then it would be the responsibility, or that would be the aegis of it all that would carry it forward, and then we could all have something now to hang our hats on.
→ {"text": "我毫不懷疑，我在職業生涯中曾有一段時間擔任參議院派駐聯合國的代表四個月，我毫不懷疑我們可以提出這樣的決議並讓它通過，然後這將成為責任所在，或者說這將成為推動一切的保護傘，然後我們都可以有所依靠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

658. Right now we're hanging our hat on the fine work that has been putting together this particular conference, but we can elevate it one notch higher, and not one notch higher, I mean we can elevate it right to where it really belongs, because it's a global issue, we could elevate it right to the General Assembly of the United Nations.
→ {"text": "現在我們依靠的是籌辦這場特別會議的出色工作，但我們可以將它提升一個層次，不只是一個層次，我的意思是我們可以將它提升到它真正應該屬於的地方，因為這是一個全球性議題，我們可以將它直接提升到聯合國大會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

659. I have a draft that Danny was kind enough that Antonio, we're preparing, I'll draft something based upon their work, try to get it done by tomorrow, and be very simple.
→ {"text": "我有一份草稿，丹尼很友善，還有安東尼奧，我們正在準備，我會根據他們的工作起草一些東西，試著在明天完成，而且會非常簡單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

660. I mean it's not going to be controversial, we've already talked about it, or I've raised it with my colleagues, and this is a given, you know, so we'll have something that not only the various members who have testified, members on our side of the table, and various members of the public may want to sign a petition adjoining this effort, and then hope that an organization, either the organization that did this, or I've talked a little bit with some others that have an organization that might want to take this up and follow through, raise the money to just get it, help get it to the New York, at probably the next session that could treat this would be next October, next September, next October, so, and I certainly myself would be happy to travel to New York and try to lobby for that, but it would take, we need a country to do it, and so it's up to you to see where you have the influence
→ {"text": "我的意思是這不會有爭議，我們已經討論過了，或者說我已經向我的同事提出過，這是既定事實，您知道的，所以我們會有一些東西，不僅各位作證的成員、我們這邊桌子的成員，以及公眾中的各位成員可能想簽署一份請願書支持這項努力，然後希望一個組織——要麼是做這件事的組織，或者我已經與其他一些有組織的人談過，他們可能想承接並跟進這件事，籌集資金，把它帶到紐約，可能在下一次會議上處理這件事，那將是明年十月，明年九月，明年十月，所以，我自己當然很樂意前往紐約並為此遊說，但這需要，我們需要一個國家來做，所以這取決於您，看您在哪裡有影響力", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

661. within your country to, and all we need is one, all we need is one, and that would be the sponsor, and I'm sure once you got one country with a sponsor, several other countries would follow suit and join on to it, so we could have a bevy of countries, and I think just to end on this time, I would guarantee that it would pass, because there's a lot of resentment in the General Assembly with respect to the conduct of the Security Council in a lot of other affairs.
→ {"text": "在您的國家內，我們只需要一個，我們只需要一個，那就是提案國，我相信一旦您得到一個提案國，其他幾個國家會跟進並加入，這樣我們就可以有一群國家，我認為就此結束時，我可以保證它會通過，因為聯合國大會對安全理事會在許多其他事務上的行為有很多不滿。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. I want to thank our panel today, you have been here, and appreciate your time and your effort and your willingness to speak up, and with that, we are adjourned. , thank you.
→ {"text": "我想感謝今天的專家小組，各位都在這裡，感謝各位撥冗出席、付出努力並願意發言，會議到此結束。謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
