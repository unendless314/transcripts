## Speaker Group 1

578. I have a couple of quick questions, hopefully.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

579. Anyone can answer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

580. I'd like to hear from all of you if we can do it in a short period of time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. What are the practical steps that we can do to take this issue forward, and is an international cooperative like the United Nations a possibility?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

582. Yes, there is a possibility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

583. You know that the Grenada resolution was simply frozen, and any member state of the United States could take this resolution and to put it into the agenda.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

584. Then we will have a vote from the United Nations, and we will see if by case this commission, permanent commission for UFOs in the United Nations, may be created or not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

585. Personally, I tried to do something with the San Marino Republic, which is a member state of the United Nations, but frankly, I had some problems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

586. We had some problems, because the first question they asked me is, "Okay, but what do you think the United States government may think about this?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

587. I have nothing else to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

588. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

589. Antonio?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. The UN, of course, would be excellent in my conversations with the different heads of the South American agencies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

591. They're eager, because they feel that they have these programs, which most of them have started recently, except Uruguay, who were the pioneers, but they have nowhere to report, so I mean, officially.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

592. Some place where the data could begin to be officially and legally marshalled in one single place, so that would be a step that would be excellent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

593. But the problem of the UN, it has to be a member state has to bring it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

594. In the case of Granada, Prime Minister Gairy was almost obsessed with the subject, so he had a mission, and he pursued it, as we know, for many years, until he was overthrown, because he wasn't taking care of the business in his own country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. He was spending so much time in New York that he was disregarding, even though he was the founding father of that island.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

596. Then, I don't know, it would be nice to have congressional hearings, but I appreciate your work here greatly, but with people who are currently in Congress, because then the oath, and then you could really bring officials, and by subpoena if necessary, and really try to get to the bottom of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

597. There's so much allegations and rumours, and probably half of those are false, and maybe the US government is getting a bad rep, but it's partly their own fault, because of so much secrecy, and we could, what is really happening in Area 51, have we incorporated some of this technology into weapons?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

598. There's all these kinds of allegations, but because we're dealing with classified areas, it's impossible to know, and so that would be another step.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

599. If the other countries of the world saw that there were hearings in the US and stuff like that, probably they would do the same, then it would give cover to a lot of other countries, even though many countries, as you know, are trying and are releasing files, and in South America especially, they're creating agencies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

600. Those would be two good steps, and they're probably others too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

601. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

602. Mr. Pope?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

603. The head of the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs attended a Royal Society discussion meeting in the UK in 2010.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

604. Now, I hasten to add that was an astrobiology meeting, and not a UFO meeting, but it did discuss in a speculative way some of the issues that might arise, be they religious, scientific, and technical, societal, if we did detect extraterrestrial life or even another civilization, but she said that when it comes to the role of the UN, one must approach the UN with consensus on this sort of issue, so I don't think there's much practical hope of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

605. On regard to your other question about practical steps that could be taken, I think one meaningful step would be to incorporate whatever you believe about UFOs, some module into pilot training, because whatever the government says or does about UFOs, civil and military pilots, do continue to see these things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

606. Great idea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

607. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

608. Mr. Cameron?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

609. I would agree with an international United Nations type thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

610. I don't think congressional will help, because it doesn't help anybody, it doesn't help you to get elected, which is what it's all about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

611. In terms of this week, I think we're no different than any other social or political movement, no matter how important we think we are, and when the time is right, it'll happen, and we have to keep making moves, and I think the move we've made this week to do this is a step ahead, so we are making steps.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

612. And it's like the women's right to vote, it started in 1848, they didn't get the right to vote until 1920, and even then their problems weren't solved.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

613. We're no different.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

614. We've got to make moves, we've got to put pressure on, that's how I think it's going to happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

615. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

616. Dr. Shelley?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

617. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

618. I've talked about, I'm trying to facilitate a summit meeting to talk about UFO and the universe, and universal exploration, and not only that, and we have, as a humankind, we've encountered many problems, probably in this summit, we'll be able to solve some of the difficulties.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

619. Now, we are trying to cohere the strength of all of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

620. Now, I'm trying to form a committee of the thinkers of our world, and try to gather all the intellectuals around the world together, and also that we should come to a conclusion on all the cases, and a few years ago, some experts, that some of the people that advised that Senator Goldwater, whether he could conduct investigation or promote investigation of the Area 51, he did not believe about this Area 51, and I was very honored he invited me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

621. So, we had a small group formed, and Senator Goldwater was a chair, and it was a co-chair, and then, regretfully, he was quite old at the time, and he went to the hospital, so he asked his secretary to apologize for me, for the success of this forming a group, so you can see that for such a prestigious person to be involved in the investigation, if we can get somebody like that, we will come to a fruitful conclusion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

622. This is a very major event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

623. If, after the investigation, and we come to a conclusion that there is no UFO or ET, then that's fine, but if we can verify there is actually UFO and ET, that's great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

624. Mr. Pinotti, you already gave your answer to this one, didn't you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

625. Excuse me?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

626. Did you give your answer to this question?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

627. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

628. I think you did, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

629. You started.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

630. The problem of interacting on international level, and having the possibility to bring this argument to the attention of United Nations and so on, is a big one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

631. I think that, probably, little nations may be more interested.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

632. Big nations may have big problems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

633. In fact, as I told you before, I tried to move something with the Little Republic of San Marino, since this could be extremely simple.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

634. But there are problems, because you see, for instance, in Italy, even if we have an official UFO group in the Italian Air Force, we have the facts, but we have no study, in the sense that our military say, we are all involved in defense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

635. That's all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

636. We don't like to draw any conclusion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

637. If we still have this attitude at the political level, everywhere, we will not be able to do anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

638. I think that we must change our mentality, our way of thinking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

639. We should be aware of the fact that we are facing something absolutely new and absolutely real and absolutely from outside.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

640. Don't remember that the first UFO sightings occurred in Europe, and particularly in Italy, in the '30s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

641. They were advanced, intelligent, piloted crafts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

642. They were studied by the fascist government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

643. We knew this up to some years ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

644. But if this is true, and this is true, this means that these objects do not come from the Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

645. They come from outside the Earth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

646. And if this is true, we should be aware that we are facing an historical argument.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

647. We are still discussing, and from a sociological point of view, I think that we are not too different from the cargo cult people who spoke in the Pacific after World War II about the passing airplanes, and that they thought they were some kind of divine means and so on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

648. Apart from this, we do not know the origin of this intelligence and of these crafts, but what is sure that we are sufficiently lucky that this intelligence are not hostile, and this is not too much, frankly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

649. What we should do, I think, is just to be aware of this and to try to understand more, but all together.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

650. Otherwise, if we still continue to be separated state by state, we won't do any conclusion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

651. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

652. Senator Gravel, you have three minutes left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

653. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

654. Going along with your recommendations, I had suggested earlier that, and I think Mr. Cameron has shared that same view, is that another hearing, whether it's like this one or whether it's in the Congress, probably won't advance our goals all that much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

655. But there's no reason why, with the various countries represented here, with the various scholars and military officers, that we would try to, within our own communities, to get them to endorse a resolution, a very simple, straightforward resolution, calling upon the General Assembly, not get waylaid to the Security Council, because that's a dead letter also, but to take the matter to the General Assembly, all we would need is one country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

656. But I think that we have several countries from South America, and certainly this group here might have enough influence to get their government to go on record and to field a resolution creating an agency of the United Nations without a lot of powers defined, but specifically with the goal to organize a global conference, not a hearing, a global conference of the scholars and scientists and whoever that would come together, and to fund it both from public and private sources, so that within a couple of years we could convene a conference that would command the attention of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

657. I have no doubt, and I at one point in my career was a delegate to the United Nations from the Senate for four months, and I have no doubt that we could field that kind of a resolution and get it adopted, and then it would be the responsibility, or that would be the aegis of it all that would carry it forward, and then we could all have something now to hang our hats on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

658. Right now we're hanging our hat on the fine work that has been putting together this particular conference, but we can elevate it one notch higher, and not one notch higher, I mean we can elevate it right to where it really belongs, because it's a global issue, we could elevate it right to the General Assembly of the United Nations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

659. I have a draft that Danny was kind enough that Antonio, we're preparing, I'll draft something based upon their work, try to get it done by tomorrow, and be very simple.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

660. I mean it's not going to be controversial, we've already talked about it, or I've raised it with my colleagues, and this is a given, you know, so we'll have something that not only the various members who have testified, members on our side of the table, and various members of the public may want to sign a petition adjoining this effort, and then hope that an organization, either the organization that did this, or I've talked a little bit with some others that have an organization that might want to take this up and follow through, raise the money to just get it, help get it to the New York, at probably the next session that could treat this would be next October, next September, next October, so, and I certainly myself would be happy to travel to New York and try to lobby for that, but it would take, we need a country to do it, and so it's up to you to see where you have the influence
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

661. within your country to, and all we need is one, all we need is one, and that would be the sponsor, and I'm sure once you got one country with a sponsor, several other countries would follow suit and join on to it, so we could have a bevy of countries, and I think just to end on this time, I would guarantee that it would pass, because there's a lot of resentment in the General Assembly with respect to the conduct of the Security Council in a lot of other affairs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

662. I want to thank our panel today, you have been here, and appreciate your time and your effort and your willingness to speak up, and with that, we are adjourned. , thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
