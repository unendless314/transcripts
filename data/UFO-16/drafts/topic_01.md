→ {"text": "我們要開始了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. The meeting will come to order.
→ {"text": "會議現在開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. I want to thank the panel for being back again.
→ {"text": "我要感謝各位專家再次出席。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

4. This is terrific having the kind of international panel we have had today, this morning, this afternoon.
→ {"text": "今天上午到下午能有這樣的國際專家小組，實在太好了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

5. The fact is sometimes we only think about ourselves as opposed to what's happening in the world.
→ {"text": "事實上，我們有時只想到自己，而非世界上正在發生的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

6. So I appreciate you being here.
→ {"text": "所以我很感謝各位的到來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. We all appreciate you being here and thank you for your time and your patience.
→ {"text": "我們都很感謝各位的出席，感謝各位撥冗前來並耐心等候。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. And with that, we will start with this panel.
→ {"text": "那麼，我們將開始這場專家小組問答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. This is a chance for you to ask questions in depth.
→ {"text": "這是各位深入提問的機會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. And if we are good about it, we can go two rounds.
→ {"text": "如果我們掌握得好，可以進行兩輪提問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. You'll each have 12 minutes.
→ {"text": "各位每人有12分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

12. So if you take all 12 at once, that's okay.
→ {"text": "所以如果你一次用完12分鐘，沒問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

13. If you want to take six and then six later, you can do that.
→ {"text": "如果你想先用6分鐘，之後再用6分鐘，也可以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. So I'll try to keep track of that or you can help me keep track of that.
→ {"text": "我會試著計時，或者你們可以幫忙計時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. And do I have anyone that would like to start?
→ {"text": "有哪位想先開始提問嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. I'll start.
→ {"text": "我先開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. All right, Ms. Woolsey, Representative Woolsey.
→ {"text": "好的，伍爾西女士，伍爾西眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. So my question is to each of you, if the United States becomes more transparent, releases files, and is more open about this situation, the United States government, would that be a help or a hindrance to your country and our relationships with you and why and how?
→ {"text": "我要問各位，如果美國政府在這個議題上變得更透明、公開檔案、更開放，這對貴國以及我們與貴國的關係，會是幫助還是阻礙？為什麼？如何影響？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. Start down there.
→ {"text": "從那邊開始。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. Well, first of all, I'd like to clarify for the record, because a lot of people have a misconception that all these other countries have been wonderful and released all these files and the U.S. has released nothing, which is totally not true.
→ {"text": "首先，我想澄清一點並列入記錄，因為很多人有個誤解，認為其他國家都很好，公開了所有檔案，而美國什麼都沒公開，這完全不是事實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. I mean, you yourselves have been dealing with American governments like the documents like the one about Peru and things like that.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，各位自己也處理過美國政府的文件，像是關於祕魯的那份文件之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. So the U.S. was actually the first country to release UFO files, just for the record, I want to make that.
→ {"text": "所以美國其實是第一個公開UFO檔案的國家，我想把這一點列入記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. It doesn't mean that they've released, you know, hardware or final conclusions.
→ {"text": "這不代表他們公開了硬體證據或最終結論。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. I mean, I'm not saying they've released everything they have.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我並不是說他們公開了所有資料。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. But it was the law.
→ {"text": "但這是法律規定的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. You know, the Freedom of Information Act, as you know, had been amended as a result of the Watergate scandal where you could sue the government, and then it occurred to some people that because there had been these rumors that the CIA and other agencies had been involved in ufology.
→ {"text": "如各位所知，資訊自由法（Freedom of Information Act）在水門事件後經過修正，允許人民起訴政府，然後有些人想到，既然一直有傳聞說CIA和其他機構涉及UFO研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

28. For years, the U.S. had said that only Blue Book, that's the only thing they had ever done about UFOs.
→ {"text": "多年來，美國一直聲稱只有藍皮書計畫（Blue Book），那是他們在UFO方面唯一做過的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. So there was a famous lawsuit around 1977 against the CIA for their files on UFOs because there was many indications that they had done this thing called the Robertson Panel in 1953, a scientific conference on UFOs.
→ {"text": "所以在1977年左右，有一場著名的訴訟案，起訴CIA公開UFO檔案，因為有很多跡象顯示他們在1953年舉辦過一場叫做羅伯森調查小組（Robertson Panel）的UFO科學會議。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. And there was a group forum called Citizens Against UFO Secrecy back in those days.
→ {"text": "當時有個組織叫做反UFO保密公民組織（Citizens Against UFO Secrecy，簡稱CAUS）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

31. I know this story very well because that's when I was getting started as a journalist in the subject, and they sued the CIA, you know, because the law had been amended and now you could -- in the old days, you were at the mercy of the government, like the British used to be, too, until they passed the similar law where basically the government would release what they pleased and you had no recourse.
→ {"text": "我很清楚這段故事，因為那正是我開始從事這個主題的新聞報導工作的時候。他們起訴了CIA，因為法律已經修正，現在人民可以這麼做了——在過去，你只能任由政府擺布，英國以前也是這樣，直到他們通過類似的法律之前，基本上政府想公開什麼就公開什麼，你毫無辦法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. But after Watergate, they amended that law.
→ {"text": "但在水門事件之後，他們修正了那條法律。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. And so this group sued the CIA, and the CIA knew that they were going to lose the case because there was enough evidence about at least the Robertson Panel.
→ {"text": "於是這個組織起訴了CIA，而CIA知道他們會輸掉官司，因為至少關於羅伯森調查小組的證據已經足夠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. So rather than go to court and be humiliated by a judge, they decided to, you know, cut their losses and they released 1,000 pages of documents.
→ {"text": "所以與其上法庭被法官羞辱，他們決定止損，公開了1，000頁文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. And that made huge front-page stories.
→ {"text": "這成了重大的頭版新聞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. I mean, it was on the New York Times, on the Washington Post.
→ {"text": "我是說，紐約時報、華盛頓郵報都報導了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. It was a big story at the time.
→ {"text": "當時是個大新聞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. But now there's kind of an amnesia, you know, within -- and this -- partly the UFO community themselves are guilty for this because it's kind of politically correct to always criticize the U.S. government and say that the foreign governments are great.
→ {"text": "但現在似乎有種失憶症，而且UFO社群本身也對此有責任，因為批評美國政府、讚揚外國政府似乎在政治上比較正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. Well, it's the same thing.
→ {"text": "嗯，其實都差不多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. I mean, the Russians, sure, have released some things.
→ {"text": "我是說，俄羅斯當然公開了一些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. Have they released everything?
→ {"text": "他們公開了一切嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. No.
→ {"text": "沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. And the same, you know, maybe some of the smaller countries might have released everything because they have less, you know, less complex programs.
→ {"text": "同樣地，也許有些較小的國家公開了一切，因為他們的計畫比較不複雜。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. So I wanted to get that on the record on this hearing.
→ {"text": "所以我想在這場聽證會上把這一點列入記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. And then that was followed by the FBI that released their files with -- they're currently in a thing called the Vault, and they're online.
→ {"text": "接著是FBI公開了他們的檔案——目前在一個叫做FBI文件庫（The Vault）的網站上，可以線上查閱。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. And then the Defense Intelligence Agency and everything.
→ {"text": "然後是國防情報局等等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. And so the U.S. government has released stuff, but there's still a lot of gaps.
→ {"text": "所以美國政府確實公開了一些資料，但仍有很多缺口。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. I think we definitely would be helpful for everybody that everybody releases just about everything, unless it was something of truly national security that would affect that country.
→ {"text": "我認為如果各國公開幾乎所有資料，對大家都有幫助，除非是真正涉及國家安全、會影響該國的事項。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

49. But otherwise, too much secrecy doesn't help anybody.
→ {"text": "但除此之外，過度保密對任何人都沒有幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. Good.
→ {"text": "很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. Thank you very much, Mr. -- we -- I figure we've got two, four, six, eight minutes left.
→ {"text": "非常感謝，先生——我們——我算一下還有二、四、六、八分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. If you can kind of think in two-minute segments, I'd appreciate it.
→ {"text": "如果各位能以兩分鐘為單位思考發言，我會很感激。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. Ma'am, as my colleague has indicated, my understanding certainly is that the U.S. government's public position is that it has already disclosed its files.
→ {"text": "女士，如我的同僚所言，我的理解確實是美國政府的公開立場就是他們已經公開了檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. I'm not aware, given that the U.K. government is nearly complete with its process of releasing this material, that any further releases from America would either harm or help our U.K. process.
→ {"text": "鑑於英國政府公開這些資料的程序已接近完成，我不認為美國進一步公開資料會對我們英國的程序造成傷害或幫助。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

56. Will.
→ {"text": "威爾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. I would agree, especially with Antonio, that I believe the Americans have sort of got bad rap in this deal, that basically everybody in the world is just releasing sighting files.
→ {"text": "我同意，特別是同意安東尼奧的說法，我認為美國人在這件事上有點被冤枉了，因為基本上全世界各國公開的都只是目擊檔案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. Everybody's releasing file files, the real files, the ones we want to see.
→ {"text": "沒有人公開真正的檔案，我們想看的那種檔案。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文'file files'疑似為'hiding files'的轉錄錯誤，但依原文翻譯"}

59. So the Americans have done that.
→ {"text": "所以美國人也是這樣做的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. In fact, I believe, maybe one of the few researchers who have written on this, that the American government is actually leaking parts of the story, using disinformation to cover it.
→ {"text": "事實上，我相信——或許我是少數撰文論述這點的研究者之一——美國政府其實在洩漏部分真相，用假情報來掩飾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

61. But I don't think it's really going to affect the rest of the world.
→ {"text": "但我不認為這會真的影響世界其他地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. I think everybody is waiting for the Americans.
→ {"text": "我認為大家都在等美國人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. The Americans are running the show, and everybody's waiting for the Americans to make the first move.
→ {"text": "美國人在主導這一切，大家都在等美國人先行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

64. I think that if we can make everything public, and such a high tech is going to be shared by all humankind in the world, this is a very good thing.
→ {"text": "我認為如果我們能把一切公諸於世，而這類高科技將由全人類共享，這是非常好的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

65. However, generally speaking, that through our work, and if we disclose all those UFO information or ET information, it's going to benefit the whole humankind.
→ {"text": "然而，一般而言，透過我們的工作，如果我們公開所有UFO資訊或外星資訊，將造福全人類。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. However, every government considers UFOs as top secrets of defense secrets, defense classification, and all the national security.
→ {"text": "然而，每個政府都將UFO視為最高機密、國防機密、國防分類以及國家安全議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. If they treat the issues as UFO issues, purely UFO issues, that would be much easier.
→ {"text": "如果他們把這些議題當作UFO議題，純粹的UFO議題來處理，會容易得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. Otherwise, it's going to be very difficult.
→ {"text": "否則會非常困難。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

69. Since Europe, Russia, Latin America, the Vatican, even China, which has an open attitude, after all have some kind of disclosure attitude, why should the United States of America be different?
→ {"text": "既然歐洲、俄羅斯、拉丁美洲、梵蒂岡，甚至持開放態度的中國，畢竟都有某種真相揭露的態度，為什麼美利堅合眾國要與眾不同？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

70. There is a definite reason from an historical point of view.
→ {"text": "從歷史觀點來看，確實有其原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

71. Surely as the most important world power, the United States feel a particular responsibility, and they surely fear that the UFO problem may cause a sort of uncontrollable reaction in the general public.
→ {"text": "作為最重要的世界強權，美國肯定感到一種特殊的責任，他們肯定擔心UFO問題可能在公眾中引起某種無法控制的反應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

72. So this is a possible explanation for the cover-up, for this conspiracy of silence, if you like.
→ {"text": "所以這可能是真相掩蓋的解釋，如果你願意這麼說，這種沉默共謀的解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. But I'm sure that since there is no longer the possibility to uncover all these subjects, the United States will be obliged in the next future to do something.
→ {"text": "但我確信，既然已經不可能再掩蓋這些事情，美國在不久的將來將被迫採取行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. Those consider that the world power, who will have the courage to say things as they were, will be considered much more than all the others.
→ {"text": "那些認為世界強權若有勇氣如實陳述事情真相，將比其他所有國家更受重視。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文語法略顯混亂，盡力保持原意"}

75. And probably this is not yet understood.
→ {"text": "而這一點可能尚未被理解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. And when this may happen, probably the United States may have something positive for themselves.
→ {"text": "當這發生時，美國可能會為自己帶來一些正面的結果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

77. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. And with that, Madam Chair, I will reserve the balance of my time.
→ {"text": "主席女士，我保留剩餘的時間。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
