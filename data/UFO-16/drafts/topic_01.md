## Speaker Group 1

1. We are going to get started.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

2. The meeting will come to order.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

3. I want to thank the panel for being back again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

4. This is terrific having the kind of international panel we have had today, this morning, this afternoon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

5. The fact is sometimes we only think about ourselves as opposed to what's happening in the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

6. So I appreciate you being here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

7. We all appreciate you being here and thank you for your time and your patience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

8. And with that, we will start with this panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. This is a chance for you to ask questions in depth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. And if we are good about it, we can go two rounds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. You'll each have 12 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. So if you take all 12 at once, that's okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. If you want to take six and then six later, you can do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. So I'll try to keep track of that or you can help me keep track of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. And do I have anyone that would like to start?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. I'll start.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. All right, Ms. Woolsey, Representative Woolsey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. So my question is to each of you, if the United States becomes more transparent, releases files, and is more open about this situation, the United States government, would that be a help or a hindrance to your country and our relationships with you and why and how?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. Start down there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. Well, first of all, I'd like to clarify for the record, because a lot of people have a misconception that all these other countries have been wonderful and released all these files and the U.S. has released nothing, which is totally not true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. I mean, you yourselves have been dealing with American governments like the documents like the one about Peru and things like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. So the U.S. was actually the first country to release UFO files, just for the record, I want to make that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. It doesn't mean that they've released, you know, hardware or final conclusions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. I mean, I'm not saying they've released everything they have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. But it was the law.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. You know, the Freedom of Information Act, as you know, had been amended as a result of the Watergate scandal where you could sue the government, and then it occurred to some people that because there had been these rumors that the CIA and other agencies had been involved in ufology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. For years, the U.S. had said that only Blue Book, that's the only thing they had ever done about UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. So there was a famous lawsuit around 1977 against the CIA for their files on UFOs because there was many indications that they had done this thing called the Robertson Panel in 1953, a scientific conference on UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. And there was a group forum called Citizens Against UFO Secrecy back in those days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. I know this story very well because that's when I was getting started as a journalist in the subject, and they sued the CIA, you know, because the law had been amended and now you could -- in the old days, you were at the mercy of the government, like the British used to be, too, until they passed the similar law where basically the government would release what they pleased and you had no recourse.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. But after Watergate, they amended that law.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. And so this group sued the CIA, and the CIA knew that they were going to lose the case because there was enough evidence about at least the Robertson Panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. So rather than go to court and be humiliated by a judge, they decided to, you know, cut their losses and they released 1,000 pages of documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. And that made huge front-page stories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. I mean, it was on the New York Times, on the Washington Post.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. It was a big story at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. But now there's kind of an amnesia, you know, within -- and this -- partly the UFO community themselves are guilty for this because it's kind of politically correct to always criticize the U.S. government and say that the foreign governments are great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. Well, it's the same thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. I mean, the Russians, sure, have released some things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. Have they released everything?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. And the same, you know, maybe some of the smaller countries might have released everything because they have less, you know, less complex programs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. So I wanted to get that on the record on this hearing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. And then that was followed by the FBI that released their files with -- they're currently in a thing called the Vault, and they're online.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. And then the Defense Intelligence Agency and everything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. And so the U.S. government has released stuff, but there's still a lot of gaps.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. I think we definitely would be helpful for everybody that everybody releases just about everything, unless it was something of truly national security that would affect that country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. But otherwise, too much secrecy doesn't help anybody.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. Good.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. Thank you very much, Mr. -- we -- I figure we've got two, four, six, eight minutes left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. If you can kind of think in two-minute segments, I'd appreciate it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. Ma'am, as my colleague has indicated, my understanding certainly is that the U.S. government's public position is that it has already disclosed its files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. I'm not aware, given that the U.K. government is nearly complete with its process of releasing this material, that any further releases from America would either harm or help our U.K. process.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. Will.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. I would agree, especially with Antonio, that I believe the Americans have sort of got bad rap in this deal, that basically everybody in the world is just releasing sighting files.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. Everybody's releasing file files, the real files, the ones we want to see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. So the Americans have done that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. In fact, I believe, maybe one of the few researchers who have written on this, that the American government is actually leaking parts of the story, using disinformation to cover it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. But I don't think it's really going to affect the rest of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. I think everybody is waiting for the Americans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. The Americans are running the show, and everybody's waiting for the Americans to make the first move.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. I think that if we can make everything public, and such a high tech is going to be shared by all humankind in the world, this is a very good thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. However, generally speaking, that through our work, and if we disclose all those UFO information or ET information, it's going to benefit the whole humankind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. However, every government considers UFOs as top secrets of defense secrets, defense classification, and all the national security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. If they treat the issues as UFO issues, purely UFO issues, that would be much easier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. Otherwise, it's going to be very difficult.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

69. Since Europe, Russia, Latin America, the Vatican, even China, which has an open attitude, after all have some kind of disclosure attitude, why should the United States of America be different?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

70. There is a definite reason from an historical point of view.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

71. Surely as the most important world power, the United States feel a particular responsibility, and they surely fear that the UFO problem may cause a sort of uncontrollable reaction in the general public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. So this is a possible explanation for the cover-up, for this conspiracy of silence, if you like.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. But I'm sure that since there is no longer the possibility to uncover all these subjects, the United States will be obliged in the next future to do something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. Those consider that the world power, who will have the courage to say things as they were, will be considered much more than all the others.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. And probably this is not yet understood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. And when this may happen, probably the United States may have something positive for themselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. And with that, Madam Chair, I will reserve the balance of my time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
