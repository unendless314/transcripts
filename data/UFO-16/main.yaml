    high-level people, like admirals and generals and General Abramson, the head of

    the United Nations from the Senate for four months, and I have no doubt that we
    could field that kind of a resolution and get it adopted, and then it would be
    the responsibility, or that would be the aegis of it all that would carry it forward,
    and then we could all have something now to hang our hats on.

  source_text: Right now we're hanging our hat on the fine work that has been putting
    together this particular conference, but we can elevate it one notch higher, and
    not one notch higher, I mean we can elevate it right to where it really belongs,
    because it's a global issue, we could elevate it right to the General Assembly
    of the United Nations.

    that might want to take this up and follow through, raise the money to just get
    it, help get it to the New York, at probably the next session that could treat
    this would be next October, next September, next October, so, and I certainly
    myself would be happy to travel to New York and try to lobby for that, but it

    have the influence
