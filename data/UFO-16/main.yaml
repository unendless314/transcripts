    sued the CIA, you know, because the law had been amended and now you could -- in the old days, you were at the mercy of
    the government, like the British used to be, too, until they passed the similar law where basically the government would
    release what they pleased and you had no recourse.

  source_text: But there's no reason why, with the various countries represented here, with the various scholars and military
    officers, that we would try to, within our own communities, to get them to endorse a resolution, a very simple, straightforward
    resolution, calling upon the General Assembly, not get waylaid to the Security Council, because that's a dead letter also,
    but to take the matter to the General Assembly, all we would need is one country.

  source_text: But I think that we have several countries from South America, and certainly this group here might have enough
    influence to get their government to go on record and to field a resolution creating an agency of the United Nations without
    a lot of powers defined, but specifically with the goal to organize a global conference, not a hearing, a global conference
    of the scholars and scientists and whoever that would come together, and to fund it both from public and private sources,
    so that within a couple of years we could convene a conference that would command the attention of the world.

  source_text: I have no doubt, and I at one point in my career was a delegate to the United Nations from the Senate for four
    months, and I have no doubt that we could field that kind of a resolution and get it adopted, and then it would be the
    responsibility, or that would be the aegis of it all that would carry it forward, and then we could all have something
    now to hang our hats on.

  source_text: Right now we're hanging our hat on the fine work that has been putting together this particular conference,
    but we can elevate it one notch higher, and not one notch higher, I mean we can elevate it right to where it really belongs,
    because it's a global issue, we could elevate it right to the General Assembly of the United Nations.

  source_text: I mean it's not going to be controversial, we've already talked about it, or I've raised it with my colleagues,
    and this is a given, you know, so we'll have something that not only the various members who have testified, members on
    our side of the table, and various members of the public may want to sign a petition adjoining this effort, and then hope
    that an organization, either the organization that did this, or I've talked a little bit with some others that have an
    organization that might want to take this up and follow through, raise the money to just get it, help get it to the New
    York, at probably the next session that could treat this would be next October, next September, next October, so, and
    I certainly myself would be happy to travel to New York and try to lobby for that, but it would take, we need a country
    to do it, and so it's up to you to see where you have the influence

  source_text: within your country to, and all we need is one, all we need is one, and that would be the sponsor, and I'm
    sure once you got one country with a sponsor, several other countries would follow suit and join on to it, so we could
    have a bevy of countries, and I think just to end on this time, I would guarantee that it would pass, because there's
    a lot of resentment in the General Assembly with respect to the conduct of the Security Council in a lot of other affairs.
