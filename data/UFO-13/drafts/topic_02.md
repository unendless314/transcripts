→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. Now I will begin by saying that just two weeks ago, this time, we had a meeting between Brazilian civilian UFO researchers, six of us of the Brazilian Committee of UFO Researchers, with members of the armed forces, 10 personnel from Army, Air Force, and Navy at the Ministry of Defense of Brazil.

103. Now, it was given to us at this time a promise that we, the civilian UFO researchers, will have a clear, unobstructed channel of communication with our armored forces through the Ministry of Defense, because they are subordinated to the Ministry of Defense.

104. It was also granted to us the promise that more papers and documents will be disclosed in the near future.

105. We're talking about June, maybe July, that some hundred new pages of UFO documents will be released.

106. Now, for those of you who don't have the details of it, let me tell you that Brazil has been involved officially in the investigation of the UFO phenomena for decades.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. Actually, it was one of the first countries in the world to officially admit that we are being visited by extraterrestrial powers, extraterrestrial civilization.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. It took place in 1954 in Rio de Janeiro when it was assembled, one gathering among military, top-ranking military from the Brazilian Air Force and members of the press and the society, and it was declared that the UFO phenomena is very serious, worth of scrutiny, and has to be fully investigated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. That was in 1954, and from that moment on, Brazil has been involved in several projects, have held several projects mainly from the Brazilian Air Force to investigate it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. We had in 1969 a body that was created inside the Brazilian Air Force to investigate the subject and it was called System for the Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Objects (SICOANI), so any, it was spread all over the country using all the installations of the Brazilian Air Force and it had conducted dozens of investigations all over, including of sightings of UFOs, chasing of aircrafts, landing of UFOs, including with extraterrestrial entities, extraterrestrial biologic entities outside the crafts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. It was all documented in an official way by the Brazilian Air Force from 1969 to 1972.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. Now, a decade later, or two decades later, a decade later in 1977, we have had another very important program to investigate this phenomena in the Amazon, and in a particular area in the Amazon where the UFO phenomena was being observed by the inhabitants, especially of an island called Colares.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. The situation was so intense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. The UFOs was being observed all over that island and in large portions of the Amazon region that the Brazilian Air Force put together a committee of members to investigate the phenomena officially, and it was called Operation Saucer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. Operation Saucer lasted from September 1977 to December 1977.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. It interviewed hundreds of people that were in contact with this phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. But more than that, it was the purpose of the Operation Saucer, first, to talk to the witnesses to see what are their reports, second, to try to document the presence of this phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. And over 500 pictures of UFO were produced, along with 16 hours of video, actually of footage and film, 8 millimeters and 16 millimeters, military-style films of UFOs in the Amazon, sometimes at close range.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. And the third objective of the Operation Saucer, and this is official from the Brazilian Air Force, was try to establish contact with intelligences beyond this phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. This is all very intense. 2,000 pages have been produced by 3,000 men who took part in this operation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. I was the one chosen by the commander of this operation 20 years after it was ended to interview him, and he gave me with a huge amount of details what went on in that period of time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. Since then, I have been chasing the information about Operation Saucer in UFOs in Amazon forever and everywhere I could find.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. And I'm glad to bring, and I would like to get introduced to this proceeding results, 440 pages, which is 20 percent of what there is, of official UFO documents from the Brazilian Air Force that register, including with photos, maps, radar detects, croquis, designs, all sorts of information related to the UFOs in the Amazon, and lots of this procedure were followed by American military in the Amazon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. Thank you very much.
