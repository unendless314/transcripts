227. This commission was created to analyze all the cases before it was created and all the new cases that were coming up and being reported.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

228. Some problems were also faced to find conclusions that would be valid to apply to all the research.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. The first problem was how can we investigate?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

230. The second problem was how to evaluate something that we don't know what it is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. So the decision was to opt a discussion that was open without prejudice or bias to explore the phenomena, to analyze all the studies that will be able to compile all the reports and all the events.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

232. First we started to study the UFOs first and the non-identified objects and anything that relates with it, like the territory, the people, any effects, any objects, animals, or anything that could be in relation to this UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. And all the revelations that people had been reporting, whether it was spiritual or mystic, we found out that it was a phenomenon that could absorb different opinions and different phenomena together into one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. Why was this occurring?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. This phenomenon was absolutely unknown, that was presented and causing a lot of difficulties to study, having the spirit of curiosity and investigation to adjust our studies into the scientific responsibility and a methodology of research to be adequate for this research and evaluation to a qualification of the systems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

236. Two pillars were the basis, the recollection of the information collected and the study of the comparative events in the phenomena, the questions asked, where we have people that will interrogate all the details and make conclusions, what possibilities it is that the testimony is not true, and the third, people that would have seen the events.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

237. What is the possibility to be a psychological illusion, the questions were negative or partial or there was any doubt that was reasonable to corroborate with the scientific research.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

238. What is the possibility that this phenomena is not conventional?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. We don't know what it is, but we can also identify the methodology had a possibility of percentage that we don't know what it is and cannot identify, we cannot tell what it is, and we cannot identify with anything known or conventional.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

240. Finally, to evaluate all this information, we have a system that will give us the opportunity to corroborate the veracity and filter all the details that we can submit to work together with international groups to work together and our model of organization I would like to offer our methodology of working to create an office to study this subject and we can submit on the United Nations so we can, together with the rest of the world, lift the veil and find out the exact details of what this phenomena is.
