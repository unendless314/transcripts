246. My name is Anthony Choi.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. I'm going to read my declaration.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. I am a lawyer and a media reporter for investigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. I am the main investigator of the non-identified objects and I have attended the Area War School of Peru and Space for Peru.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. I am the main investigator for the official UFO research of Peru, founded on 1st November on 1971.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. I have been investigating for 13 years this phenomena in Peru and I have also a radio program in Peru which is one of the most important in Pan America.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. I would like to go, please, to image number one, please, around 7 p.m. on 13th of October 2001 in the skies of this city.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

253. There's a city where there is a strange light.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. This is north of Peru with the frontier with Ecuador.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. We're going to see the image number two, eight light spheres appear and then on the right side up here you'll see intense lights.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. Color is orange and dozens of witnesses have observed this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. These lights have been for two and a half hours, absolutely in silence and forming figures that were geometric alignments, so somehow they were giving a light show for all the witnesses and then suddenly disappeared. 25th of October, another luminous object about 25 meters of diameter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

258. We can see one of the witnesses pointing to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. Site number six, please, appears hovering in the sky and the city was accompanied by another spheres of light, one of which landed, quote, unquote, so it landed in a nearby hillside.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. The whole view lasted 26 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. This is part of a video that we extracted these images from the video.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. That's when he landed the witnesses unanimously.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. They had heard a greeting on their head.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. It was like a greeting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. They heard, hello.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. And lastly, on November 15th, another red luminous sphere descended on the same city, which after a few minutes, it disappeared.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. These events, we should note, were recorded on three videos, copies of which we are turning over to the committee so that you can look at them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. They were recorded by Iván Ascanio Fajardo, who was a cameraman from that community, and I asked him for a copy so that I could begin my respective investigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. In the media, the case was called the Chulucanas incident, and the videos were turned over to the Peruvian Air Force and given to Peruvian Air Force Commander Julio Chamorro-Flores, who is the chief of the Peruvian Air Force's UFO investigation office.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. He instructed me to proceed with my investigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. The investigation was able to document statements from dozens of witnesses.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. However, they were also able to confirm a very significant event, most of which were unfamiliar to people around the world, and this is something that many investigators need to know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. South America, perhaps right now, is the area where there are the largest number of sightings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. It is surprising how the world, even the United States of America, are unaware of this situation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. I think much of this has to do with the role of the media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. And just as a matter of example, I'm going to point out a few of these cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. In 1959, during a military training flight of a squadron of four P-47 planes near the city of Chulucanas, Peruvian Air Force Captain Ernesto Arancivia Linares had an encounter with a UFO that shut down his plane's engine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. It was hovering in the air for an hour, and during which time Captain Arancivia states that he had an encounter and communication with the alleged crew members who, based on his testimony, official testimony, seemed to be humans with Nordic features.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. Captain Arancivia reported this to his command, but his command never made this public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. Okay, can we see slides nine and ten?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. This is retired Captain Arancivia right now, and this is an illustration that he drew, his description of this UFO that he saw hovering in the air for an hour.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. And now we'll see our slide number 11.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. In 2002, during a nighttime military training flight in the area close to Moropon, very close to Chulucanas, Peruvian Air Force Captain Germán Shrock Castillo and another pilot, after receiving a report from a commercial flight and flying at an altitude of 12,000 feet, detected an unexplainable, perfect circle outlined by fire of an immense diameter of between 15 and 18 kilometers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. No explanation for that phenomenon could be found, nor was this ever revealed to the public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. In 2004, and now we'll see image number 12, a team from the Univision Television Network in Denver, Colorado, traveled to the area to work on a news report on UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. And on August 6th of that year, at approximately 1.33 a.m., this team was able to record a video of a strange object flying over Cerro Pilán.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. The Colonel José Ratti from FAP Airspace Director of Peru, representing the Peru Air Force, the first officer officially of a case that was recognized to all media of communications.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. The initiative, we must recognize the courage action of Peru Air Force to dedicate time to open up this information, being the third in Latin America group to report these incidents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. The city of Chulucan, their chiefs of this report have been inexplicably stolen and are missing from FAP, the official UFO reporting agency in Peru, in regards to this UFO case.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. The city of Chulucan, the first official investigation of a case of UFO to be disclosed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. The archives have been missing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. We're going to see image number 18, the testimony of the people seeing all these events in Peru.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. It's mostly on the Peruvian territory, very, very, very long history of my country, Peru.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. In Cusco, this is a photograph that's been taken.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. This is a very significant event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. Peru is one of the six places that for 6,000 years that we have human inhabitation, the Mayas ancestry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. That exists also evidence that there is pilots that have encounters in space.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. That they have shown a completely unknown performance in the airspace.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. That they have been turned down for informing anything in regards to this event. 1980s, my colleagues and I, we commence studying these events.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. My presence here is to confront that the United States and other regions of the world are not willing to acknowledge this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. But this requires a global response in regards to the research of this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. These events and these UFOs that are originating out of the Earthly space and the performance of these non-identified objects and phenomena and the citizens that are reporting witnessing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. We are in front of one of the most important mysteries of the contemporary time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. This is a simple and powerful event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. The interaction with other civilizations of the world and learning about our visitors.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. They are influencing our society in present times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. We are immersed in the process of preparation to open up all these phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. It's about 60 years that this phenomenon has been studied in my country, but the governments are protectionists or interested in not disclosing the information pertaining to this phenomenon of unidentified objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. And also, the reporters, they are abandoning the spirit of research instead of reporting the real truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. But in our planet, we have an obligation to comment about this and research.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. We are sharing with other civilizations that are of world in the main time the healing of our community in regards to this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
