## Speaker Group 1

361. And then we have Alejandro Chionetti.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. Welcome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. Well it is a great honor to be here with you, members of Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. I do not represent any official Argentinian group.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. I am a news producer for the third largest Spanish channel here in the United States and have been here for many years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. But despite that, I have not stopped investigating my dear country of Argentina, and I thank you for this great invitation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. I am happy to be here on behalf of Argentina and other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. So these UFO investigation projects are nothing new in my life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. As an investigative reporter and field researcher, I have investigated many cases that were investigated before and after the event by official groups or through subsequent historical reviews.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. From my very early childhood, I was a part of a civil investigation group that sought cooperation with official entities and we, the special and noble species called UFOlogists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. In the 1980s, my group, the UFO Investigations Commission, or CU as it is known, which is directed by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who is a recognized astronomer and advisor to the Blue Book Project, chose us as representatives of this organization as editors of its bulletin in Spanish in the International UFO Report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. At that time, Heineck was seeking international exchange and the timing was perfect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. We brought him to the National Commission for Space Studies, called NIE, with the hopes to reinvigorate our efforts and help this phenomenon to be taken seriously and receive support in the investigation of recent cases like the crash that had happened in the north of Patagonia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. Investigations in Argentina began with Navy projects and then later they went to the National Gendarmerie as well as the Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. Global projects began to gain support in the 1960s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. There was the famous case of Captain Miotti that I was able to investigate research years later in Yacanto, a province of Cordoba.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. There was a sighting of a conical-shaped object on a foggy morning and it was photographed clearly and it was analyzed by the National Aeronautics Service.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. They concluded that there was a dark part on the underside of the object showing absorption of light or radiation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. This was one of the first speculations about the possible energy aspect to UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. I'm not sure if we actually have a copy of this image in my PowerPoint.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. If it is there, we can project it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. If not, we'll continue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. My first contact with classified archives came through my friendship with journalist Eduardo Azcuy, who was one of the first advisers to the Navy on the naval project.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. In the 1960s, the Navy was on alert for the apparition of submerged objects that were not detected by sonar and they moved at high speeds.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. Sometimes they would fly and they were in the form of a cigar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. We called these unidentified submerged objects or USOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. These cases were pursued with the support of American ships and they helped in the research.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. Unfortunately, there are no declassified documents on these cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. The first official group of the Navy was called COPEFO, which was the permanent commission for the study of UFOs and it was led by now late Captain Omar Pagani.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. Years later, in the Argentinian and Chilean bases in Antarctica, there were multiple sightings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. It was a multicolored disk that led to magnetic disturbances in the detector's radar on both bases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. In 1965, personnel from the Deception Island, also in Antarctica, were able to take a single photo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. This was with underwater volcanoes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. In terms of the chronology of acknowledgement of official cases, I made a list of declassified cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. The '70s were a particularly busy time, but this began in the '60s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. In 1962, a fighter plane squadron from the Esporta base, which is inside the Buenos Aires province, detected UFOs on the landing strip and they made an attempt to intercept them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. In 1965, the same thing happened in that same area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. This is an area that is very dry and hot and there was a great concentration of sightings in the '60s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. In 1978, there was a very interesting case in El Dique de la Florida where a UFO landed and there was a humanoid who exited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. There were a number of witnesses to this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. The next year, I met with some of the witnesses and the police of the province provided an official communique where they talked about the prints that were found on the ground from that being.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. That year, the provincial police published a document where they showed a giant UFO that actually had an impact on the train rails.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. In 1982, in Catamarca, which is a province in a town that's curiously called London, and that happens a lot on the Falkland Islands, but the police saw an object that had showed deflagration that produced great destruction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. The chief of police issued an official report and I was the only investigator at that time when I arrived after the event.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. In 1986, in Cordova, in Cerro El Pajarillo, which is one of the communities in Uritorco, Cruz de Eje, there was a print that seemed to be the crash of a UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. The regional authorities accepted this case as one that was strange and one that needed to be investigated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. Between '87 and '89, a commission was created under the armed forces and it was led by a great friend of mine, Julio Goxena-Aguaro, and it was very important in the province of Entre Rios, there was a phenomenon of UFOs that would actually have an impact on the ground and I had the opportunity of taking video and investigate this over several years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. In 2009, Argentinian investigation groups were united under a single association called CEFORA, which is the Commission for the Study of UFO Phenomena in the Argentinian Republic.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. They included scientists, investigators, and members of the military and they sought to access in a methodological and systematic way the secret archives related to UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. One of the first groups that was being pushed by this commission was the support and acceptance by the Argentinian Air Force, which decided to create, three years ago, CEFAE, which is the Commission on Aerospace Phenomena Study.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. This was under the leadership of Captain Mariano Mohabt and a few civilians.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. They have investigation brigades like Carlos Ferguson, Carlos Urchuk, and Andrea Simondini.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. The second phase, which continues today, is under the guise of Commodore Guillermo Aloy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. The first official investigation took place in September of 2011, when a glowing ball fell from the sky and led to a lethal and tremendous explosion in Monte Grande, which is in the province of Buenos Aires.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. This case remains unsolved, it's alleged that it could have been a gas explosion, but the public and civilian investigators continue to rule that possibility out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. There was great destruction and one person was killed in the course of this incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. With respect to UFOs, this Air Force Commission has clarified that its work is not focused on proving the existence of extraterrestrial life, rather it is a scientific study that can lead to the truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. CEFORA has continued to ask for the declassification of documentation on this case and the previous cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. There's a case in Guadalupe, Polanco.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. This was a case of the Argentinian airline where the pilot saw a UFO that attempted to land in the Bariloche airport.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. The object went in front of the plane and took an escape route.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. The crew was very frightened and all radio signals and communication with the airport were cut off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. At the same time, there was a general blackout in the city and a gendarmerie plane saw the danger of the situation at the same time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. So Sephora was able to get transcripts of the communications between the aircraft and the tower.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. However, it has not been able to obtain the documentation prepared by the gendarmerie.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. They have recently begun to declassify cases like the case of Campo de Mayo in the province of Buenos Aires from November 1972.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. At this time, an object in the shape of a half moon, which had a light of a smaller size underneath, began to make emergency maneuvers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. So Sephora is currently in talks with different ministries for UFO declassification.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. One is the Ministry of Defense, under which the Air Force and the Navy fall, and the other is the Ministry of Security, which includes the national gendarmerie and the prefecture.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. Sephora has brought together more than 1,000 citizen signatures for the presentation of a bill before the House of Representatives in the nation and the executive branch and the Ministry of Defense for the declassification of these documents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. Obviously, this is being supported by other civilian groups.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. There are many, many particularly young people who are following these investigations, young people with a lot of energy, and who have united behind the declassification of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. You can see Argentina is part of South America.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. We've had some very interesting cases that have been striking internationally.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. Many investigators, as I noted before, Jaime and some of the other international investigators, we believe that some of these cases, these rich cases that are very strange but there have been reliable sightings, could bring new elements to the fore.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. I remember Dr. Hynek always told me that perhaps we'll never know about this phenomenon fully in our lifetimes, but it's worth the sacrifice and energy we are investing in our investigations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. Our work, our task, is to compile information so that scientists in the future may be able to shed some light on this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. And in conclusion, with regard to official investigations, over the last 40 years, military entities have studied UFOs with scientific care to separate misinterpretations, natural misinterpretations, and the difference between science and nature.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. Things that cannot be explained.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. The position of these agencies has not changed much since the 1960s up till now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. And I am a living witness to this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. I have spent the past 36 years investigating these UFO phenomena, not just in Argentina but in Latin America and the world as a whole.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. But we continue to believe that our elegant universe, it warrants the benefit of the doubt that this phenomenon may or may not be extraterrestrial, but we still need more proof.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. Reading between the lines, we know that many of these official organizations, they don't say it or write it, but they believe that the phenomenon could, in fact, be extraterrestrial.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. The Argentinian Armed Forces and their scientific commissions have never openly declared that the phenomenon might be extraterrestrial, but rather they let people read between the lines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. [ Applause ]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 2

448. Thank you very much, and I want to thank all of you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. We're going to take a short break, and then we will come back and have questions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. So what do you think, 15 minutes? 15 minutes, so if we can be back at a quarter to 11, that would be perfect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. [BLANK_AUDIO]
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
