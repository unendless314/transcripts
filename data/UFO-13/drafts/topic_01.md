43. And I would like to congratulate the representatives of the American Congress for this important conference that will be remembered for the mankind forever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. This is a beginning of a process of disclosure of the most important event for mankind lately.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. We wish for long to have contact with space people, and this fact has been hiding for the government for long.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. Why the government decided to hide it from the people, such an important fact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. Because we have heard here in this conference from the military, retired militaries, that these beings, extraterrestrial beings, have such a capability of interfering in the nuclear weapons systems, even activating and deactivating these weapons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. This explains why governments hide these from the people, because it changed the balance of power in the entire world, and they are doing a campaign to take out the credibility of this phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

49. And those people that are working here for many years, working hard with difficultness, is passing through humiliations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. Is it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. Humiliation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. That's it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. Because they say they do not exist, UFO do not exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. In fact, what we have heard here, they exist, they are here to save us against the insanity of our leaders.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. Because the powerful of these nuclear weapons can destroy the whole planet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. I have heard them yesterday to prepare this speech.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. The power of the last detonation, which was by Russians, it is 3,333 times the power of Hiroshima bomb.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. So do you know the name the Russians put in that artifact?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. Translated to English, it is, "We will show you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. It could be colored, must be colored.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. We hope we never use it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. So just looking at the name of this artifact, like Hiroshima bomb, little boy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. The other one, fat man.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

64. We can see what is the mentality of those people that are behind these weapons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

65. And we declare, by the ufologist community, and also those ones that do not do research, but has in their heart, in their mind, a great wish to establish a friendships relationship with extraterrestrials.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. So what is happening here is really quite important for mankind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. Congratulate for everybody that is organizing, taking part of this conference.
