315. Good morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. A cordial greeting and thanking the Commission and my thanks for inviting me to present this information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. I'm Oscar Santa María Huertas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. I have been a combat pilot of Peru's Air Force, and I would like to present a document to the U.S. Department of Defense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. Please, first image.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. You can see that here, this document was a 1982 document that was produced by the U.S.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. Department of Defense informing in the near of the La Jolla, south of Peru base, there was several opportunities, a UFO reported first in the morning time, the second time in the times of the evening of the next day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. The UFO that appeared in the morning, an airplane, SU-22, tried to intercept it and destroy it without being lucky in the objective.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. It was ineffective to try to destroy this UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. Second page, there's more details about this event given the name of the base and other details pertaining.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. The pilot that was driving, I was the pilot that was piloting this airplane, and I will be very happy to narrate and explain the events that occurred.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. I was the pilot in this airplane trying to intercept the UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. In the area base of La Joya in the Department of Arequipa in the south of Peru, 11 April 1980, in the morning, 1,800 people, civil and military, that they were part of the base could observe at the end of the landing strip an object that looked like an aerostatic globe suspended in the air, about five kilometers of distance and 1,500 of altitude.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. The system of radars did not detect this globe approaching, and this object did not respond to the tower of control messages.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. This was a strange location that was not allowed except for military, so we thought it was a espionage for this military base, and it could be considered a danger for the security of the country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. So the squad was ordered that one of the pilots did have to go up in the air and follow the object and destroy the object.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. The air command gave me the order to take off and to shoot this object before it approaches too fast to the base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. So I first approached this object, and this airplane that I was piloting had military weapons.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. I did an ascent from the right to the 1,500 kilometers of height, and I initiated the attack procedures.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. When I was close to the object, I threw away a charge of missiles, but this globe never got any damages and started ascending and living in a very, very fast pace.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. During the persecution of this globe, I had a 900 kilometers per hour speed, but I couldn't reach him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. When I arrived to 84 kilometers of distance from the base, this globe stopped very quickly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. I had to make a very quick maneuver to avoid confrontation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. When I wasn't getting close to shooting again at the distance, the object did a very fast movement and went underneath my airplane without allowing me to shoot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. Our locations evaded my location and avoided on the last minute all my intent to shoot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. Confronted with this situation, I took the decision to speed on a very high velocity and ascend very high to go ahead and attack in a very vertical manner, but the globe did have a maneuver of lifting very, very quickly, so I wasn't able to focus to shoot.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. The next view, I accelerated my airplane to get to 1.6 mach, approximately 1,850 kilometers per hour, and I began to ascend.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. I surpassed the position of the balloon, and I hoped to be able to be high enough to get into my attack maneuver, but I was surprised when the balloon, again, quickly ascended and was able to get alongside my plane, and therefore I was unable to attack it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. With the UFO parallel to my plane, I kept going up, hoping to be able to surpass it to be able to get into attack position, but I was unable to do so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. So we got up to 19,200 meters, about 63,000 feet, as you can see here, where the balloon stopped its ascent, and I tried to, again, get it in my sights to be able to fire, but it was impossible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. At that point, my low-fuel light came on, saying that I had just enough fuel to get back to land.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. Since I could no longer continue my attack, I approached it, got to a distance of about 100 meters, and I was able to see that this balloon was not a balloon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. It was about 10 meters in diameter, and on the top it had an enamelled, a non-metallic cream-colored enamelled dome, and that in its base it had a wide, silver, circular metallic surface.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. It did not have any wings, jet propulsion, windows, antenna, anything like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. These are obviously surfaces that aircraft usually have; pulling myself together, I went back to the air base, and I reported to the control tower what I had seen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. In total, there were 22 minutes of maneuvers that are clearly etched in my brain, and I am convinced that there is extraterrestrial technology and life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. I will never forget what I saw that day, and this is a sketch of what I saw.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. If you could go on to the next slide.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. It more or less looked like this, and the two next slides we can see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. This is a photo of me with my plane.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. This is from 1980.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. Next slide, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. This is a Sukhoi Su-22.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. That is the end of my remarks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. That must have been some ride.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
