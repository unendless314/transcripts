142. Chile has a rich history of UFO cases, some of them highly strange, like an incident involving a group of seven soldiers in a corporal near Putre in Chile's northern Atacama region near the border with Peru in 1977, the so-called time warp case of Corporal Valdez, which became the subject of my very first UFO article back in 1977.

→ {"text": "事實上，我給了這位將軍一份勞倫斯·洛克菲勒資助的不明飛行物簡報文件，這是我共同撰寫的，這份文件或許在為 1997 年 CEFA-A 的成立整理證據方面發揮了小小的作用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. During its first months, however, CEFA-A seemed rudderless until Air Force General retired Ricardo Bermudez, who was named director.

190. Another key component is to establish official cooperation among different countries, since UFOs don't seem to care about national boundaries and are reported widely all over the world.
→ {"text": "另一個關鍵要素是在不同國家之間建立官方合作，因為不明飛行物似乎不在乎國界，而且在世界各地都有廣泛的報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

194. Other countries are moving ahead with an open and transparent investigation of this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "其他國家正在以公開透明的方式推進對這個現象的調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

195. The unknown nature of the phenomenon itself and the likelihood that it originates not on this earth requires a change of attitude and a level of openness that seems to be amiss in this country.
→ {"text": "這個現象本身的未知性質，以及它可能起源於地球之外的可能性，需要改變態度，需要一種開放程度，而這種開放程度在這個國家似乎有所欠缺。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "讓我以我對 Bermudez 將軍訪談中的一段話作為結束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
