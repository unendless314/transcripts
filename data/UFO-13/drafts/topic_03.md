## Speaker Group 1

126. I think we're going to just go down the line, have everyone testify, and then come back for questions, if that's all right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. Welcome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. And I'm probably going to butcher your last name, but Antonio Huneeus.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. Welcome to the committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. Good morning, distinguished members of the panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. I already introduced myself on Monday, brought a little bit of my biography, so this time I will keep it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. I will skip that part.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. I'm representing Chile, even though I'm not officially part of, member of that committee, but I know, as you know, I'm a Chilean-American, and I know the history of the Chilean official agency very well, so I will read now from my prepared statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. In recent years, Chile has become one of the world's leading nations in the official study and recognition of the UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. UFO agencies or departments have been traditionally been under the Air Force in most countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. In France, as we shall see in the next session, the effort is under the space agency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. But Chile has taken a novel approach which makes logical sense.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. Its committee, known as CEFA, which is a translation for committee for the study of anomalous aerial phenomena, is under the Civil Aviation Agency, DGAC.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. In other words, it's like if the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration, had a UFO department.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. Chile's aviation agents, civil aviation agencies all over the world that deal with aircraft safety and navigation, and UFOs, though not regulated by human governmental agencies, are primarily flying in the air and could pose a threat to aviation safety.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. Chile has a rich history of UFO cases, some of them highly strange, like an incident involving a group of seven soldiers in a corporal near Putre in Chile's northern Atacama region near the border with Peru in 1977, the so-called time warp case of Corporal Valdez, which became the subject of my very first UFO article back in 1977.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. In the 1980s, Gustavo Rodriguez, an air traffic controller, began to collect cases involving pilots who would call the control tower asking if there was any traffic that could explain lights or objects they were seeing during the course of their flights.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. There were also incidents involving the scramble of military jets, a situation common to many countries of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. In the mid-90s, Rodriguez received the support of General Ramon Vega, a former commander in chief of the Chilean Air Force and later a senator.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. I had the opportunity of meeting both Gustavo Rodriguez and General Vega during several trips to Santiago in the 1990s.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. I gave the general, in fact, a copy of the Lawrence Rockefeller-sponsored UFO briefing document which I had co-authored and which perhaps played a small role in marshaling the evidence for the creation of CEFA-A in 1997.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. During its first months, however, CEFA-A seemed rudderless until Air Force General retired Ricardo Bermudez, who was named director.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. General Bermudez was the director of the Technical School of Aeronautics, which trains air traffic controllers, and it was at this school, which I visited many times, where the commission was housed for a number of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. CEFA-A's mission is to "record and analyze all relevant reports concerning UAP, unidentified aerial phenomena, occurring within the national territory on the basis of a serious objective and scientific analysis with the purpose of determining any possible risk to air operations."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. In 2002, CEFA-A became essentially inactive for a number of years, but in December of 2009, the DGAC, the Civil Aviation Agency, announced that CEFA-A was being reactivated and once again General Bermudez was brought back to direct it and Gustavo Rodriguez to serve as secretary.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. The committee's headquarters was moved to a new location at the National Aeronautics and Space Museum near the old airport of Los Cerrillos in Santiago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. One of the first things they did was to launch an official website, and I have the URL address here, which is by far the best of all the South American official agencies, the website I mean.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. It contains several UFO aircraft incidents with audio recordings of pilot controlled tower communications, videos, documents, articles, and other data.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. CEFA-A has an external committee of advisors, which includes eight top scientists from the Chilean Commission of Nuclear Energy, Aerospace Medicine at Santiago University, astronomers from the Metropolitan and Catholic Universities, a plasma physicist from Santiago University, a geographer and expert on satellite imagery from Chile State University, and two psychologists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

156. There is also a CEFA-A internal committee, which includes experts on operation safety, air control center, meteorology, air accidents investigations, aerospace engineering, and audiovisual.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. They also have representatives from each branch of the armed forces and the police.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. On August 11, 2008, the Chilean government passed law 20285, known as transparency law.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. In some respects, it works similarly to our Freedom of Information Act.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. Government agencies have 20 days to respond to queries from the public regarding public records.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. But in some respects, it goes beyond the FOIA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. With exception of matters dealing with national security and foreign relations, the transparency law was designed so government agencies can act in an open and transparent manner, even in cases where they receive no queries from the public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. CEFA-A has fully complied with the requirements of the transparency law, and as explained by General Bermudez, "This is the way we deal with the phenomena, openly and freely."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. CEFA-A has documented many UFO cases involving commercial and military pilots.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. One of the more interesting ones, known as the Pelican case, occurred on June 24, 2010, and it involved three different aircraft, two airliners and a Navy plane called Pelican.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. As put by General Bermudez at a lecture he gave at the International UFO Congress in Fountain Hills, Arizona in 2012, "Three airplanes witnessed the same phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. Two commercial planes are approaching Santiago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. The military plane is coming 300 miles from the north, and an object is cruising his airway.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. The pilot reports something he sees camouflaged in erratic motion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. In the audio communication, one can hear the pilot saying, 'Roger, at this moment, I can't see it anymore.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. I could see a traffic loud and clear.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. It looked like a cloud, camouflaged as a cloud, but with erratic motion.'"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. This case, as well as another one in Punta Arenas, detected by primary radar in 2011, is important because you have different professional pilots reporting the same object.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. As explained by General Bermudez, quote, "Think for a moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. If one experienced commercial pilot reports to me that something flew across in front of his airplane, I pay careful attention.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. But now, if a second commercial pilot reports the same a few seconds later, I become interested.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. But if a third pilot, a military one, confirms the same fact, I tend to believe it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. In this case, do we have one UFO close to the airplanes, or do we have two UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. If we have one, its incredible speed doesn't correspond to anything we have now, 300 miles, you know, like in a couple of minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. During the same lecture at the International UFO Congress, General Bermudez released a multiple video case taken at the El Bosque base in Santiago, where the Air Force Academy is located, which made world headlines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. This was because several videos were taken during an important ceremony for the change of the commander of the Chilean Air Force on November 4, 2010, attended by the president, all the commanders of the armed forces and top brass, the minister of defense, and other cabinet members, the diplomatic corps, and many other important officials, including General Bermudez himself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. The ceremony is popular with the public and widely photographed and filmed because it includes the air parade by all the different squadrons of the Chilean Air Force.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. It must be clarified, however, that none of the dignitaries or public saw the UFOs at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. These were discovered later as people began to review the footage they had taken.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. I'm enclosing an interview I did with General Bermudez, published in Open Minds Magazine issue 16, October, November 2012, where he explains the methodology of CFA, as well as many of their best UFO cases, including the multiple footage case of El Bosque.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. CFA has shown that a serious and open official investigation of UFOs can be conducted in a serious and scientific manner.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. Some of the ingredients include cooperation among different government agencies, scientific and academic institutions, and even the civilian UFO community.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. Official and private investigators can and should cooperate instead of fighting with each other.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. The same model has taken place in other South American countries, like Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and Ecuador.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. Another key component is to establish official cooperation among different countries, since UFOs don't seem to care about national boundaries and are reported widely all over the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. For this reason, CEFAA and CRIDOVNI, the official UFO agency run by the Uruguayan Air Force since 1978, signed an official agreement of cooperation and exchange of data in 2012.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. And we have here with us Colonel Sanchez, who was in fact the person that signed that agreement with General Bermudez.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. The United States likes to think that it's always ahead in all areas of society, but I'm afraid that this is not the case in the field of ufology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. Other countries are moving ahead with an open and transparent investigation of this phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. The unknown nature of the phenomenon itself and the likelihood that it originates not on this earth requires a change of attitude and a level of openness that seems to be amiss in this country.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. Let me finish with a quote from my interview with General Bermudez.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. Now I'm quoting him, "The official conclusion is that the anomalous aerial phenomenon known as unidentified flying objects is real and is present within the controlled airspace and outside the controlled airspace.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. It is also present in the sea.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. We have some reports from our Navy in that respect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. It is present everywhere and therefore it is necessary to share the information in order to have more background and be able to study it more scientifically so that we can give real information to the people and not rely on what is shown in TV and in the sensationalist media."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
