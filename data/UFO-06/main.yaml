  source_text: Thank you very much, sir. I think in our first session we did a pretty
    good job in terms of what's happened to you guys, and you can always, you military
    servants, you can hear by our questioning that we're very concerned, and I'm sure
    the entire Congress would be.

    text: 非常感謝您，先生。我認為在第一場會議中，我們針對各位的遭遇已經做了相當深入的討論，身為軍人的各位，從我們的提問中應該能感受到我們非常關切此事，我相信整個國會也會有同樣的關注。

  source_text: Thank you, Madam Chair. We have, I guess, a significant problem in
    terms of the evidence record that despite the fact that the Ministry of Defence
    case file has now been declassified and released, and you'll have some of the
    papers, the document that I referred to dated February the 16th, in the final
    paragraph where it mentions that General Gabriel visited the base, papers relating
    to that visit have not yet been located, and it's my hope that this would be perhaps
    the key in unlocking not just John and Jim's quest for their medical records,
    but perhaps a wider revelation of what it is that we're dealing with, because
    clearly if the Commander-in-Chief, United States Air Force, visited, and we know
    exactly because of that document, the time scale, it must be between the date
    of the incident itself and 16th of February, people, whether they be journalists
    or attorneys or whoever,
  translation:
    text: 謝謝您，主席女士。我認為在證據記錄方面存在一個重大問題：儘管國防部的案件檔案現已解密並公開，各位手上也有一些文件，包括我提到的那份日期為 2 月
      16 日的文件，在最後一段提及 Gabriel 將軍曾訪問該基地，但與該次訪問相關的文件至今尚未找到。我希望這些文件或許能成為解開謎團的關鍵，不僅是 John
      和 Jim 尋求醫療紀錄的關鍵，也可能揭示我們正在處理的更廣泛真相。因為顯然，如果美國駐歐空軍總司令親自訪問基地，而根據該文件我們能確切得知時間範圍——必定是在事件發生日期與
      2 月 16 日之間——無論是記者、律師或任何人，

    must exist, clearly must exist, showing why such a senior United States Air Force
    officer visited those bases, and it seems to me that there must be questions that
    could be asked along the lines of, "May we have the paperwork relating to the
    General's visit, to the items of evidence which were removed, presumably back
    to his headquarters at Ramstein, to any investigation that was done either at
    Ramstein or by headquarters, USAAF or DOD, or indeed by any other agency."

    text: 都有一個非常狹窄的時間窗口可以追查必然存在的文件軌跡，顯示為何如此高階的美國空軍軍官會訪問這些基地。我認為可以提出以下問題：『我們能否取得與將軍訪問相關的文件、與被移除的證據物品相關的文件（推測應被送回其位於拉姆施泰因空軍基地的總部）、以及任何在拉姆施泰因或美國陸軍航空軍總部、國防部，甚至任何其他機構所進行的調查記錄？』

    with a top secret facility which I later wrote security plans for and stuff at
    that base which was Marlesham Heath, it was a C3 facility, communications, and
    it had a building there that at the time had a retinal eye scanner, in 1980 that's
    like high tech stuff and you don't really waste your money, the government's money
    on those kind of things over there like that but that was the unusual part of
    it so there was operations within there and they were civilian by the way, none
    of those people were wearing uniforms and then just down the street from that
    another mile and a half or two was MI6, British intelligence that operated out
    of there and then of course

      Heath），它是一個 C3 設施，指揮、控制與通訊設施，那裡有一棟建築物在當時配備了視網膜掃描器，在 1980 年那可是高科技設備，政府不會在那種地方浪費錢在這類東西上，但那正是不尋常之處，所以那裡有一些行動在進行，而且順帶一提，他們都是平民，那些人都沒穿制服，然後就在那條街下去大約一英里半到兩英里的地方是軍情六處（MI6），英國情報機構在那裡運作，然後當然
