  source_text: Thank you very much, sir. I think in our first session we did a pretty good job in terms of what's happened
    to you guys, and you can always, you military servants, you can hear by our questioning that we're very concerned, and
    I'm sure the entire Congress would be.

    if you took any notes, and anything else you might help to educate us in terms of what we're looking at in line with what
    this hearing is about.

  source_text: Thank you, Madam Chair. We have, I guess, a significant problem in terms of the evidence record that despite
    the fact that the Ministry of Defence case file has now been declassified and released, and you'll have some of the papers,
    the document that I referred to dated February the 16th, in the final paragraph where it mentions that General Gabriel
    visited the base, papers relating to that visit have not yet been located, and it's my hope that this would be perhaps
    the key in unlocking not just John and Jim's quest for their medical records, but perhaps a wider revelation of what it
    is that we're dealing with, because clearly if the Commander-in-Chief, United States Air Force, visited, and we know exactly
    because of that document, the time scale, it must be between the date of the incident itself and 16th of February, people,
    whether they be journalists or attorneys or whoever,

  source_text: have a very narrow window of time to go after the paper trail that must exist, clearly must exist, showing
    why such a senior United States Air Force officer visited those bases, and it seems to me that there must be questions
    that could be asked along the lines of, "May we have the paperwork relating to the General's visit, to the items of evidence
    which were removed, presumably back to his headquarters at Ramstein, to any investigation that was done either at Ramstein
    or by headquarters, USAAF or DOD, or indeed by any other agency."

    and Jim can, when you question him, doubtless elaborate on this, I believe came from Jim Peniston's police notebook, his
    Air Force police notebook.

    shaking.

    were drawn into the area, this object was drawn there because there was interest in the area and the interest has to do
    with a top secret facility which I later wrote security plans for and stuff at that base which was Marlesham Heath, it
    was a C3 facility, communications, and it had a building there that at the time had a retinal eye scanner, in 1980 that's
    like high tech stuff and you don't really waste your money, the government's money on those kind of things over there
    like that but that was the unusual part of it so there was operations within there and they were civilian by the way,
    none of those people were wearing uniforms and then just down the street from that another mile and a half or two was
    MI6, British intelligence that operated out of there and then of course

    that may not sound very dramatic to anybody, and that's Sergeant Burroughs and Sergeant Penniston's medical records, because
    I submit, if we see in those white gums, if we see in those heart problems at a young age of a recent Air Force person
    that served in England, if we find some of the other, and I can't remember, I wrote them all down, and I may have to talk
    to you again to get this letter, but I submit that if we find those kinds of evidences, and what there's no legal reason,
    I've even chatted with an attorney during the break to withhold a medical record, and I'm sure your attorneys probably
    would confirm what my attorney just told me.
