## Speaker Group 1

1. Thank you very much, sir. I think in our first session we did a pretty good job in terms of what's happened to you guys, and you can always, you military servants, you can hear by our questioning that we're very concerned, and I'm sure the entire Congress would be.

2. I'd like to use this time to talk more about the incident, what actually happened, if it was any recordings, if you took any notes, and anything else you might help to educate us in terms of what we're looking at in line with what this hearing is about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

3. And I think I'll just go down the line here. I think I'd like to do Mr. Pope first. Frascona, second, and then we'll have the two servicemen. Mr. Pope.

4. Thank you, Madam Chair. We have, I guess, a significant problem in terms of the evidence record that despite the fact that the Ministry of Defence case file has now been declassified and released, and you'll have some of the papers, the document that I referred to dated February the 16th, in the final paragraph where it mentions that General Gabriel visited the base, papers relating to that visit have not yet been located, and it's my hope that this would be perhaps the key in unlocking not just John and Jim's quest for their medical records, but perhaps a wider revelation of what it is that we're dealing with, because clearly if the Commander-in-Chief, United States Air Force, visited, and we know exactly because of that document, the time scale, it must be between the date of the incident itself and 16th of February, people, whether they be journalists or attorneys or whoever,
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

5. have a very narrow window of time to go after the paper trail that must exist, clearly must exist, showing why such a senior United States Air Force officer visited those bases, and it seems to me that there must be questions that could be asked along the lines of, "May we have the paperwork relating to the General's visit, to the items of evidence which were removed, presumably back to his headquarters at Ramstein, to any investigation that was done either at Ramstein or by headquarters, USAAF or DOD, or indeed by any other agency."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

6. So I think there is this possibility that armed with the declassified Ministry of Defense document, we now know what we want.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

7. That's a good point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

8. That's a good point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

9. Can you speak a bit about the aircraft itself, the aircraft itself, and if there were any presence of any life, any different things in your investigations?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

10. Can you share with the committee anything along those lines?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

11. Well, I think what I would say is that the sketch of the craft and the sketch of the symbols that you have, and Jim can, when you question him, doubtless elaborate on this, I believe came from Jim Peniston's police notebook, his Air Force police notebook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

12. And again, he'll correct me if I'm wrong on this, but he did as well as the photographs that he took, did some sketches, and then did a slightly more sanitized version, which you have in front of him, in front of you, when he'd stopped shaking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

13. Does that exist now, Mr. Penniston?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

14. Is there a notebook and pictures and all that, or does the military have that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

15. I do have my own notebook, and it's in my possession.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

16. The chances of that notebook surviving are probably one in a thousand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

17. Surviving what?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

18. About not being thrown away or -- By you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

19. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

20. You're going to throw it away?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

21. Well, at the time, it was like I wanted the whole situation to go away, so -- Well, but it's here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

22. The only thing that's gone is your medical records at this point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

23. Yeah, I know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

24. I know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

25. I mean, I think -- please don't throw it away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

26. No, at the time, that's what I was -- I threw it in a drawer, and I didn't exercise proper care with it, and I found it four years later, it tells you I'm a pack rat.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

27. Four years later, after we PCS'd, came back to the States, and then I said, "Well, I better keep that."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

28. I think you better hold onto that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

29. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

30. It's just for prosperity as well as it's part of your life and a lot of history that's unfolding, so it would be -- it would behoove you to hold onto a pod we put in a safety deposit box and that kind of holding on, I don't mean just in a dresser drawer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

31. I'm serious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

32. No, it's no longer a dresser drawer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

33. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

34. No, I think you preserve it because it's historical, and you may be rewarded more than you think with it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

35. You know, testing done and all that stuff for the -- people want it dated, I guess.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

36. But those -- everybody carried notebooks back then at the -- Everybody didn't have your experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

37. Well, we were -- what we did it for is to record for reports.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

38. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

39. You know, I'm trying to keep everything rational and procedural like I was used to, so how am I going to explain all this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

40. I'm writing this down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

41. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

42. And that's required, actually, as you were in charge that night, that you would take as much documentation as you could so that you could prepare an adequate report.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

43. That's how that works, I'm sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

44. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

45. Mr. Pope, are you done?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

46. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

47. Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

48. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
