## Speaker Group 1

1. Thank you very much, sir. I think in our first session we did a pretty good job in terms of what's happened to you guys, and you can always, you military servants, you can hear by our questioning that we're very concerned, and I'm sure the entire Congress would be.
→ {"text": "非常感謝您，先生。我認為在第一場會議中，我們針對各位的遭遇已經做了相當深入的討論，身為軍人的各位，從我們的提問中應該能感受到我們非常關切此事，我相信整個國會也會有同樣的關注。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

2. I'd like to use this time to talk more about the incident, what actually happened, if it was any recordings, if you took any notes, and anything else you might help to educate us in terms of what we're looking at in line with what this hearing is about.
→ {"text": "我希望利用這段時間更深入討論事件本身，實際發生了什麼事、是否有任何錄音記錄、你們是否做了筆記，以及任何其他能幫助我們理解此次聽證會主題的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

3. And I think I'll just go down the line here. I think I'd like to do Mr. Pope first. Frascona, second, and then we'll have the two servicemen. Mr. Pope.
→ {"text": "我想我們就按順序進行。首先請 Pope 先生發言，接著是 Frascogna，然後是兩位軍人。Pope 先生，請。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Frascona應為Frascogna（律師姓名），但原文如此，保留原樣"}

4. Thank you, Madam Chair. We have, I guess, a significant problem in terms of the evidence record that despite the fact that the Ministry of Defence case file has now been declassified and released, and you'll have some of the papers, the document that I referred to dated February the 16th, in the final paragraph where it mentions that General Gabriel visited the base, papers relating to that visit have not yet been located, and it's my hope that this would be perhaps the key in unlocking not just John and Jim's quest for their medical records, but perhaps a wider revelation of what it is that we're dealing with, because clearly if the Commander-in-Chief, United States Air Force, visited, and we know exactly because of that document, the time scale, it must be between the date of the incident itself and 16th of February, people, whether they be journalists or attorneys or whoever,
→ {"text": "謝謝您，主席女士。我認為在證據記錄方面存在一個重大問題：儘管國防部的案件檔案現已解密並公開，各位手上也有一些文件，包括我提到的那份日期為 2 月 16 日的文件，在最後一段提及 Gabriel 將軍曾訪問該基地，但與該次訪問相關的文件至今尚未找到。我希望這些文件或許能成為解開謎團的關鍵，不僅是 John 和 Jim 尋求醫療紀錄的關鍵，也可能揭示我們正在處理的更廣泛真相。因為顯然，如果美國駐歐空軍總司令親自訪問基地，而根據該文件我們能確切得知時間範圍——必定是在事件發生日期與 2 月 16 日之間——無論是記者、律師或任何人，", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Commander-in-Chief, United States Air Force 指 Gabriel 將軍的職稱，根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「美國駐歐空軍總司令」"}

5. have a very narrow window of time to go after the paper trail that must exist, clearly must exist, showing why such a senior United States Air Force officer visited those bases, and it seems to me that there must be questions that could be asked along the lines of, "May we have the paperwork relating to the General's visit, to the items of evidence which were removed, presumably back to his headquarters at Ramstein, to any investigation that was done either at Ramstein or by headquarters, USAAF or DOD, or indeed by any other agency."
→ {"text": "都有一個非常狹窄的時間窗口可以追查必然存在的文件軌跡，顯示為何如此高階的美國空軍軍官會訪問這些基地。我認為可以提出以下問題：『我們能否取得與將軍訪問相關的文件、與被移除的證據物品相關的文件（推測應被送回其位於拉姆施泰因空軍基地的總部）、以及任何在拉姆施泰因或美國陸軍航空軍總部、國防部，甚至任何其他機構所進行的調查記錄？』", "confidence": "high", "notes": "USAAF 根據 terminology.yaml 為 United States Army Air Forces（美國陸軍航空軍），DOD 為 Department of Defense（國防部），Ramstein 為拉姆施泰因空軍基地"}

6. So I think there is this possibility that armed with the declassified Ministry of Defense document, we now know what we want.
→ {"text": "因此我認為，有了這份已解密的國防部文件，我們現在清楚知道我們要尋找什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

7. That's a good point.
→ {"text": "這是個好論點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

8. That's a good point.
→ {"text": "這是個好論點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

9. Can you speak a bit about the aircraft itself, the aircraft itself, and if there were any presence of any life, any different things in your investigations?
→ {"text": "您能否談談飛行器本身，以及在你們的調查中是否發現任何生命跡象或其他不尋常的事物？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

10. Can you share with the committee anything along those lines?
→ {"text": "您能否與委員會分享這方面的任何資訊？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

11. Well, I think what I would say is that the sketch of the craft and the sketch of the symbols that you have, and Jim can, when you question him, doubtless elaborate on this, I believe came from Jim Peniston's police notebook, his Air Force police notebook.
→ {"text": "我想說的是，各位手上的飛行器草圖和符號草圖——Jim 在接受提問時無疑會詳細說明——我相信都來自 Jim Penniston 的警察筆記本，他的空軍警察筆記本。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Peniston原文拼寫為Penniston，此處保留原文拼寫錯誤"}

12. And again, he'll correct me if I'm wrong on this, but he did as well as the photographs that he took, did some sketches, and then did a slightly more sanitized version, which you have in front of him, in front of you, when he'd stopped shaking.
→ {"text": "如果我說錯了他會糾正我，但據我所知，他除了拍攝照片之外，還做了一些草圖，然後在他停止顫抖之後，製作了一個稍微刪減的版本，也就是各位手上的這份。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "sanitized 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「刪減的」"}

13. Does that exist now, Mr. Penniston?
→ {"text": "那份筆記本現在還存在嗎，Penniston 先生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

14. Is there a notebook and pictures and all that, or does the military have that?
→ {"text": "筆記本和照片等等都還在嗎，還是軍方拿走了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

15. I do have my own notebook, and it's in my possession.
→ {"text": "我確實有自己的筆記本，它在我手上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

16. The chances of that notebook surviving are probably one in a thousand.
→ {"text": "那本筆記本能保存下來的機率大概只有千分之一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

17. Surviving what?
→ {"text": "保存下來是指？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

18. About not being thrown away or -- By you?
→ {"text": "是指沒被丟掉還是——是你自己丟掉嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

19. Sure.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

20. You're going to throw it away?
→ {"text": "你要丟掉它嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

21. Well, at the time, it was like I wanted the whole situation to go away, so -- Well, but it's here.
→ {"text": "嗯，當時我希望整個事情就此消失，所以——但它還在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

22. The only thing that's gone is your medical records at this point.
→ {"text": "目前唯一消失的只有你的醫療紀錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

23. Yeah, I know.
→ {"text": "是的，我知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

24. I know.
→ {"text": "我知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

25. I mean, I think -- please don't throw it away.
→ {"text": "我的意思是——請不要丟掉它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

26. No, at the time, that's what I was -- I threw it in a drawer, and I didn't exercise proper care with it, and I found it four years later, it tells you I'm a pack rat.
→ {"text": "不會，當時我只是把它丟進抽屜裡，沒有妥善保管，四年後才找到它，這說明我是個囤積狂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

27. Four years later, after we PCS'd, came back to the States, and then I said, "Well, I better keep that."
→ {"text": "四年後，在我們調動回美國之後，我才說：『好吧，我最好保留這個。』", "confidence": "high", "notes": "PCS = Permanent Change of Station（永久調動），軍事術語"}

28. I think you better hold onto that.
→ {"text": "我認為你最好好好保管它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

29. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

30. It's just for prosperity as well as it's part of your life and a lot of history that's unfolding, so it would be -- it would behoove you to hold onto a pod we put in a safety deposit box and that kind of holding on, I don't mean just in a dresser drawer.
→ {"text": "這不僅是為了後世，也因為它是你生命的一部分，也是正在展開的重要歷史，所以你應該好好保管它，比如放進銀行保險箱那種保管方式，我不是說只放在衣櫃抽屜裡。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文 'a pod we put in' 語意不太清晰，可能是口語表達或轉錄錯誤，按整體語境翻譯"}

31. I'm serious.
→ {"text": "我是認真的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

32. No, it's no longer a dresser drawer.
→ {"text": "不，它已經不在衣櫃抽屜裡了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

33. Yeah.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

34. No, I think you preserve it because it's historical, and you may be rewarded more than you think with it.
→ {"text": "我認為你應該保存它，因為它具有歷史價值，它帶給你的回報可能會超乎你的想像。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

35. You know, testing done and all that stuff for the -- people want it dated, I guess.
→ {"text": "你知道的，進行檢測之類的——我想人們會想要知道它的年代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

36. But those -- everybody carried notebooks back then at the -- Everybody didn't have your experience.
→ {"text": "但那些——當時每個人都帶著筆記本——但不是每個人都有你的經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

37. Well, we were -- what we did it for is to record for reports.
→ {"text": "嗯，我們做筆記是為了撰寫報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

38. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

39. You know, I'm trying to keep everything rational and procedural like I was used to, so how am I going to explain all this?
→ {"text": "你知道，我試圖保持一切理性和按程序進行，就像我習慣的那樣，所以我該如何解釋這一切？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

40. I'm writing this down.
→ {"text": "我正在把這些記下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

41. Exactly.
→ {"text": "正是如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

42. And that's required, actually, as you were in charge that night, that you would take as much documentation as you could so that you could prepare an adequate report.
→ {"text": "而且這實際上是必須的，因為那晚你是負責人，你需要盡可能詳細記錄，以便準備充分的報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

43. That's how that works, I'm sure.
→ {"text": "我相信就是這樣運作的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

44. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

45. Mr. Pope, are you done?
→ {"text": "Pope 先生，您說完了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

46. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

47. Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "是的，謝謝您，主席女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

48. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
