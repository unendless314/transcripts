## Speaker Group 34

889. I believe the year was 1957.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

890. I was at an American Physiological Society meeting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

891. I had just come off of four years of teaching medical school.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

892. I was now a very young Ph.D. and a very serious basic researcher working at the National Institutes of Health.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

893. I was going to deliver a paper -- I did deliver the paper -- on physiological effects of coitus in humans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

894. This was just after Alfred Kinsey had published his first book, so you can get some idea of the environment at that time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

895. There was some serious concern that I would be punished for this by NIH, that there would be repercussions for giving this paper.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

896. This was not the kind of thing you did at that time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

897. I thought that medically it would be nice to know whether medical activity would be hazardous to your health or not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

898. So we published that paper.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

899. One of the members of the press came up to me and said, "You don't need to worry about repercussions from this because there would be all hell to pay in the press if in fact there were repercussions because you are giving this paper today."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

900. Relative to the question that Senator Gravel asked you, it really disturbs me that there would be a suggestion -- by the way, I think that it is inconceivable that the whole truth -- and you swore an oath that you were going to tell us the truth and the whole truth -- it's inconceivable to me that the whole truth could have any impact on our national security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

901. I have some real concerns about our civil liberties and the future is why I carry a copy of the Constitution.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

902. I have no idea if there is anything in your breast that you need to clear, but if there is, I just think that there are enough people watching this, there is enough press out there with all of their liabilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

903. I think that the press will not stand by if there are any repercussions from this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

904. I just wanted to get this -- I have a huge concern about our civil liberties and our security for the future and I just don't want to be a part of any effort to restrain your freedom to tell us anything and everything that you think might be important here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

905. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

906. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

907. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

908. Councilwoman Wolsey?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

909. Well, I just have a very quick question and to each of you up there, what is -- and this is opinion I'm asking -- what is your opinion on the containment or the cover-up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

910. Is it because of the nuclear issue or connection between the base and nuclear?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

911. Or is it because of UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

912. Or do you just -- you don't have to answer, but I'd like your opinion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

913. You're in it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

914. I'd like to go first.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

915. As I said earlier, we're doing an ongoing investigation and what's become apparent to us is that whatever we're dealing with -- and it's been labeled UFO, ET, alien -- one of the first things you'll see in an incident, including where I lived in Arizona, the Phoenix Light, is they bring up the alien stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

916. And that automatically almost immediately makes a lot of people shy away from it based on the cover-up that I believe started with the War of the Worlds when they started conditioning people that aliens and stuff are not a smart thing to talk about or be involved with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

917. But I believe honestly -- and I believe eventually we're going to be able to show this -- that why our government is holding what they are and other governments are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

918. It's got nothing to do with secrecy from the American public or the other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

919. It's about power.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

920. If you look at what the capabilities that we saw out there that night are, would you not believe that there would be a race by every government of the world to try to take that technology and use it for one thing, which we're all good at in this world, is war-making capabilities and to control people and countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

921. And I believe in my heart that it will be eventually exposed that it is somewhat of national defense, but ultimately as a society and a world, we need to get away from that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

922. But that's what's going on with this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

923. It's being covered up because everybody is in a race to try to take this technology and use it against each other.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

924. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

925. (Applause.)
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

926. Okay, the committee will stand adjourned until after lunch at 1.45.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

927. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

928. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
