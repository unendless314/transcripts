900. Relative to the question that Senator Gravel asked you, it really disturbs me that there would be a suggestion -- by the way, I think that it is inconceivable that the whole truth -- and you swore an oath that you were going to tell us the truth and the whole truth -- it's inconceivable to me that the whole truth could have any impact on our national security.
→ {"text": "關於格拉維爾參議員（Senator Gravel）問你們的問題，我真的很困擾會有這樣的暗示——順便說一句，我認為這是不可想像的，完整的真相——而你們宣誓要告訴我們真相和完整的真相——對我來說，完整的真相會對我們的國家安全產生任何影響是不可想像的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Senator Gravel 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「格拉維爾參議員」；national security 翻譯為「國家安全」"}

914. I'd like to go first.
→ {"text": "我想先回答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

915. As I said earlier, we're doing an ongoing investigation and what's become apparent to us is that whatever we're dealing with -- and it's been labeled UFO, ET, alien -- one of the first things you'll see in an incident, including where I lived in Arizona, the Phoenix Light, is they bring up the alien stuff.
→ {"text": "如我之前所說，我們正在進行持續調查，而我們發現的是，無論我們面對的是什麼——而且它被貼上了不明飛行物（UFO）、外星人（ET）、異形（alien）的標籤——在一個事件中，包括我在亞利桑那州居住時發生的鳳凰城光點事件（Phoenix Light），你會看到的第一件事就是他們提出外星人的說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Phoenix Light 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「鳳凰城光點事件」（單數形式）"}

916. And that automatically almost immediately makes a lot of people shy away from it based on the cover-up that I believe started with the War of the Worlds when they started conditioning people that aliens and stuff are not a smart thing to talk about or be involved with.
→ {"text": "而這幾乎立即自動地讓很多人對此退避三舍，這是基於我認為從《世界大戰》（War of the Worlds）廣播劇開始的真相掩蓋，當時他們開始制約人們，讓人們認為談論或涉及外星人之類的事情不是明智之舉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "War of the Worlds 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「《世界大戰》」（1938年 Orson Welles 的廣播劇）；cover-up 翻譯為「真相掩蓋」"}

917. But I believe honestly -- and I believe eventually we're going to be able to show this -- that why our government is holding what they are and other governments are.
→ {"text": "但我誠實地相信——而且我相信最終我們將能夠證明這一點——為什麼我們的政府和其他政府都在隱瞞他們所掌握的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

918. It's got nothing to do with secrecy from the American public or the other countries.
→ {"text": "這與對美國公眾或其他國家保密無關。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

919. It's about power.
→ {"text": "這關乎權力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "核心論點：真相掩蓋的終極原因是權力競逐"}

920. If you look at what the capabilities that we saw out there that night are, would you not believe that there would be a race by every government of the world to try to take that technology and use it for one thing, which we're all good at in this world, is war-making capabilities and to control people and countries.
→ {"text": "如果你看看我們那晚在外面看到的那些能力，你難道不相信世界上每個政府都會競相試圖獲取那項技術，並將其用於一件事，也就是我們在這個世界上都很擅長的事情，那就是製造戰爭的能力以及控制人民和國家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

921. And I believe in my heart that it will be eventually exposed that it is somewhat of national defense, but ultimately as a society and a world, we need to get away from that.
→ {"text": "而我從心底相信，最終會揭露出這在某種程度上確實關乎國防，但最終作為一個社會和世界，我們需要擺脫這種思維。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

922. But that's what's going on with this.
→ {"text": "但這就是這件事的本質。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

923. It's being covered up because everybody is in a race to try to take this technology and use it against each other.
→ {"text": "之所以被掩蓋，是因為每個人都在競相試圖獲取這項技術並用它來對付彼此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "總結：技術競賽是真相掩蓋的根本原因"}
