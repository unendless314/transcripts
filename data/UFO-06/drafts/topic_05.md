## Speaker Group 15

367. Congresswoman Woolsey, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. Well, Sergeant Pennison, I'll leave you more time for your cover-up if you want.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. I mean, it doesn't sound like you feel like you're finished, but I did have a question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. You mentioned sodium pentothal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. Yes, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. Was that administered during your VA as part of the hypnosis or during the intelligence control or the OSI?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. In 1994, when I was out of the service, retired, I went to a therapist and she put me under that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. And that's when you told your story, went way back and told the whole thing that you had?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. That's correct, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. And it said that I had additional visits and being interrogated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. And that's where they came out about the sodium pentothal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. It wasn't a memory that I had.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. Oh, so the sodium pentothal was when?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. When to the hypnosis in 1994 that was done on February 1st, 1981, or there about give or take a few days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. During the OSI interrogation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. Yes, but I knew all the OSI agents.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. These individuals were not OSI.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. They were American.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

386. One was British.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. The interrogation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. That seems a little strange, didn't that make you feel like you were the guilty one?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. Like something happened and you made it, wouldn't you have told them everything you knew without it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. Well, it shouldn't surprise you, ma'am, that the government's not always honest.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. We wanted it to go away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. They said that if we went and were completely honest with them and upfront, this would go away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. Great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. That's what we wanted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. But it didn't go away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. Apparently, on our hypnosis, they continued to go ahead and interrogate us like we're prisoners of war.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. As a matter of fact, I think there's laws against doing that to prisoners of war, okay?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. The sodium pentothal, I must agree to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. I don't think they would have just gave it to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. I'm thinking, I can guess.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. I can say, well, maybe they wanted to make sure I was telling the truth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. Maybe that was it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. Maybe they want to make sure that this wasn't a fabrication of a story or something like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. Maybe that's what they wanted to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. But on our hypnosis, it came out to be more of a they knew things and there's things they wanted to know that didn't seem to make any difference to anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. But they had a general knowledge that this has been going on for a while and there's been a concerted effort to deceive the people on it, the public.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. And do you want to offer any more on that subject of deceiving the copyright?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. Well, I'm not sure who was actually in charge pulling the strings on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. I don't know if it was the NSA.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. I don't know if it was DIS, Defense Intelligence Service.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. They were down at Chicksands, which is 50 miles away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. So I'm not exactly sure who they were.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. I don't even know if they were from the embassy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. They could have been State Department, who knows?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. But the other thing is that most of the people all PCS'd, permanent change of station, within three months of the incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. I'm not saying it was something that was by design.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. I'm saying that's what happened, though.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. Myself, on February 1st, I got promotion.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. I became the non-commissioned officer in charge of plans and programs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. We wrote top-seeker plans, contingency planning, those kind of things for time-phased appointment listings, stuff like that, and how we'd fight the war and different wars and different scenarios.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. And I wrote the base security plans, and I worked under the direct observation in some capacity of the base commander.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. Why would that happen?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. I didn't know nothing about plans and programs, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. I was a security force member.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. They said, "Well, we'll educate you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. We'll send you there for the next six months of classes or something."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. They wanted to watch me, so I stayed there with Colonel Halt until 1984.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. And of course, I hear scuttlebutt.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. I hear people talking about the UFO incident and that, but there are people that weren't going to know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. They just, you know, they were just listening to the false information that was put out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. You have anything to add?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. I'd like to add a couple things of note that stands out to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. Number one, the State Department admits that there was something went on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. And by doing that, there was an international incident involved, because why else would the Department of State be briefed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. The OSI oversees reports to the Department of State.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. They don't report to local authorities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. You know, in the states, it's a little bit different setup.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. So immediately, the Department of State was briefed on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. Why would they be briefed on this if nothing of significance took place?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. From that point, I've had the privilege of sitting down face to face with General Williams, Colonel Conrad, and Colonel Halt.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. Colonel Halt's on the record saying that he was aware that we were brought in and interrogated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. He was aware that we were not treated properly and that there was drugs, or in his words, we were messed with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. That's where my problem starts with my chain of command.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. Where were they for us when they knew this was going on and why didn't they stop it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. General Williams, who we had a face to face with, said he tried to help us, but when our attorney contacted him and asked if he'd go on a record and do a statement as sworn subpoena, he said he'd have memory problems, that he would fail to forget -- he would have a problem remembering everything that went on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. Colonel Conrad was most concerned about the fact that Colonel Halt has been on the record on a lot of this stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. He said he violated the code of conduct by an officer, that basically he was out there talking about something that should stay quiet and remain classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. We clearly understand the fact that even in your position as you are given information is deemed national defense and classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. But what wasn't taken into effect, again, is what I stressed earlier, was a human factor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. And does it really matter what we was deemed classified and that it needs to be maintained and held back from the general public?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. Why were we not given the care that we were supposed to receive and why weren't we at least briefed a little bit on what we were dealing with?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. Because besides the physical problems, which I have a pacemaker defibrillator in me now at 52, we are still puzzled by what we were dealing with and why it happened to us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. I'll yield back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. I'm sure I've used all my time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. Thank you, gentlemen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. Senator Gravel?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. To your knowledge, were there any nuclear storage facilities within the area?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. I can neither confirm nor deny that, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. What do you mean you can't confirm?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. Forget the classification stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. This is quite a number of years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. And just so you're comfortable, I was in the CIC in the Army, which is the equivalent of your OSI, and we interfaced with them greatly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. So my question again is that you have knowledge that there was any storage area, and maybe Mr. Polk can elaborate upon it, that there may have been a conflict.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. You're not going to get any answers on me, so you better...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. Go ahead, Nick.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. You can explain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. Nick, you step forward.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. You're a foreigner.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. We're not going to do anything to you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. Was there an issue over nuclear storage and what was being stored?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. Well, sir, I checked the position with the Ministry of Defense Press Office, because this is a question that comes up from time to time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. And I was told that if that question is asked, even about a historical incident, the British government's line on that is still, "Neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. However, sir...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. Please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. Let's put the crap aside now and talk mono-amano.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. While I can't answer that question, I would refer you to, again, what Lord Hill Norton as the former Chief of the Defense Staff, which is the UK equivalent of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. What did he say?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. Basically, he said, "Look, this was a nuclear base."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. So that's what the Chief of the Defense Staff said and the Chairman of the Military Committee.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

484. Do you realize that all of that hoopla was over the fact that they didn't want the British people to know that we were storing nukes over there and that they would be reacting to it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. That's what this is all about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. But the tie-in for us here is the fact that you had extraterrestrial interest, which seems to be in what readings I've done in preparation for the hearing, that there's a lot of this stuff that was going on with ICBMs not functioning when these extraterrestrials are around and they take an interest, particularly...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. We had this yesterday in New Mexico, which was the center of our "defense posture" in that regard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. That seems to be why they had an interest in it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. So this is not rocket science and this is not terribly secret.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. The public knows about this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. This has been highly discussed in international and political science records all over.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

492. We still had this problem in Okinawa.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. We still had this problem why we took nukes out of South Korea, because that's what triggered the North Koreans to start going nuke, was because we had nukes in the peninsula.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. And of course we still have nukes in Europe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. So we can all bury our heads in the sand and say, "Oh, this is ha-ha, this is big secret."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. It's not a big secret.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. We know it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. What's the secret is the treatment of people like yourself who are just doing your job at a level and then everybody in the chain of command are just lying through their teeth in what they think are good reasons, "Does this increase the defense of our country?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

499. I don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

500. But here, you answered my question so that you didn't have to say it, somebody else said it of record that there were nukes in, but I don't know about the others, but I certainly knew about it and I've been out of office for 40 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. Now let me reiterate, is there anything you want to fess up that you'll feel comfortable with and sleep better tonight if you tell us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

502. Because there's no danger to you, trust me, there is no danger to you in this regard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

503. You're out of the service, I don't know what you signed when you're there, but you have a moral responsibility like anybody else to tell the truth or share your knowledge with us because that's what we're all trying to get to, is a level of knowledge to the public so there'll be a reaction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. Let me just intervene right here, Senator, contrary to some of the things that you said and we do want the truth as much as we can get it, but what we don't want to jeopardize anybody's safety or anything else, benefits included.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. So I think we're going to leave that chain of thought right there and let it just lay because what I don't want to see and as members of Congress, we have a classification, but there are two or three levels over us that we don't have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. So you need to know that as well, there's different levels of, and I don't, whatever you said 35 years ago, I want, and that oath you took and signed that paper and gave them this instead of that, I think we've heard that, we've worked that enough today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. But I want you to change, just change, change to continue, but just go somewhere else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

508. Well, but let me dispute that a little bit, Congressman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

509. First off, as far as I'm concerned, the members of Congress have the highest degree of classification of what's secret.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. Now, I'm not talking about order of battle where troops are put at risk because somebody blabs about something, but when I'm talking about, here, I'll give you an example.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. I had Edward Teller, I was a Senator for 30 days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. Edward Teller is sitting in my office, and I barely passed Physics 101, and here's this awesome person, Edward Teller, trying to persuade me on an ABM system.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. And all I could think of was when I'm listening to him talk was that he probably knows more than I will ever know, or he's forgotten more than I will ever know on physics and the bomb and the nuclear stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. But I'll tell you, I'm equal to him or to superior to him in the determination of whether we will use the bomb, period.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. And that goes for the members of Congress, and so when we talk about that we're bound by secrecy, let me tell you again, there's a Supreme Court decision, 1972, that any member of Congress can release any information on any subject of any classification level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. I don't care if it's cosmic and cannot be questioned in any other location.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. That is the law of the land based on the Constitution and a Supreme Court backup decision on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

518. So we may have our differences in that regard, but I'll be happy to terminate it on that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. But let me again, if you want to share something that you're feeling comfortable about, about the secrecy, the cover-up, please feel free to do so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

520. But if you don't feel comfortable about doing that, fine, I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. All I can say, sir, is I believe we're going to continue with our quest.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. We believe we will expose more things as we go along, things that we can verify as factual.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. And we promise you anything that we come up with will be made available to you to help us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. Great.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

527. Thank you, Senator.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

528. You're very welcome.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. Congressman Cook has just asked for a brief moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

530. Let me give him a minute, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. I would just like 30 seconds, I appreciate the chair's indulgence, to whether senators I respect more than any, I was a fan of him when I was in college, of Senator Gravel here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. He's a wonderful man.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. But I would take on what he said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. I think there is some danger to you in going beyond what might be protected from a member, you know, from our standpoint as former members of Congress or even as members of Congress, you may not have those same protections.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. So I advise you to listen to Mr. Frascogna on these kinds of questions rather than any one of us who are not experts on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. But you don't, I mean, you guys still have oaths of office.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. We understand that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. And oaths of...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

539. Points well taken.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. Well taken.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
