379. It wasn't a memory that I had.
→ {"text": "這不是我原本擁有的記憶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

380. Oh, so the sodium pentothal was when?
→ {"text": "哦，所以硫噴妥鈉是在什麼時候施用的？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. The interrogation.
→ {"text": "這次審訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. That seems a little strange, didn't that make you feel like you were the guilty one?
→ {"text": "這似乎有點奇怪，那不會讓您覺得自己像是有罪的一方嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. Like something happened and you made it, wouldn't you have told them everything you knew without it?
→ {"text": "就像是發生了什麼事而您製造了事件一樣，如果不用藥物，您難道不會把知道的一切都告訴他們嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文語意略為模糊"}

→ {"text": "顯然，從催眠中得知，他們繼續審訊我們，就像我們是戰俘一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. As a matter of fact, I think there's laws against doing that to prisoners of war, okay?

407. But on our hypnosis, it came out to be more of a they knew things and there's things they wanted to know that didn't seem to make any difference to anything.
→ {"text": "但從催眠中顯示，他們已經知道一些事情，而他們想知道的其他事情似乎對任何事情都沒有影響。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. But they had a general knowledge that this has been going on for a while and there's been a concerted effort to deceive the people on it, the public.
→ {"text": "但他們大致知道這種情況已經持續了一段時間，而且一直有協同一致的努力在欺騙大眾。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. And do you want to offer any more on that subject of deceiving the copyright?
→ {"text": "您還想就欺騙公眾這個主題多說些什麼嗎？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文 'copyright' 應為 'public' 的口誤"}

410. Well, I'm not sure who was actually in charge pulling the strings on this.

→ {"text": "這就是國防參謀長和軍事委員會主席所說的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

484. Do you realize that all of that hoopla was over the fact that they didn't want the British people to know that we were storing nukes over there and that they would be reacting to it?
→ {"text": "你們意識到所有這些大驚小怪都是因為他們不想讓英國人民知道我們在那裡儲存核武器，以及他們會對此做出反應嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

485. That's what this is all about.
→ {"text": "這就是整件事的核心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

486. But the tie-in for us here is the fact that you had extraterrestrial interest, which seems to be in what readings I've done in preparation for the hearing, that there's a lot of this stuff that was going on with ICBMs not functioning when these extraterrestrials are around and they take an interest, particularly...

→ {"text": "昨天我們在新墨西哥州也聽到這樣的證詞，那裡是我們在這方面的「防禦態勢」中心。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

488. That seems to be why they had an interest in it.

489. So this is not rocket science and this is not terribly secret.
→ {"text": "所以這並不複雜，也不是什麼天大的秘密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文已修正為 'rocket science'（常用成語，意為「不複雜」）"}

492. We still had this problem in Okinawa.
→ {"text": "我們在沖繩仍然有這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

493. We still had this problem why we took nukes out of South Korea, because that's what triggered the North Koreans to start going nuke, was because we had nukes in the peninsula.

494. And of course we still have nukes in Europe.

→ {"text": "這根本不是什麼大秘密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

497. We know it.
→ {"text": "我們都知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

498. What's the secret is the treatment of people like yourself who are just doing your job at a level and then everybody in the chain of command are just lying through their teeth in what they think are good reasons, "Does this increase the defense of our country?"
→ {"text": "真正的秘密是對像你們這樣只是在盡職工作的人的對待方式，然後指揮鏈中的每個人都在他們認為是正當理由的情況下撒謊：「這能增強我們國家的防禦嗎？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

499. I don't know.
→ {"text": "我不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

500. But here, you answered my question so that you didn't have to say it, somebody else said it of record that there were nukes in, but I don't know about the others, but I certainly knew about it and I've been out of office for 40 years.
→ {"text": "但在這裡，你回答了我的問題，所以你不必親口說出來，別人已經正式記錄在案說那裡有核武器，但我不知道其他人是否知道，但我肯定知道，而我已經離開公職40年了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

501. Now let me reiterate, is there anything you want to fess up that you'll feel comfortable with and sleep better tonight if you tell us?
→ {"text": "現在讓我重申一下，有什麼事情是你想坦白的，說出來後你會覺得更自在，今晚能睡得更好？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
