## Speaker Group 1

49. Attorney?
→ {"text": "律師先生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. Counselor?
→ {"text": "法律顧問？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. Anything you want to add?
→ {"text": "您有什麼要補充的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. Madam Chair, thank you.
→ {"text": "主席女士，謝謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. I have to say that as far as the importance of the evidence or what I can say about that is this.
→ {"text": "關於證據的重要性，我必須這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. The first several many years of my legal career was spent as a public defender, and as such, I went to court every day as the underdog, pretty much, and oftentimes didn't have any real evidence in my favor other than human testimony, witness testimony.
→ {"text": "我法律生涯的前幾年是擔任公設辯護人，因此我幾乎每天都以弱勢一方的身份出庭，而且通常除了人證、目擊證詞之外，我手上沒有任何對我有利的實質證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "public defender 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「公設辯護人」"}

56. And I gained a respect for, much like I'm sure each of you have through hearings such as this today, that the testimony that you hear from your fellow man or woman can be just as good if not better than documentary evidence much of the time.
→ {"text": "因此我學會尊重證人證詞的價值，就像我相信各位今天透過這樣的聽證會也會有同樣的體會——來自同胞的證詞，在很多時候與書面證據同樣有力，甚至更有說服力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. In this particular case, I have had the privilege of being privy to some conversations that John and Jim have had with some of the folks, rather, we've spoken about today, some of those rather high-ranking people, and nobody's telling or describing the sight of the smoking gun to this, but just by what they say and how they react to certain questions and what they might add to an answer at the very end that they give it some thought tends to point in a certain direction.
→ {"text": "在這個案件中，我有幸得以參與 John 和 Jim 與我們今天談到的一些人士——其中一些是相當高階的人物——的部分對話。雖然沒有人直接告訴我們或描述確鿿的證據，但僅從他們的言談、他們對某些問題的反應方式，以及他們在深思熟慮後可能在回答最後補充的內容，都指向某個特定的方向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. All the arrows point in one direction, and that's not necessarily ET or Black Ops Project, but it points to something very strange, and I've seen that a number of times.
→ {"text": "所有的線索都指向同一個方向，而那不一定是外星人或黑色行動專案，但確實指向某種非常奇異的事物，我已經多次看到這種情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Black Ops Project 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「黑色行動專案」"}

59. But I guess I would say that if this were a case, if I went back to be that Young Republic defender I was so many years ago, this would have been one of my best criminal cases to take because the testimony is all there for me to win that case, absolutely.
→ {"text": "但我想說的是，如果這是一個案件，如果我回到多年前那個年輕的公設辯護人身份，這將會是我接手過最好打的刑事案件之一，因為我有充分的證詞可以贏得這個案子，絕對沒問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. The main thing you'd be dealing with today that you would not be if they weren't not military and regular citizens is the military, which is much of what this whole disclosure hearing is about.
→ {"text": "今天您要面對的主要問題，是如果他們不是軍人而是普通公民就不會遇到的——那就是軍方，而這正是整個真相揭露聽證會的核心議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Disclosure 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「真相揭露」"}

61. But that's good, and we commend you for that.
→ {"text": "但這很好，我們對此表示讚賞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. Public defenders are major in our society, and when you have a passion that I feel from you for them, they get good representation, so thank you very much.
→ {"text": "公設辯護人在我們社會中扮演重要角色，當您對他們懷有我所感受到的那種熱情時，當事人就能獲得良好的法律代理，非常感謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. Mr. Pendleton, would you like to add anything else before I go to my members here?
→ {"text": "Penniston 先生，在我讓其他委員發言之前，您還有什麼要補充的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文誤拼為Pendleton，實為Penniston"}


## Speaker Group 2

64. Do you have any questions that -- I was wondering, are your questions going to go into the cover-up?
→ {"text": "您有什麼問題——我想知道，您的問題會涉及真相掩蓋嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Cover-up 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「真相掩蓋」"}


## Speaker Group 3

65. We'll have to see.
→ {"text": "我們拭目以待。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. Each of these members are leaders in their own right, but they're all going to get a chance.
→ {"text": "在座的每位委員都是各自領域的領袖，他們都會有機會發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. They're going to get some, because, you know, we could be here, you know, they'll come to it, though.
→ {"text": "他們會問到的，因為，你知道，我們可能會在這裡待很久，不過他們最終會問到這個問題的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. Did you want to say something about the cover-up?
→ {"text": "您想談談真相掩蓋的事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

69. Well, it's -- it'll take -- it'll take quite a while, that's why.
→ {"text": "嗯，這——這會花很長時間，這就是為什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

70. Well, I want you to paraphrase, because one thing about it, you've lived it, you were there, you're here with us today, and whatever you'd like to offer, you should start.
→ {"text": "好吧，我希望您簡要說明，因為有一點很重要——您親身經歷過，您當時在場，今天您也在這裡和我們在一起，無論您想提供什麼資訊，您都應該開始說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

71. I think that in a -- because of the culture and the environment at the time of the Air Force after Blue Book, it wasn't prudent or good career moves to be talking about any type of phenomenon or UFOs or things like that.
→ {"text": "我認為——由於當時空軍在藍皮書計畫之後的文化和環境，談論任何類型的異常現象或不明飛行物之類的事情，並不明智，也不利於職業發展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Blue Book 指美國空軍的 UFO 調查計畫「藍皮書計畫」"}

72. It just wasn't a good idea for your career.
→ {"text": "這對你的職業生涯來說就是不明智的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. So when John and I left that for us that night, we were discussing, well, how far do we go with this?
→ {"text": "所以當 John 和我那晚離開現場時，我們在討論，我們該把這件事說到什麼程度？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. And tell them everything?
→ {"text": "要把一切都告訴他們嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. You know, well, it would be pretty much a career ender, we were thinking that.
→ {"text": "你知道，我們當時想，這幾乎會斷送我們的職業生涯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. So we reported in the next day with our shift commander the morning after, and we told him about what happened, and he questioned us on it, and we were somewhat sanitized.
→ {"text": "所以第二天早上我們向值班指揮官報告，告訴他發生了什麼事，他對我們進行了詢問，我們的說法多少有些刪減。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "sanitized 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「刪減的」"}

77. I mean, instead of being up next to a craft, I was at a distance, you know, it was metallic, you know, those kind of things.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我沒說自己靠近飛行器，而是說我在遠處，你知道，說它是金屬的，諸如此類的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. And he says, "This is just not a good idea to report this."
→ {"text": "然後他說：「報告這件事真的不是個好主意。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. He says, "I think we should let it go -- you know, just let it go away."
→ {"text": "他說：「我認為我們應該放下這件事——你知道，就讓它過去吧。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. So when I was taken down to OSI, I called on the OSI to make my report, I went in there, and the thoughts of preserving my career were -- they went away, because I was scared to death of the OSI.
→ {"text": "所以當我被帶到特別調查處，我被叫去特別調查處做報告時，我進去那裡，保住職業生涯的念頭——那些念頭都消失了，因為我對特別調查處感到非常害怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "OSI 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「特別調查處」"}

81. They were just threatening me down there.
→ {"text": "他們在那裡威脅我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. They said, you know, in the way they do it, it's a good cop, bad cop, that kind of thing.
→ {"text": "你知道，他們用那種方式，就是一個唱白臉、一個唱黑臉，那種套路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. And I went down there, and they said, "If you write everything that happened, don't leave anything out, this goes away."
→ {"text": "我去到那裡，他們說：「如果你把發生的一切都寫下來，不要遺漏任何事情，這件事就會過去。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. Okay, that's exactly what I want to have happen.
→ {"text": "好的，那正是我希望發生的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. I want this to go away.
→ {"text": "我希望這件事就此過去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. And so I did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. I wrote out four long pages of documents, my statement on the legal paper.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. They came back in about 20, 25 minutes, and they have a typed half-page document that is out now on the Internet, and they say it's my statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

89. History Channel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. The History Channel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

91. They're out all over it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. It's not my statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. In there it says that I got within 50 feet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. It says it's a metallic object, and it's very, very, very general.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. And the agent says -- and I'm not sure if these are OSI agents, but I was in the OSI building.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. Let me clarify that too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. I knew all the agents, but I didn't know these people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. And they said, "Okay, read this statement."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. And I said, "Okay."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. And he said, "Read it again."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. I said, "Okay."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. And they said, "We want you to memorize it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. Read it again."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. I said, "Okay."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. And he said, "This is the official statement that you're going to give your command element or anybody else from this point on that asks about it, because this is a classified investigation, and OSI can operate outside the chain of command.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. They do it over in England.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. At that time they actually worked for the State Department."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. And I said, "Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. No problem."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. General orders by -- because it's an active investigation by whoever those are -- people in front of me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. And so that's why I report to the Wing Commander.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. He doesn't even blink an eye when General Williams does it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. He said, "Listen --" General Williams is the Wing Commander at that point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. General -- Major General Williams, that's what he -- at the time he was Colonel Williams.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. You retired a Major General.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. And when we reported into Colonel Halt's office, I briefly talked to Colonel Conrad, who was the base commander at the time -- Colonel Halt worked for him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. And then John and I met up there, and then we went in and talked to the Wing Commander -- reported into the Wing Commander -- and explained the -- I gave him the OSI statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. I mean, I told him that's what happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. It was general, and he thanked us very much for our time and told us that he appreciated the candor that we had.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. And he never asked one question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. And so there's where the cover-up probably started.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. It started by the issuance of that statement from OSI.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. You submitted -- Sergeant, you submitted that statement, so it really kind of started as you were writing the statement and submitting it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. Well, when I wrote the four pages -- I'll let me make that clear, ma'am -- when I wrote them out, I was in detail.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. I wrote down everything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. But that wasn't what you submitted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. You submitted what they asked you to submit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. I gave them everything they wanted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. They said write every detail down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. Four pages?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. Four pages.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. And I wrote the fact about the temperature, about it being on the ground, the glyphs, the notes from my notebook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. They were included.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. I didn't have my notebook there, but all that stuff was included, including the binary code, which I called ones and zeros in because I'm not a math person.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. And at that time -- And did you give that to the wing commander?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. I gave that to the OSI building.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. Did you give that to the wing commander?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. No, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. What I gave to the wing commander was the OSI sanitized statement and the one that I was supposed to give them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. And why did you not give that one to the wing commander?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. Because I was under orders from -- because OSI said it was an ongoing investigation and they can work outside the realm of the base commander, wing commander and everything else like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. And my position is, new with this and all that, that might have been the beginning of the cover-up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. I agree.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. And I don't want to badger you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. Appreciate your service, trying times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. How many years ago was this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. This is '80 and this is now '13.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. That's 23, 33 years ago, so no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. That you're still standing in relatively good health, thank God for that and we'll see what we can do with you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. Thank you, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. Thank you, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
