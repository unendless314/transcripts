## Speaker Group 1

49. Attorney?
→ {"text": "律師先生？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

50. Counselor?
→ {"text": "法律顧問？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

51. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

52. Anything you want to add?
→ {"text": "您有什麼要補充的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

53. Madam Chair, thank you.
→ {"text": "主席女士，謝謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

54. I have to say that as far as the importance of the evidence or what I can say about that is this.
→ {"text": "關於證據的重要性，我必須這麼說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

55. The first several many years of my legal career was spent as a public defender, and as such, I went to court every day as the underdog, pretty much, and oftentimes didn't have any real evidence in my favor other than human testimony, witness testimony.
→ {"text": "我法律生涯的前幾年是擔任公設辯護人，因此我幾乎每天都以弱勢一方的身份出庭，而且通常除了人證、目擊證詞之外，我手上沒有任何對我有利的實質證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "public defender 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「公設辯護人」"}

56. And I gained a respect for, much like I'm sure each of you have through hearings such as this today, that the testimony that you hear from your fellow man or woman can be just as good if not better than documentary evidence much of the time.
→ {"text": "因此我學會尊重證人證詞的價值，就像我相信各位今天透過這樣的聽證會也會有同樣的體會——來自同胞的證詞，在很多時候與書面證據同樣有力，甚至更有說服力。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

57. In this particular case, I have had the privilege of being privy to some conversations that John and Jim have had with some of the folks, rather, we've spoken about today, some of those rather high-ranking people, and nobody's telling or describing the sight of the smoking gun to this, but just by what they say and how they react to certain questions and what they might add to an answer at the very end that they give it some thought tends to point in a certain direction.
→ {"text": "在這個案件中，我有幸得以參與 John 和 Jim 與我們今天談到的一些人士——其中一些是相當高階的人物——的部分對話。雖然沒有人直接告訴我們或描述確鿿的證據，但僅從他們的言談、他們對某些問題的反應方式，以及他們在深思熟慮後可能在回答最後補充的內容，都指向某個特定的方向。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

58. All the arrows point in one direction, and that's not necessarily ET or Black Ops Project, but it points to something very strange, and I've seen that a number of times.
→ {"text": "所有的線索都指向同一個方向，而那不一定是外星人或黑色行動專案，但確實指向某種非常奇異的事物，我已經多次看到這種情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Black Ops Project 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「黑色行動專案」"}

59. But I guess I would say that if this were a case, if I went back to be that Young Republic defender I was so many years ago, this would have been one of my best criminal cases to take because the testimony is all there for me to win that case, absolutely.
→ {"text": "但我想說的是，如果這是一個案件，如果我回到多年前那個年輕的公設辯護人身份，這將會是我接手過最好打的刑事案件之一，因為我有充分的證詞可以贏得這個案子，絕對沒問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

60. The main thing you'd be dealing with today that you would not be if they weren't not military and regular citizens is the military, which is much of what this whole disclosure hearing is about.
→ {"text": "今天您要面對的主要問題，是如果他們不是軍人而是普通公民就不會遇到的——那就是軍方，而這正是整個真相揭露聽證會的核心議題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Disclosure 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「真相揭露」"}

61. But that's good, and we commend you for that.
→ {"text": "但這很好，我們對此表示讚賞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

62. Public defenders are major in our society, and when you have a passion that I feel from you for them, they get good representation, so thank you very much.
→ {"text": "公設辯護人在我們社會中扮演重要角色，當您對他們懷有我所感受到的那種熱情時，當事人就能獲得良好的法律代理，非常感謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

63. Mr. Pendleton, would you like to add anything else before I go to my members here?
→ {"text": "Penniston 先生，在我讓其他委員發言之前，您還有什麼要補充的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文誤拼為Pendleton，實為Penniston"}


## Speaker Group 2

64. Do you have any questions that -- I was wondering, are your questions going to go into the cover-up?
→ {"text": "您有什麼問題——我想知道，您的問題會涉及真相掩蓋嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Cover-up 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「真相掩蓋」"}


## Speaker Group 3

65. We'll have to see.
→ {"text": "我們拭目以待。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

66. Each of these members are leaders in their own right, but they're all going to get a chance.
→ {"text": "在座的每位委員都是各自領域的領袖，他們都會有機會發言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

67. They're going to get some, because, you know, we could be here, you know, they'll come to it, though.
→ {"text": "他們會問到的，因為，你知道，我們可能會在這裡待很久，不過他們最終會問到這個問題的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

68. Did you want to say something about the cover-up?
→ {"text": "您想談談真相掩蓋的事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

69. Well, it's -- it'll take -- it'll take quite a while, that's why.
→ {"text": "嗯，這——這會花很長時間，這就是為什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

70. Well, I want you to paraphrase, because one thing about it, you've lived it, you were there, you're here with us today, and whatever you'd like to offer, you should start.
→ {"text": "好吧，我希望您簡要說明，因為有一點很重要——您親身經歷過，您當時在場，今天您也在這裡和我們在一起，無論您想提供什麼資訊，您都應該開始說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

71. I think that in a -- because of the culture and the environment at the time of the Air Force after Blue Book, it wasn't prudent or good career moves to be talking about any type of phenomenon or UFOs or things like that.
→ {"text": "我認為——由於當時空軍在藍皮書計畫之後的文化和環境，談論任何類型的異常現象或不明飛行物之類的事情，並不明智，也不利於職業發展。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Blue Book 指美國空軍的 UFO 調查計畫「藍皮書計畫」"}

72. It just wasn't a good idea for your career.
→ {"text": "這對你的職業生涯來說就是不明智的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

73. So when John and I left that for us that night, we were discussing, well, how far do we go with this?
→ {"text": "所以當 John 和我那晚離開現場時，我們在討論，我們該把這件事說到什麼程度？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

74. And tell them everything?
→ {"text": "要把一切都告訴他們嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

75. You know, well, it would be pretty much a career ender, we were thinking that.
→ {"text": "你知道，我們當時想，這幾乎會斷送我們的職業生涯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

76. So we reported in the next day with our shift commander the morning after, and we told him about what happened, and he questioned us on it, and we were somewhat sanitized.
→ {"text": "所以第二天早上我們向值班指揮官報告，告訴他發生了什麼事，他對我們進行了詢問，我們的說法多少有些刪減。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "sanitized 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「刪減的」"}

77. I mean, instead of being up next to a craft, I was at a distance, you know, it was metallic, you know, those kind of things.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我沒說自己靠近飛行器，而是說我在遠處，你知道，說它是金屬的，諸如此類的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

78. And he says, "This is just not a good idea to report this."
→ {"text": "然後他說：「報告這件事真的不是個好主意。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

79. He says, "I think we should let it go -- you know, just let it go away."
→ {"text": "他說：「我認為我們應該放下這件事——你知道，就讓它過去吧。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

80. So when I was taken down to OSI, I called on the OSI to make my report, I went in there, and the thoughts of preserving my career were -- they went away, because I was scared to death of the OSI.
→ {"text": "所以當我被帶到特別調查處，我被叫去特別調查處做報告時，我進去那裡，保住職業生涯的念頭——那些念頭都消失了，因為我對特別調查處感到非常害怕。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "OSI 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「特別調查處」"}

81. They were just threatening me down there.
→ {"text": "他們在那裡威脅我。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

82. They said, you know, in the way they do it, it's a good cop, bad cop, that kind of thing.
→ {"text": "你知道，他們用那種方式，就是一個唱白臉、一個唱黑臉，那種套路。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

83. And I went down there, and they said, "If you write everything that happened, don't leave anything out, this goes away."
→ {"text": "我去到那裡，他們說：「如果你把發生的一切都寫下來，不要遺漏任何事情，這件事就會過去。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

84. Okay, that's exactly what I want to have happen.
→ {"text": "好的，那正是我希望發生的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

85. I want this to go away.
→ {"text": "我希望這件事就此過去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

86. And so I did.
→ {"text": "於是我照做了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

87. I wrote out four long pages of documents, my statement on the legal paper.
→ {"text": "我在法律用紙上寫了整整四頁的文件，我的陳述。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

88. They came back in about 20, 25 minutes, and they have a typed half-page document that is out now on the Internet, and they say it's my statement.
→ {"text": "他們大約 20、25 分鐘後回來，拿著一份打字的半頁文件，現在這份文件在網路上流傳，他們說這是我的陳述。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

89. History Channel.
→ {"text": "歷史頻道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

90. The History Channel.
→ {"text": "歷史頻道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

91. They're out all over it.
→ {"text": "到處都有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

92. It's not my statement.
→ {"text": "那不是我的陳述。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

93. In there it says that I got within 50 feet.
→ {"text": "裡面說我接近到 50 英呎內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

94. It says it's a metallic object, and it's very, very, very general.
→ {"text": "它說那是一個金屬物體，而且非常、非常、非常籠統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

95. And the agent says -- and I'm not sure if these are OSI agents, but I was in the OSI building.
→ {"text": "然後那個特工說——我不確定這些人是不是特別調查處的特工，但我是在特別調查處的建築裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

96. Let me clarify that too.
→ {"text": "讓我也澄清這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

97. I knew all the agents, but I didn't know these people.
→ {"text": "我認識所有的特工，但我不認識這些人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

98. And they said, "Okay, read this statement."
→ {"text": "然後他們說：「好，讀這份陳述。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

99. And I said, "Okay."
→ {"text": "我說：「好的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

100. And he said, "Read it again."
→ {"text": "他說：「再讀一遍。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

101. I said, "Okay."
→ {"text": "我說：「好的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

102. And they said, "We want you to memorize it.
→ {"text": "然後他們說：「我們要你把它背下來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

103. Read it again."
→ {"text": "再讀一遍。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

104. I said, "Okay."
→ {"text": "我說：「好的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

105. And he said, "This is the official statement that you're going to give your command element or anybody else from this point on that asks about it, because this is a classified investigation, and OSI can operate outside the chain of command.
→ {"text": "他說：「從現在開始，這就是你要向你的指揮系統或任何其他詢問此事的人所提供的官方陳述，因為這是機密調查，而特別調查處可以在指揮鏈之外運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Classified 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「機密」"}

106. They do it over in England.
→ {"text": "他們在英國就是這樣運作的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

107. At that time they actually worked for the State Department."
→ {"text": "當時他們實際上是為國務院工作的。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": "State Department 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「國務院」"}

108. And I said, "Okay.
→ {"text": "我說：「好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

109. No problem."
→ {"text": "沒問題。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

110. General orders by -- because it's an active investigation by whoever those are -- people in front of me.
→ {"text": "將軍的命令——因為這是由我面前這些人——不管他們是誰——進行的積極調查。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

111. And so that's why I report to the Wing Commander.
→ {"text": "所以這就是為什麼我向聯隊指揮官報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Wing Commander 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「聯隊指揮官」"}

112. He doesn't even blink an eye when General Williams does it.
→ {"text": "當 Williams 將軍這樣做時，他甚至眼睛都不眨一下。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

113. He said, "Listen --" General Williams is the Wing Commander at that point.
→ {"text": "他說：「聽著——」Williams 將軍當時是聯隊指揮官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

114. General -- Major General Williams, that's what he -- at the time he was Colonel Williams.
→ {"text": "將軍——Williams 少將，那是他——當時他是 Williams 上校。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "根據 terminology.yaml，Colonel Williams 後來晉升為 Major General Williams"}

115. You retired a Major General.
→ {"text": "您是以少將軍階退伍的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

116. And when we reported into Colonel Halt's office, I briefly talked to Colonel Conrad, who was the base commander at the time -- Colonel Halt worked for him.
→ {"text": "當我們向 Halt 上校的辦公室報告時，我簡短地與 Conrad 上校交談，他當時是基地指揮官——Halt 上校在他手下工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "根據 terminology.yaml，Colonel Halt 是副基地指揮官，Colonel Conrad 是基地指揮官"}

117. And then John and I met up there, and then we went in and talked to the Wing Commander -- reported into the Wing Commander -- and explained the -- I gave him the OSI statement.
→ {"text": "然後 John 和我在那裡會合，接著我們進去與聯隊指揮官交談——向聯隊指揮官報告——並解釋——我給了他特別調查處的陳述。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

118. I mean, I told him that's what happened.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我告訴他那就是發生的事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

119. It was general, and he thanked us very much for our time and told us that he appreciated the candor that we had.
→ {"text": "內容很籠統，他非常感謝我們的時間，並告訴我們他很感激我們的坦誠。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

120. And he never asked one question.
→ {"text": "而他從頭到尾沒問一個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

121. And so there's where the cover-up probably started.
→ {"text": "所以真相掩蓋可能就是從那裡開始的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

122. It started by the issuance of that statement from OSI.
→ {"text": "它始於特別調查處發布的那份陳述。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

123. You submitted -- Sergeant, you submitted that statement, so it really kind of started as you were writing the statement and submitting it.
→ {"text": "您提交了——中士，您提交了那份陳述，所以它實際上是在您撰寫和提交陳述時就開始了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

124. Well, when I wrote the four pages -- I'll let me make that clear, ma'am -- when I wrote them out, I was in detail.
→ {"text": "嗯，當我寫那四頁——讓我說清楚，女士——當我寫出來時，我寫得非常詳細。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

125. I wrote down everything.
→ {"text": "我寫下了一切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

126. But that wasn't what you submitted.
→ {"text": "但那不是您提交的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

127. You submitted what they asked you to submit.
→ {"text": "您提交的是他們要求您提交的內容。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

128. I gave them everything they wanted.
→ {"text": "我給了他們所有他們想要的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

129. They said write every detail down.
→ {"text": "他們說要寫下每個細節。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

130. Four pages?
→ {"text": "四頁？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

131. Four pages.
→ {"text": "四頁。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

132. And I wrote the fact about the temperature, about it being on the ground, the glyphs, the notes from my notebook.
→ {"text": "我寫了關於溫度的事實、關於它在地面上、符號、我筆記本上的記錄。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

133. They were included.
→ {"text": "這些都包括在內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

134. I didn't have my notebook there, but all that stuff was included, including the binary code, which I called ones and zeros in because I'm not a math person.
→ {"text": "我當時沒帶筆記本，但所有那些東西都包括在內，包括二進位代碼，我把它稱為一和零，因為我不是數學人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "binary code 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「二進位代碼」"}

135. And at that time -- And did you give that to the wing commander?
→ {"text": "而在那時——您把那個給聯隊指揮官了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

136. I gave that to the OSI building.
→ {"text": "我把那個交給了特別調查處大樓。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

137. Did you give that to the wing commander?
→ {"text": "您把那個給聯隊指揮官了嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

138. No.
→ {"text": "沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

139. No, ma'am.
→ {"text": "沒有，女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

140. What I gave to the wing commander was the OSI sanitized statement and the one that I was supposed to give them.
→ {"text": "我給聯隊指揮官的是特別調查處刪減過的陳述，也就是我應該給他們的那份。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

141. And why did you not give that one to the wing commander?
→ {"text": "那您為什麼沒把那份給聯隊指揮官？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

142. Because I was under orders from -- because OSI said it was an ongoing investigation and they can work outside the realm of the base commander, wing commander and everything else like that.
→ {"text": "因為我接到命令——因為特別調查處說這是正在進行的調查，他們可以在基地指揮官、聯隊指揮官以及其他所有人的權限之外運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

143. And my position is, new with this and all that, that might have been the beginning of the cover-up.
→ {"text": "我的看法是，對這一切還很陌生的我，那可能就是真相掩蓋的開端。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

144. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

145. I agree.
→ {"text": "我同意。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

146. All right.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

147. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

148. And I don't want to badger you.
→ {"text": "我不想糾纏您。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

149. Appreciate your service, trying times.
→ {"text": "感謝您的服務，這是艱難的時刻。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

150. How many years ago was this?
→ {"text": "這是多少年前的事了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

151. This is '80 and this is now '13.
→ {"text": "那是 1980 年，現在是 2013 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

152. That's 23, 33 years ago, so no.
→ {"text": "那是 23、33 年前，所以不。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

153. That you're still standing in relatively good health, thank God for that and we'll see what we can do with you.
→ {"text": "您仍然站在這裡，健康狀況相對良好，感謝上帝，我們會看看能為您做些什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

154. Thank you, ma'am.
→ {"text": "謝謝您，女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

155. Thank you, sir.
→ {"text": "謝謝您，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
