## Speaker Group 1

49. Attorney?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

50. Counselor?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

51. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

52. Anything you want to add?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

53. Madam Chair, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

54. I have to say that as far as the importance of the evidence or what I can say about that is this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

55. The first several many years of my legal career was spent as a public defender, and as such, I went to court every day as the underdog, pretty much, and oftentimes didn't have any real evidence in my favor other than human testimony, witness testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

56. And I gained a respect for, much like I'm sure each of you have through hearings such as this today, that the testimony that you hear from your fellow man or woman can be just as good if not better than documentary evidence much of the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

57. In this particular case, I have had the privilege of being privy to some conversations that John and Jim have had with some of the folks, rather, we've spoken about today, some of those rather high-ranking people, and nobody's telling or describing the sight of the smoking gun to this, but just by what they say and how they react to certain questions and what they might add to an answer at the very end that they give it some thought tends to point in a certain direction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

58. All the arrows point in one direction, and that's not necessarily ET or Black Ops Project, but it points to something very strange, and I've seen that a number of times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

59. But I guess I would say that if this were a case, if I went back to be that Young Republic defender I was so many years ago, this would have been one of my best criminal cases to take because the testimony is all there for me to win that case, absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

60. The main thing you'd be dealing with today that you would not be if they weren't not military and regular citizens is the military, which is much of what this whole disclosure hearing is about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

61. But that's good, and we commend you for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

62. Public defenders are major in our society, and when you have a passion that I feel from you for them, they get good representation, so thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

63. Mr. Pendleton, would you like to add anything else before I go to my members here?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 2

64. Do you have any questions that -- I was wondering, are your questions going to go into the cover-up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 3

65. We'll have to see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

66. Each of these members are leaders in their own right, but they're all going to get a chance.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

67. They're going to get some, because, you know, we could be here, you know, they'll come to it, though.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

68. Did you want to say something about the cover-up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 4

69. Well, it's -- it'll take -- it'll take quite a while, that's why.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 5

70. Well, I want you to paraphrase, because one thing about it, you've lived it, you were there, you're here with us today, and whatever you'd like to offer, you should start.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 6

71. I think that in a -- because of the culture and the environment at the time of the Air Force after Blue Book, it wasn't prudent or good career moves to be talking about any type of phenomenon or UFOs or things like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

72. It just wasn't a good idea for your career.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

73. So when John and I left that for us that night, we were discussing, well, how far do we go with this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

74. And tell them everything?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

75. You know, well, it would be pretty much a career ender, we were thinking that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

76. So we reported in the next day with our shift commander the morning after, and we told him about what happened, and he questioned us on it, and we were somewhat sanitized.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

77. I mean, instead of being up next to a craft, I was at a distance, you know, it was metallic, you know, those kind of things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

78. And he says, "This is just not a good idea to report this."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

79. He says, "I think we should let it go -- you know, just let it go away."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

80. So when I was taken down to OSI, I called on the OSI to make my report, I went in there, and the thoughts of preserving my career were -- they went away, because I was scared to death of the OSI.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

81. They were just threatening me down there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

82. They said, you know, in the way they do it, it's a good cop, bad cop, that kind of thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

83. And I went down there, and they said, "If you write everything that happened, don't leave anything out, this goes away."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

84. Okay, that's exactly what I want to have happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

85. I want this to go away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

86. And so I did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

87. I wrote out four long pages of documents, my statement on the legal paper.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

88. They came back in about 20, 25 minutes, and they have a typed half-page document that is out now on the Internet, and they say it's my statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 7

89. History Channel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

90. The History Channel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 8

91. They're out all over it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

92. It's not my statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

93. In there it says that I got within 50 feet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

94. It says it's a metallic object, and it's very, very, very general.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

95. And the agent says -- and I'm not sure if these are OSI agents, but I was in the OSI building.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

96. Let me clarify that too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

97. I knew all the agents, but I didn't know these people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

98. And they said, "Okay, read this statement."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

99. And I said, "Okay."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

100. And he said, "Read it again."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

101. I said, "Okay."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

102. And they said, "We want you to memorize it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

103. Read it again."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

104. I said, "Okay."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

105. And he said, "This is the official statement that you're going to give your command element or anybody else from this point on that asks about it, because this is a classified investigation, and OSI can operate outside the chain of command.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

106. They do it over in England.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

107. At that time they actually worked for the State Department."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

108. And I said, "Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

109. No problem."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

110. General orders by -- because it's an active investigation by whoever those are -- people in front of me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

111. And so that's why I report to the Wing Commander.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

112. He doesn't even blink an eye when General Williams does it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

113. He said, "Listen --" General Williams is the Wing Commander at that point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

114. General -- Major General Williams, that's what he -- at the time he was Colonel Williams.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

115. You retired a Major General.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

116. And when we reported into Colonel Halt's office, I briefly talked to Colonel Conrad, who was the base commander at the time -- Colonel Halt worked for him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

117. And then John and I met up there, and then we went in and talked to the Wing Commander -- reported into the Wing Commander -- and explained the -- I gave him the OSI statement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

118. I mean, I told him that's what happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

119. It was general, and he thanked us very much for our time and told us that he appreciated the candor that we had.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

120. And he never asked one question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

121. And so there's where the cover-up probably started.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

122. It started by the issuance of that statement from OSI.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

123. You submitted -- Sergeant, you submitted that statement, so it really kind of started as you were writing the statement and submitting it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

124. Well, when I wrote the four pages -- I'll let me make that clear, ma'am -- when I wrote them out, I was in detail.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

125. I wrote down everything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

126. But that wasn't what you submitted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

127. You submitted what they asked you to submit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

128. I gave them everything they wanted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

129. They said write every detail down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

130. Four pages?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

131. Four pages.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

132. And I wrote the fact about the temperature, about it being on the ground, the glyphs, the notes from my notebook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

133. They were included.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

134. I didn't have my notebook there, but all that stuff was included, including the binary code, which I called ones and zeros in because I'm not a math person.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

135. And at that time -- And did you give that to the wing commander?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

136. I gave that to the OSI building.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

137. Did you give that to the wing commander?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

138. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

139. No, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

140. What I gave to the wing commander was the OSI sanitized statement and the one that I was supposed to give them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

141. And why did you not give that one to the wing commander?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

142. Because I was under orders from -- because OSI said it was an ongoing investigation and they can work outside the realm of the base commander, wing commander and everything else like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

143. And my position is, new with this and all that, that might have been the beginning of the cover-up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

144. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

145. I agree.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

146. All right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

147. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

148. And I don't want to badger you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

149. Appreciate your service, trying times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

150. How many years ago was this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

151. This is '80 and this is now '13.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

152. That's 23, 33 years ago, so no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

153. That you're still standing in relatively good health, thank God for that and we'll see what we can do with you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

154. Thank you, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

155. Thank you, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
