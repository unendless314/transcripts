236. Why personally do you think there was an interest in cover up?

## Speaker Group 13

237. Well there's, I think, John alluded to it a little bit earlier, I think part of the problem there was, they were drawn into the area, this object was drawn there because there was interest in the area and the interest has to do with a top secret facility which I later wrote security plans for and stuff at that base which was Marlesham Heath, it was a C3 facility, communications, and it had a building there that at the time had a retinal eye scanner, in 1980 that's like high tech stuff and you don't really waste your money, the government's money on those kind of things over there like that but that was the unusual part of it so there was operations within there and they were civilian by the way, none of those people were wearing uniforms and then just down the street from that another mile and a half or two was MI6, British intelligence that operated out of there and then of course

238. we had the control towers that were strategically placed around the base too that operated radar systems and the communications.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

239. It's also a part, and I think John should talk a little bit about, if you don't mind talking a little bit about Cobra Mist, do you want to talk about that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 14

240. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 15

241. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

242. So this is documented, it's on the internet, before our incident there was a project called Cobra Mist, I don't know if any of you are aware of it but it was over the horizon radar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

243. The Russians had their project called Woodpecker and there was activity going on between both sides trying to counteract this particular technology.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

244. What's interesting is and it's posted right in the, why it was shut down was when they posted Cobra Mist on the coast and by the way the NSA had a facility there with Cobra Mist was the fact that it didn't work properly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

245. They brought in the Stanford Research Institute to find out why it didn't work properly, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

246. What they determined was that there was something coming from inside the country that was keeping it from working properly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

247. They had spent a lot of money on this project and they just shut it down almost immediately after that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

248. But the thing was the people that work on Cobra Mist, civilians and military, and the Stanford Research Institute never left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

249. They were moved on to Bentwaters, Woodbridge, and at Marlesham Heath.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

250. So what appears to happen was whatever they were working on at the time, they came to realize something else was going on in the area, and they continued to work forward with whatever project they were working on at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

251. There obviously had to be a lot of discussion about what had happened there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

252. There are three fairly obvious possibilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

253. One was it was an experimental something we were doing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

254. It was something the Soviets were doing or it was extraterrestrial.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

255. Which of those was the general consensus?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

256. For the rest of the base?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

257. Sir?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

258. You mean for what the rest of the base?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

259. Well, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

260. There had to be a lot of discussion as to what went on out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

261. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

262. Things were shut down?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

263. The discussion was limited.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

264. Anybody that was in the know was told it was classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

265. You don't talk about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

266. Anybody that wasn't in the know talked about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

267. How quickly were you told that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

268. That was the morning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

269. It started almost immediately with the shift commander continued on with the fact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

270. Also one other note that we confirmed through the controller who was in charge of writing up the reports that day, all the documents were immediately classified secret.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

271. What's interesting is CNN, Chuck DeCaro, special assignments reporter, attempted to do a report on the incident, and when he asked for the incident reports, the 1569s and the blot entries on this, do you want to know what his answer was given to him?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

272. They disappeared.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

273. They're lost.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

274. Somebody took them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

275. We don't know where they are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

276. Did they give you an indication why they were classifying it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

277. Let me give you one last question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

278. Any indication why they were classifying it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

279. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

280. At the time, you've got to remember 1980 we were young airmen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

281. Today, yeah, we have a general idea why it was probably classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

282. Well it's because they wanted to cover it up as a general consensus.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

283. At that time, they had to have some explanation why you classify it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

284. Security?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

285. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

286. We were not in the need to know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

287. We didn't have the clearance level or the authority to ask why.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

288. We were told to shut up and color.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

289. Some of the other evidence that was taken, I would assume would be taken by General Gabriel, because in the Wing Command Post, it's a hardened shelter on Bentwaters, our control center for up-channeling, helping hands cover wagons, these are code words for security reports, down-channel reports, you know, DEFCON 3s, those kind of things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

290. They have a, at the time, a reel-to-reel, and they would record all of the radio transmissions on our four channels, I believe we had four, a command net and I think an LA net and a couple others, and they would record all that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

291. Those things, like that, that's a smoking gun.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

292. That actually had our radio transmissions and what was transpiring over the net.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

293. Those were taken.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. The 1569, which is a complaint and incident report, which is once you make a blotter entry, it's a more detailed report that you write out from your notes, and that would go on record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. But we were told by the senior controller, and that was Sergeant Coffey, that those were immediately pulled from CSC, Central Security Control, and classified secret.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. So that was another step toward the containment efforts to have it quieted down and in some more misdirection.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. I'm still holding off on the cover-up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. I really am biting at the bit on that one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. You've done that pretty well, but you just mentioned another opportunity to discuss something, and I didn't write it down, so I'm kind of, what else did I, I said I was going to yield back to you to ask, you ask, are we going to talk about cover-up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. Well, it's here to see, when we're told everything's classified, and anybody else that was involved is classified, don't talk about it, and we take that seriously, and it'll protect our country's interests.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. Then they decided to make cover stories, and the brilliance of the United States Air Force and cover stories, I love it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. They said that it was alien.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. They said it was E.T. related.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. They said they had floating stuff, and all this other stuff was said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. It was a UFO, and with little green men, basically.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. That's what they said it was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. So- Was it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. Absolutely not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. It was a craft of unknown origin.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. I wasn't able to determine the origin of the craft.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. When it comes down to investigations, ma'am, we take our job seriously.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. We only report the facts as we see them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. There's no conjecture.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. We have other people that can look at those things, assess the situation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. My main issue I had that night, I knew it was an aircraft crash, I just said that because we lost contact with a bogey about 15 minutes prior to them reporting it and getting me to the gate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. I was thinking it was more of a security situation out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. We had around 160, I believe it was six squadrons of A-10 tank killers there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. We had 10,000 people working on that base live there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. We had munitions storage, sensitive weapon systems.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. We had C-3 facilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. We had part of the Cobra Mist team that we can't go in those areas.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. We had other mission requirements that still remain classified today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. My job was to ascertain if it was a threat to the security, the war-making capability of that base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. That was what I was doing out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. Everything we put in a report, it's all facts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. You don't elude to, even though I must admit, I knew this thing wasn't like in the Jane's book of known aircraft, I said it had to be some kind of technology that was beyond what we could produce at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. I mean, yeah, those thoughts went through my mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. But do I report it as such?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. I stuck to the facts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. The fact that you saw something not normal in your training and your experience, and you wrote that in a three or four page memo, what you saw and what you experienced.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. I wrote that in my statement, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. Yes, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. What you gave to the wing commander was something less than that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. I felt really guilty about that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. About giving the other one or writing the first one?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. Well, there's a loyalty thing going on here, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. I mean, I'm under orders, but that's my wing commander.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. That's my base commander.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. I have an obligation always to protect them and to follow their orders and not tell them anything that's not true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. And here I have orders at the OSI building saying, "You're going to go ahead and give this statement to your command element or anybody else ask about it."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. I lived with that for about 31 years, and I had the opportunity to talk to Major General Williams, Gordon Williams, and that was one of the things I brought up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. And he says, "Don't worry about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. Following orders."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. He says, "I know how it was.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. I know what happened.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. I understand you weren't treated it fairly."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. He says, "I'm here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. What do you need from me?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. Let's hold that one right there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. Your point's well taken, and the more you talk, the more it is coming out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. We've heard several incidences.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. Roswell has nothing on this that we hear, and we're going to hear Roswell tomorrow.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. Very cousins probably.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. I mean, the incidents, sisters, brothers, or whatever.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. But I feel your passion and your pain, and 30 years plus is a long time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. And now to be in a situation where you can't get health care because of your -- it's way bigger than the two of you, and I know you know that by now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. But let us continue to get the information we need to make intelligent decisions.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. But we're here to work.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. You're not just going to see us just for the day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. Take our names.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. We'll help and work with you as well, but we're going to get it back to that congress that you work for.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. Who works for you, I should say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
