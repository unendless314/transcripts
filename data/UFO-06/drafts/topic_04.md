## Speaker Group 13

237. Well there's, I think, John alluded to it a little bit earlier, I think part of the problem there was, they were drawn into the area, this object was drawn there because there was interest in the area and the interest has to do with a top secret facility which I later wrote security plans for and stuff at that base which was Marlesham Heath, it was a C3 facility, communications, and it had a building there that at the time had a retinal eye scanner, in 1980 that's like high tech stuff and you don't really waste your money, the government's money on those kind of things over there like that but that was the unusual part of it so there was operations within there and they were civilian by the way, none of those people were wearing uniforms and then just down the street from that another mile and a half or two was MI6, British intelligence that operated out of there and then of course
→ {"text": "嗯，我想 John 稍早有提到一點，我認為部分問題在於，它們被吸引到這個區域，這個物體被吸引到那裡是因為該區域有值得關注的設施，而這個關注點與一個最高機密設施有關，我後來為該基地的這個設施撰寫過安全計畫，那就是馬勒沙姆希斯（Marlesham Heath），它是一個 C3 設施，指揮、控制與通訊設施，那裡有一棟建築物在當時配備了視網膜掃描器，在 1980 年那可是高科技設備，政府不會在那種地方浪費錢在這類東西上，但那正是不尋常之處，所以那裡有一些行動在進行，而且順帶一提，他們都是平民，那些人都沒穿制服，然後就在那條街下去大約一英里半到兩英里的地方是軍情六處（MI6），英國情報機構在那裡運作，然後當然", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文Marvisham Heath為轉錄錯誤，已修正為Marlesham Heath；terminology.yaml：C3 facility→C3設施，retinal eye scanner→視網膜掃描器，MI6→軍情六處，top secret→最高機密"}

238. we had the control towers that were strategically placed around the base too that operated radar systems and the communications.
→ {"text": "我們還有策略性地分布在基地周圍的管制塔，負責運作雷達系統和通訊系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. It's also a part, and I think John should talk a little bit about, if you don't mind talking a little bit about Cobra Mist, do you want to talk about that?
→ {"text": "這也是其中一部分，我想 John 應該談談，如果你不介意談談眼鏡蛇迷霧計畫（Cobra Mist），你想談這個嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Cobra Mist根據terminology.yaml翻譯為「眼鏡蛇迷霧計畫」"}

242. So this is documented, it's on the internet, before our incident there was a project called Cobra Mist, I don't know if any of you are aware of it but it was over the horizon radar.
→ {"text": "這是有文件記錄的，可以在網路上找到，在我們的事件之前有一個專案叫做眼鏡蛇迷霧計畫（Cobra Mist），我不知道你們是否有人知道這個，但它是一個超視距雷達系統。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "over the horizon radar根據terminology.yaml中的定義翻譯為「超視距雷達系統」"}

243. The Russians had their project called Woodpecker and there was activity going on between both sides trying to counteract this particular technology.
→ {"text": "俄羅斯人有他們的計畫叫做啄木鳥計畫（Woodpecker），雙方之間有一些活動試圖對抗這項特定技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Woodpecker根據terminology.yaml翻譯為「啄木鳥計畫」"}

244. What's interesting is and it's posted right in the, why it was shut down was when they posted Cobra Mist on the coast and by the way the NSA had a facility there with Cobra Mist was the fact that it didn't work properly.
→ {"text": "有趣的是，而且這就直接公布在，它為何被關閉的原因是當他們在海岸部署眼鏡蛇迷霧計畫時，順便說一下國家安全局（NSA）在那裡與眼鏡蛇迷霧計畫有一個設施，事實是它無法正常運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "NSA根據terminology.yaml翻譯為「國家安全局」"}

245. They brought in the Stanford Research Institute to find out why it didn't work properly, okay.
→ {"text": "他們引入史丹佛研究院（Stanford Research Institute）來找出它為何無法正常運作，好嗎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Stanford Research Institute根據terminology.yaml翻譯為「史丹佛研究院」"}

246. What they determined was that there was something coming from inside the country that was keeping it from working properly.
→ {"text": "他們確定的結論是有某種來自國內的東西阻止它正常運作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. They had spent a lot of money on this project and they just shut it down almost immediately after that.
→ {"text": "他們在這個專案上花了很多錢，但幾乎立即就將它關閉了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. But the thing was the people that work on Cobra Mist, civilians and military, and the Stanford Research Institute never left.
→ {"text": "但問題是那些在眼鏡蛇迷霧計畫工作的人，平民和軍人，還有史丹佛研究院的人從未離開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. They were moved on to Bentwaters, Woodbridge, and at Marlesham Heath.
→ {"text": "他們被轉移到本特沃特斯（Bentwaters）、伍德布里奇（Woodbridge）和馬勒沙姆希斯（Marlesham Heath）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文有轉錄錯誤，已修正為正確的基地名稱"}

250. So what appears to happen was whatever they were working on at the time, they came to realize something else was going on in the area, and they continued to work forward with whatever project they were working on at the time.
→ {"text": "所以看起來發生的情況是，無論他們當時在進行什麼工作，他們開始意識到該區域正在發生其他事情，然後他們繼續推進當時正在進行的任何專案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "有趣的是，CNN 的查克·狄卡羅（Chuck DeCaro），特別任務記者，試圖對這起事件進行報導，當他要求取得事件報告、1569 表格和這方面的記錄簿登記時，你想知道他得到什麼答覆嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Chuck DeCaro根據terminology.yaml翻譯為「查克·狄卡羅」"}

289. Some of the other evidence that was taken, I would assume would be taken by General Gabriel, because in the Wing Command Post, it's a hardened shelter on Bentwaters, our control center for up-channeling, helping hands cover wagons, these are code words for security reports, down-channel reports, you know, DEFCON 3s, those kind of things.
→ {"text": "其他一些被拿走的證據，我猜測應該是被加百列將軍（General Gabriel）拿走的，因為在聯隊指揮所，那是本特沃特斯（Bentwaters）的一個加固掩體，是我們向上呈報的控制中心，helping hands、cover wagons，這些是安全報告的代號，向下傳達的報告，你知道，DEFCON 3 之類的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文Bantwaters為轉錄錯誤，已修正為Bentwaters；General Gabriel根據terminology.yaml翻譯為「加百列將軍」"}

293. Those were taken.
