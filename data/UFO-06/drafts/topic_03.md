## Speaker Group 8

156. Mr. Burroughs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

157. Yes, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

158. What stands out to me is the fact that you had an incident take place over three nights at the largest attack fighter wing in the Air Force at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

159. You had over three flights involved and probably well over 150 personnel that were aware of something going on, whether they were listening to it on the radio, whether they were observing something from their location or were actually up close and personal with whatever was out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

160. How many times has something come back three nights in a row?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

161. I've seen very little evidence involving the UFO community where something comes back more than once.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

162. We had the distinct pleasure of having something visit us three times.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

163. As you said, a cover-up began immediately.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

164. It drew the attention of somebody because a C-5 came in on Sunday night.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

165. What was reported was a team from Langley Air Force Base that had their own helicopters, their own vehicles and their own security.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

166. They cordoned the force off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

167. I was posted on the gate on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and my orders were, because I was already involved in the incident, that you'd be aware that some strange things could possibly be going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

168. If I saw anything happen, it was my job to not report it on the radio but to call it in on the phone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

169. Don't get alarmed by anything that could be going on, but if there's something of extreme importance, call it in on the phone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

170. So we had a team out there investigating what we were involved with.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

171. What's also interesting to me is the fact that it was off base and that wasn't our property that the United States Air Force was given the lead on this investigation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

172. Why is that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

173. What did they already know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

174. Was there something that keyed them into whatever we were involved with?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

175. Why would they send a team in from Langley to investigate this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

176. From there, after the investigation was concluded with the team and they departed, there was all kinds of rumors of what was going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

177. What Sergeant Penniston and I did, what we were told to do, is to remain quiet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

178. But over the years, different personnel have come forward and been interviewed about what took place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

179. Different things have come up as far as what was seen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

180. What's clear, and I'm not going to hold anything back on this, almost everybody involved saw something different.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

181. They reported something different.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

182. They reported different things that they felt and what went on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

183. There was static electricity in the air.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

184. There was problems with equipment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

185. And yet, after all this went on, none of us were ever brought in and officially debriefed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

186. None of us were ever taken care of or checked out medically.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

187. But none of us were relieved of duty.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

188. And just recently in the past two years, the deputy base commander at the time, who then was promoted to colonel, ended up being base commander at that and other locations, came out and went on the record and said what he saw out there, he felt, was of intelligence, was under intelligence control.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

189. One of the questions that's come up to me over the years is was it us?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

190. Was it somewhere else or could it be both?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

191. I believe what we were looking at out there on those three nights was something that was going on both with us and whatever we were doing drew something in that created a reaction.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

192. And I believe this case could be the defining case in the history of UFOs that might be able to break this open if there's people that are willing to take charge of this in a position of power and look into this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

193. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

194. Very well spoken.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

195. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

196. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

197. Congressman Bartlett, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

198. There had to be an official investigation of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

199. Do we have any idea where the records of this are?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

200. My best assessment, sir, is that the start point was General Gabriel, commander in chief United States Air Force in Europe, but whether his staff after his visit conducted the investigation or whether his staff then handed off the investigation to somebody else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

201. I don't know that, sir, but at least having the start point, it should enable Freedom of Information Act requests to say if you don't have those records, who does?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

202. Is it my understanding that when he left, he took with him some of the documentation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

203. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

204. It was the custom and practice of the deputy base commander, Charles Holt, to take with him a handheld cassette recorder on which he documented his thoughts and observations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

205. It's that tape recording, which is now in the public domain, that is referred to in the document has been taken back to Ramstein.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

206. What the document does not say and itemize is what else he took back, but we know for example from testimony of others involved that there were things such as soil samples that went somewhere, samples I believe from the damaged trees that were facing this craft, and indeed whatever documentation the general may have taken with him.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

207. You were there when the craft took off, sergeants?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

208. There was no sound or was there sound?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

209. When the craft generated, it did generate more lighting and that concerned me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

210. I wasn't sure it was going to explode or I wasn't really sure about that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

211. So I did take a somewhat defensive position and it rose off the ground.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

212. With that, it went up to tree level and momentary hovered and then took off in the blink of an eye.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

213. The things that it didn't do was stuff that it should have done, at least that's what I was hoping at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

214. I was hoping for air displacement, all aircraft do that from the engines.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

215. I was hoping for aircraft sound, all aircraft do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

216. I was hoping for those type of things that would occur.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

217. One of the things that stopped after it reached a certain point was the static, the feeling of clothing in that, that did stop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

218. It did it with silence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

219. I also made an observation that I figured it was intelligence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

220. I mean, I'm not saying it's manned, it's too small for that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

221. What I'm saying that when a craft will momentarily hover or an object and if it turns to the right, that tells me it's intelligent, controlling it of some kind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

222. A drone doesn't just sit there and go, why bother, it would take off and then go make the flight plan or whatever it wanted to do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

223. So that was odd.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

224. And to this day, I have not seen any technology that would even come close to replicating the technology that I observed that night.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

225. As a matter of fact, if the United States had that kind of technology, you could probably cut your defense budget in half and not have to worry about a thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

226. That would be the key of Pax Americana or whatever, peace under American control.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

227. But yeah, that's, are we going to go back to the cover-up part of it or, I really have some issues with the cover-up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 9

228. You know, this is your time, Sergeant, we're here, we invited you to come to testify and the members are trying to gain information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

229. I'm going to let him finish and then I'm going to get back to you, okay?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

230. Relative to the cover-up, it obviously started pretty quickly because you were told to sign an abbreviated sanitized statement that put you far enough away from the craft that it could be interpreted as hallucination or reflections or something like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

231. Other than the exchange you had when that sanitized abbreviated statement was prepared, were you ever interrogated as to the details of what you saw?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

232. That's interesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

233. The first, the only time I remember, consciously remember being interviewed, that's a nice way to put it, by, at the OSI building was on, I believe it was the Monday, Monday after the incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

234. The incident happened on a weekend and I believe it was Monday or Tuesday when I was called in there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

235. So that, and that's right now my statement and all that, but under hypnosis in 1994, it's apparently around February 1st of that year it was noted in the hypnosis that I was taken back into the OSI building or it could have been the Wing Intel, I'm not sure, and also interrogated at that point again and that one was where I was administered sodium pentothal which is a very graphic thing to watch on film and additional questions were asked and additional discoveries were made.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
