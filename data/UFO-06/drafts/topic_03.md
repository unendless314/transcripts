→ {"text": "涉及超過三個飛行中隊，可能有超過 150 名人員意識到有事情正在發生，無論他們是透過無線電收聽、從自己的位置觀察到某些東西，還是實際近距離接觸到那裡的任何事物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "flights 在軍事語境中指飛行中隊"}

163. As you said, a cover-up began immediately.
→ {"text": "如您所說，真相掩蓋立即開始了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "cover-up 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「真相掩蓋」"}

→ {"text": "所以我們有一個小組在那裡調查我們所涉入的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

171. What's also interesting to me is the fact that it was off base and that wasn't our property that the United States Air Force was given the lead on this investigation.
→ {"text": "同樣令我感興趣的是，事件發生在基地外，那不是我們的財產，但美國空軍卻被賦予了這次調查的主導權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

188. And just recently in the past two years, the deputy base commander at the time, who then was promoted to colonel, ended up being base commander at that and other locations, came out and went on the record and said what he saw out there, he felt, was of intelligence, was under intelligence control.
→ {"text": "就在最近兩年，當時的副基地指揮官，後來晉升為上校，最終成為該基地和其他地點的基地指揮官，他挺身而出公開表態，說他在那裡看到的東西，他認為具有智慧，是在智慧控制之下的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "deputy base commander 指 Colonel Halt"}

189. One of the questions that's come up to me over the years is was it us?

190. Was it somewhere else or could it be both?
→ {"text": "還是來自其他地方，或者可能兩者皆是？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我相信我們在那三個晚上所看到的，是與我們的活動有關的某種事物，而無論我們在做什麼，都吸引了某種東西進來，並引發了反應。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我相信這個案件可能成為不明飛行物歷史上的關鍵案例，如果有身居要職的人願意負責並深入調查此事，或許能夠揭開真相。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "UFO 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「不明飛行物」"}

199. Do we have any idea where the records of this are?
→ {"text": "我們知道這些記錄在哪裡嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

200. My best assessment, sir, is that the start point was General Gabriel, commander in chief United States Air Force in Europe, but whether his staff after his visit conducted the investigation or whether his staff then handed off the investigation to somebody else.
→ {"text": "先生，我最好的評估是，起點是 Gabriel 將軍，美國駐歐空軍總司令，但在他訪問之後，是他的幕僚進行了調查，還是他的幕僚將調查移交給其他人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "General Gabriel 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「加百列將軍」，commander in chief United States Air Force in Europe 翻譯為「美國駐歐空軍總司令」"}

201. I don't know that, sir, but at least having the start point, it should enable Freedom of Information Act requests to say if you don't have those records, who does?
→ {"text": "先生，我不知道這個，但至少有了起點，應該能透過資訊自由法申請來詢問，如果你們沒有這些記錄，那誰有？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Freedom of Information Act 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「資訊自由法」"}

202. Is it my understanding that when he left, he took with him some of the documentation?

203. Yes, sir.

204. It was the custom and practice of the deputy base commander, Charles Holt, to take with him a handheld cassette recorder on which he documented his thoughts and observations.
→ {"text": "副基地指揮官 Charles Halt 的習慣做法是隨身攜帶一台手持卡式錄音機，用來記錄他的想法和觀察。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Charles Holt 即 Colonel Halt"}

206. What the document does not say and itemize is what else he took back, but we know for example from testimony of others involved that there were things such as soil samples that went somewhere, samples I believe from the damaged trees that were facing this craft, and indeed whatever documentation the general may have taken with him.
→ {"text": "文件中沒有說明和列出他還帶回了什麼，但我們從其他涉入者的證詞中得知，有些東西被帶到某處，例如土壤樣本，我相信還有來自面對這個飛行器的受損樹木的樣本，以及將軍可能隨身帶走的任何文件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

207. You were there when the craft took off, sergeants?
→ {"text": "中士，您在飛行器起飛時在場嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. There was no sound or was there sound?
→ {"text": "有聲音還是沒有聲音？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

209. When the craft generated, it did generate more lighting and that concerned me.
→ {"text": "當飛行器啟動時，它確實產生了更多的光，這讓我感到擔憂。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

210. I wasn't sure it was going to explode or I wasn't really sure about that.
→ {"text": "我不確定它是否會爆炸，或者我真的不確定那會發生什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

211. So I did take a somewhat defensive position and it rose off the ground.
→ {"text": "所以我確實採取了某種防禦姿勢，然後它從地面升起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. With that, it went up to tree level and momentary hovered and then took off in the blink of an eye.
→ {"text": "接著，它升到樹的高度，短暫懸停，然後在眨眼之間就飛走了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

213. The things that it didn't do was stuff that it should have done, at least that's what I was hoping at the time.
→ {"text": "它沒有做的事情，是它應該做的事情，至少我當時是這麼希望的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

214. I was hoping for air displacement, all aircraft do that from the engines.
→ {"text": "我希望看到空氣位移，所有飛行器的引擎都會產生這種現象。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

215. I was hoping for aircraft sound, all aircraft do that.
→ {"text": "我希望聽到飛行器的聲音，所有飛行器都會發出聲音。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

216. I was hoping for those type of things that would occur.
→ {"text": "我希望看到這些類型的事情發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

217. One of the things that stopped after it reached a certain point was the static, the feeling of clothing in that, that did stop.
→ {"text": "在它達到某個點之後停止的事情之一是靜電，那種衣服上的感覺，確實停止了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "指靜電讓衣服產生的感覺"}

218. It did it with silence.
→ {"text": "它是在完全無聲的情況下做到這一切的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

219. I also made an observation that I figured it was intelligence.
→ {"text": "我還做了一個觀察，我認為它具有智慧。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

220. I mean, I'm not saying it's manned, it's too small for that.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，我不是說它有人駕駛，它太小了不可能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. What I'm saying that when a craft will momentarily hover or an object and if it turns to the right, that tells me it's intelligent, controlling it of some kind.
→ {"text": "我要說的是，當一個飛行器或物體短暫懸停，然後向右轉，這告訴我它具有智慧，受到某種控制。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. A drone doesn't just sit there and go, why bother, it would take off and then go make the flight plan or whatever it wanted to do.
→ {"text": "無人機不會只是停在那裡，何必呢，它會起飛然後執行飛行計畫或它想做的任何事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. So that was odd.
→ {"text": "所以那很奇怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. And to this day, I have not seen any technology that would even come close to replicating the technology that I observed that night.
→ {"text": "直到今天，我還沒有看到任何技術能夠接近複製我那晚觀察到的技術。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. As a matter of fact, if the United States had that kind of technology, you could probably cut your defense budget in half and not have to worry about a thing.
→ {"text": "事實上，如果美國擁有那種技術，你們大概可以把國防預算削減一半，而且不必擔心任何事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. That would be the key of Pax Americana or whatever, peace under American control.
→ {"text": "那將是美國治下和平的關鍵，或者隨便怎麼說，美國控制下的和平。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Pax Americana 是拉丁文，意為「美國治下和平」"}

227. But yeah, that's, are we going to go back to the cover-up part of it or, I really have some issues with the cover-up.
→ {"text": "但是，那個，我們要回到真相掩蓋的部分嗎，我對真相掩蓋確實有些問題要說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "cover-up 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「真相掩蓋」"}


## Speaker Group 9

228. You know, this is your time, Sergeant, we're here, we invited you to come to testify and the members are trying to gain information.
→ {"text": "你知道，中士，這是您的時間，我們在這裡，我們邀請您來作證，委員們正試圖獲取資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. I'm going to let him finish and then I'm going to get back to you, okay?
→ {"text": "我要讓他說完，然後我會回到您這邊，好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 10

230. Relative to the cover-up, it obviously started pretty quickly because you were told to sign an abbreviated sanitized statement that put you far enough away from the craft that it could be interpreted as hallucination or reflections or something like that.
→ {"text": "關於真相掩蓋，它顯然很快就開始了，因為您被要求簽署一份簡短的刪減陳述，讓您與飛行器保持足夠的距離，以便可以被解釋為幻覺或反射之類的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "cover-up 翻譯為「真相掩蓋」，sanitized 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「刪減的」"}

231. Other than the exchange you had when that sanitized abbreviated statement was prepared, were you ever interrogated as to the details of what you saw?
→ {"text": "除了準備那份刪減的簡短陳述時的交流之外，您是否曾被訊問過關於您所看到的細節？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 11

232. That's interesting.
→ {"text": "這很有趣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. The first, the only time I remember, consciously remember being interviewed, that's a nice way to put it, by, at the OSI building was on, I believe it was the Monday, Monday after the incident.
→ {"text": "第一次，也是我唯一記得的，有意識地記得被訪談，這是一種委婉的說法，在特別調查處的建築裡，我相信是在事件發生後的那個週一。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "OSI 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「特別調查處」"}

234. The incident happened on a weekend and I believe it was Monday or Tuesday when I was called in there.
→ {"text": "事件發生在週末，我相信是週一或週二我被叫到那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. So that, and that's right now my statement and all that, but under hypnosis in 1994, it's apparently around February 1st of that year it was noted in the hypnosis that I was taken back into the OSI building or it could have been the Wing Intel, I'm not sure, and also interrogated at that point again and that one was where I was administered sodium pentothal which is a very graphic thing to watch on film and additional questions were asked and additional discoveries were made.
→ {"text": "所以那個，那就是我現在的陳述等等，但在 1994 年的催眠中，顯然是在那年的 2 月 1 日左右，催眠中記錄到我被帶回特別調查處的建築，或者可能是聯隊情報處，我不確定，並在那時再次被訊問，而那次就是我被施用硫噴妥鈉的時候，這在影片中看起來非常生動，還被問了更多問題，並有了更多發現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "sodium pentothal 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「硫噴妥鈉」，Wing Intel 指聯隊情報處"}
