## Speaker Group 15

542. Congresswoman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. Thank you, Madam Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

545. Very quickly, how many people...I mean, when I first heard you speak about this object that lit up the sky and that you observed and touched, how many people knew about that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

546. I mean, was that reported in the press?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. I mean, you're near a base, was there a lot of members at your base that knew about this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. There was quite a few people at the base that knew about it, the people that had the need to know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. There's other people that have seen stuff in the sky.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. I mean, there had to be some...if it came from the sky, somebody had to see it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

552. There's a civilian, and he's been on the record.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. His name is Jerry Harris.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

554. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

555. He lived just off base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

556. And you know, of course, I got to talk to him a number of years later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

557. And he says, "Well, you know, I noticed stuff was going on."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

558. He says, "I seen, you know, this light over the...canopy of light over the forest."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

559. He says, "Then I see all this activity."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. I think they were talking about the third night with John, I'm not sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

561. And he says, "It was all unusual stuff," he says.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

562. So there was concern.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

563. And then he also worked...I guess he had a car shop, he worked on automotive stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

564. And people from the base used that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

565. And of course, the Scuttlebutt, which was running amok, about some kind of UFO, and that was actually the cover story, has been seen, and they just started to put more of those stories out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

566. And I think that's what deflated the situation with the civilian population, because we were close with our British neighbors, or I mean, that they would not...you know, they heard things like, "We visited pubs, we went to the local economy, we did all that stuff."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

567. So there was chatter going on, I'm sure, and you know, unfortunately, what the chatter they were hearing was not true.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. It was a cover.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. And one of the interesting part about it, and it came out in Sky, whatever book that was, Sky something, Skycrash, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

570. There was three British investigators that was investigating it, initially in '83.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

571. And one of the things they talk about, and first of all, is what happened, and it's the cover story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

572. They don't even know they're talking about the cover story, it's hilarious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

573. But we did, it was good containment, I mean, it was working well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

574. Then in '83, the news of the world, I had a disgruntled airman, apparently, talk to him, and they put that story out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

575. And that was the cover story, I mean, it wasn't the right story, so it worked, it worked well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

576. And then the other thing is, I got asked downtown about, "Hey, tell us about that situation out the base."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

577. What situation out the base?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

578. Now, you know, I'm really good at evasive stuff, I said, "What, the PLL trucks, or what, or the plane that came in, or what are you talking about?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

579. "No, no, no, no, about that, your wing commander talking to the UFO people, that's the stuff they would say, I mean, it's all cover."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

580. So we had that kind of chatter, and after a while, you know, it's just, it's a laughable situation for people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. But you were, were you the only two that actually saw it and touched it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

582. No, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

583. That was, well, we had the full security flight working that night, and we had the full law enforcement.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

584. And the difference between security and law enforcement, security protects the priority A, B, and C resources of the base, the operational, war-making stuff.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

585. Law enforcement, well, they're like the police for the base, you know, they do domestics and things like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

586. And there were 60, approximately about 60 of them, it could have been 80 on some nights, we were transitioning earlier from the F-4s there to the A-10s, so there was still some overages in people, so.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

587. But totally, on both the two nights, I would say it's more like 160 people, trained observers, security force members.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

588. They didn't all keep quiet about this, surely?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

589. The ones that were directly involved, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

591. Those are the, that's how it works, ma'am, orders, and you follow orders, I mean, there was ongoing investigation, it was classified.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

592. You can't talk, oh, we don't have the privilege of Congress, we, we can't talk about things like that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

593. It's criminal activity.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

594. They don't use the privilege.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. Sometimes they don't use the privilege, you're right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

596. So how many other people, are there any other people in your situation that were there, I mean, that may have touched it, or?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

597. There are, not touching it, like I said, I got the distinct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

598. Or being close by, or?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

599. Close by, I mean, you're talking within 100 to 200 feet, that was the East Gate area, we had a restricted area that was down there that housed A-10s, they were parked in hardened structures down there, and we had security response teams that were patrolling those areas, alarm response teams, entry controllers, we had those kind of people that were working, and what happened is the control center put a order across the net saying everybody just stop transmissions and let us talk and do what we were doing out there, that was the security situation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

600. And everybody got to listen, everybody unfortunately probably watched, I mean, they should be doing their job.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

601. At that time you should heighten your security a little bit more, you know, if there's something going off the base, don't, you know, start collecting in an area, but those are some mistakes that were probably made, some vulnerabilities that we did that probably shouldn't be known either, but they happened and it was 30 something years ago, it doesn't matter now, yeah, there's probably some things that were not correctly done, but it was out of curiosity, people were doing that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

602. Right, I mean, why wouldn't you be curious about what had happened?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

603. So is there anybody else that's in the same situation you are, would any of these people that sort of knew about it because they were close by, would they cover up, would they be part of the cover-up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

604. What are you doing?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

605. Can I ask you?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

606. Yeah, go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

607. Okay, ma'am, what's interesting is the fact that of the three nights, only five statements have surfaced from what went on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

608. The first night there were three of us in one out there, the second night you had the shift commander and the on-duty flight chief, on the third night Colonel Hall took a team out there and there was also other personnel in the woods and different people saw different things, so that's one of the reasons why we come forward besides our health issues is I feel it's necessary that anyone that was even out in that area should have the opportunity to be checked out medically and be told what they were exposed to, especially something that's over 30 years old.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

609. That's one of the questions he asked me first up, he goes, what the heck was going on out there that would draw this much attention from the agencies involved to this day?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

610. What would still be classified and if it is, what did we have or what were we dealing with that would still remain silent today?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

611. Almost every weapon we've ever developed back in that time frame has been exposed that we're aware of and yet today this is still classified and we can't even receive medical treatment for it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

612. Should we tell them about what happened with OSI?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

613. Oh, yes, one other thing that happened that when we sent our FOIA request, OSI blew their time limit and after we made certain announcements, yes, they blew it by ear, but our attorney can go into detail the contact we had in a make-up form they asked us to sign implying that we could be perjuring ourselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

614. So they're trying to throw intimidation 32 years later?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

615. They're trying to intimidate you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

616. Are you kidding me?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

617. I mean, you think we-- I can see that you've been intimidated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

618. Yeah, we're intimidated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

619. We laughed about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

620. Is that the best they got?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

621. Is that the best they can do after 32 years, is try the intimidation-- it had a made-up form, ma'am.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

622. I mean, come on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

623. You think we're idiots?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

624. You know, that was a made-up form and then you had contact, too, also our attorney, which shook him up a little bit, I think, because he wasn't-- were you okay with that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

625. I've had the NSA call me on my cell phone just to see how I was doing and so, now, remember I used the word "weird" earlier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

626. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

627. This is another example of, you know-- So why the interest 32 years later if nothing happened?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

628. And why did they blow what's under the law, the FOIA requests?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

629. They refused to answer our second-- what we submitted, which was a little different than the first time, but the excuse they used was they'd already answered the first FOIA request, so they're not going to answer the second FOIA request.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

630. What are they hiding until this day?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

631. You know, those dogs don't hunt.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

632. They don't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

633. They're telling us stuff like they think we're airmen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

634. I mean, like, just two years, five years in, oh, no, no, we're grown men.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

635. That stuff, I think, is not going to work with us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

636. And you think we're going to-- I'll make the record clear, we're not going to sit back and take anything from the United States government right now at this point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

637. I mean, we're here to go ahead and clear this up the best we can and to get answers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

638. This is a step in the process, and this is not over.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

639. This is not over for John and I.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

640. I mean, we're going to continue to do that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

641. Once we achieve what we want to achieve, we're going to go off radar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

642. You'll never hear from us again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

643. Never hear from us again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

644. We'll be off radar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

645. And that's what we want to have happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

646. That's all we ever wanted to have happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

647. We wanted it to go away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

648. You want those questions answered, which you deserve.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

649. Yes, and I think if the-- if we didn't have the caveats-- Excuse me, just one moment for the record, will you-- Congresswoman, two more minutes, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

650. If we didn't have the caveats that were laid on our command structure at the time, and also the classified documents that-- and programs that were going on, which have been classified now, we will talk about them later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

651. I don't think that-- I think here's-- let me go and change my thought on this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

652. If you look at the-- take a look at the Bentwaters incident, the Reynolds and Forest incident, not as a UFO incident, but as an incident that is going to cause, apparently, the DLD and other federal agencies grief if any of that information got out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

653. Why is there so much grief involved for them?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

654. Why is there something so classified that it can't get out?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

655. Well, I think it's because-- and I'm going to go ahead and say this is my thoughts on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

656. I think it's because of the lies that have been done for the last 85 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

657. I think they don't want the real truth to come out, not because they-- American people can't handle it, because they don't want to get caught with their pants down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

658. That's the problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

659. They've been lying about UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

660. That's what's going on here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

661. If you ask a question to the United States government, anybody, you say, "Tell me what you know about UFOs."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

662. Well, you know what, that's not the right question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

663. What you've got to do is you've got to ask the right questions to whatever agency you're asking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

664. You've got to be very specific of what you're asking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

665. You know what I'm saying.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

666. "Tell me about UFOs."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

667. Oh, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

668. UFOs don't exist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

669. UFOs, that's UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

670. They don't-- they don't give you any answers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 16

671. I yield a half a minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 17

672. Oh, sorry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

673. Let me help you on that one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

674. Sure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

675. When the issue is brought before the White House, the White House says there's nothing out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

676. You know, nothing's gone on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

677. Nothing's being covered up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

678. So in order to back up the White House, the whole chain of command within the government continues this mockery of not telling the truth, because this is the position of the White House.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

679. If the White House came out and said, "Oh, there is," then all bets would be off.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

680. So it starts there, and it ends down at you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

681. I think it's bigger than that, though.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

682. I think it's-- I think presidents come and go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

683. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

684. Okay?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

685. Yes, they do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

686. I think you folks come and go.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

687. I don't think-- I don't think these secrets are general knowledge to you folks, or what-- or to presidents, okay?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

688. That's my thoughts on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

689. An interesting conversation I'll share with you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

690. We were coming back from a Larry King show in 2007, and Governor Symington was in there, and he was, I guess, friends with President Clinton, or still is, or some kind of situation with their friends.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

691. So we got done with the show, and then the president had called Fife and was talking to him, and of course he's on speaker, but he didn't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

692. He brought the conversation about the two questions that he asked when he was president.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

693. You know, like, who killed Kennedy, and are UFOs for real?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

694. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

695. Yeah, he didn't know either.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

696. He didn't have a need to know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

697. Apparently.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

698. But they all--
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

699. All time has been yielded.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

700. They all last time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

701. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

702. Let me take this back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

703. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

704. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

705. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

706. You, too, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

707. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

708. One thing you said, Sergeant Pennington, in that last-- and the more you talk, the more information we get by the way.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

709. But you did say something, if you take UFOs out of it, that is the issue, UFOs out of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

710. Period.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

711. That's it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

712. Next.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

713. Congressman Cook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

714. I would follow the chair's admonition to focus my questions on the incident, with one exception.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

715. I'd like to turn back to the medical records, because I think in the context that you open up maybe a small file, as far as most people would consider, you might be able to take a truth embargo blockade and maybe move it at a break of the time, but that's where major cracks start occurring and where things start falling into place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

716. Now, if this panel, for example, and I'm going to talk to each one to see if I could get them to sign a letter that I'm going to be asking them to help compose to both the Veterans Administration and to the President of the United States, because we've had, wait till you hear what's going to be in the letter, you may not be so enthused.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

717. I figure you've had three very strong United States senators fighting with the Veterans Administration.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

718. I think it's time to ask President Obama himself in the letter, maybe we'll initially send it to Veterans with a copy to him, and then we'll send it to the President, I hope, or something, to ask for something very simple here, something that may not sound very dramatic to anybody, and that's Sergeant Burroughs and Sergeant Penniston's medical records, because I submit, if we see in those white gums, if we see in those heart problems at a young age of a recent Air Force person that served in England, if we find some of the other, and I can't remember, I wrote them all down, and I may have to talk to you again to get this letter, but I submit that if we find those kinds of evidences, and what there's no legal reason, I've even chatted with an attorney during the break to withhold a medical record, and I'm sure your attorneys probably would confirm what my attorney just told me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

719. I think this could be the start of that brick taking down process at least, so we'll know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

720. Now getting back to the incident, Bentwaters and Woodbridge, and I'd like to first focus this on Nick Pope.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

721. Now they're in Suffolk County, excuse my lack of geography of your country, but Ipswich, is that close?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

722. Yes, it is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

723. I just remember serving in Britain for my church, actually.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

724. We would go up to there to get American hamburgers, because quite honestly, with all due respect, the British wimpies just didn't meet our standards in those days, and the reason I'm asking that is because even though those are two RAF, Royal Air Force bases, how many American servicemen are surrounding those bases are on those bases, compared to how many British service people?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

725. The bases are prefaced as Royal Air Force, but essentially, sir, that's in name only.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

726. There is, I think, literally one or two British liaison officers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

727. I needed the clarification, so almost everybody there is an American serviceman?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

728. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

729. Okay, now this can explain maybe General Gabriel coming in there and just taking charge and upsetting the Minister of Defense at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

730. Again, yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

731. Because I'm going to ask Nick Pope this question directly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

732. If Gabriel hadn't been taking evidence the way it's outlined in your statement at the time, and taking it back to what Ramstein, Germany, or whatever it was, you said the Minister of Defense was upset.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

733. This was in the early stages of the Thatcher, the Iron Lady.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

734. What did he do about it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

735. What did the British ... Because this is a significant thing, a Minister of Defense not being happy with something the United States General just did.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

736. We've heard this stuff about nuclear weaponry, and I think there might be something very definitely to that, some kind of nuclear ... Well, the British have nukes, too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

737. It's not just the Americans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

738. But this must have been ... As you say, these were American-operated things, and I'm going to try to hurry this up a bit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

739. But what can you tell me about that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

740. Because clearly there's already lots of evidence of radiation, of something strange that had to be stopped immediately and covered up immediately.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

741. Doesn't necessarily mean UFO, as Mr. Penniston has absolutely told us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

742. But give us just a little more detail, so that we can get a sense of why so quickly?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

743. And I just take a minute, because I've got a lot ... I still have to get into the incident itself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

744. I've only got a few minutes left.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

745. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

746. Firstly, I apologize if I have inadvertently misled anyone in this point.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

747. I meant to say that the Ministry of Defense was corporately upset about this, not the minister, personally.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

748. But to just expand on that point, clearly America was always regarded by us in the Ministry of Defense as the senior partner within NATO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

749. And there was, I think, the best way I can characterize a sort of unwritten "don't criticize the Americans" rule.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

750. And so while you'll see in some of those British documents a discernible frustration with the way in which the Americans took over this investigation, that was never articulated in a more fulsome manner.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

751. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

752. Anyway, there is a very strong suspicion of nuclear weaponry information exchange or something going on here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

753. But we don't know.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

754. The question I have for Sergeant Peniston here, these two submittals to us today, my understanding is you drew this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

755. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

756. When was this first given after ... When did you draw this, first of all?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

757. I believe it was the 27th, 28th, 29th of December.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

758. So right within a day or two of the first?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

759. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

760. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

761. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

762. And what about this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

763. That was drawn last year.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

764. The one in my notebook is too squiggly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

765. I'm right in their free hand and I was nervous.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

766. And so I cleaned it up to show exactly what it looked like.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

767. And that's what it looked like, except ... But this is in the notebook that you did not throw away, am I right?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

768. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

769. This book is ... I still have it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

770. And you have to verify that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

771. The circular object at the bottom of it is actually on the top on the notes I have, and that's where it was on the craft, so ... Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

772. This is what I wanted to ask you next, but you answered it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

773. This was what you believe, and in the original notebook, this came from, was written, was done at the same central time?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

774. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

775. You say December, December of '80.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

776. The notebook was written in the real time, sir, at the time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

777. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

778. And you say this was on the craft?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

779. That's my observations and part of my report, yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

780. So when did anybody that's superior to you in the Air Force or anybody in the United States government at all see these, initially?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

781. When did you first submit these?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

782. The drawing, the rough drawing of the craft was done for OSI.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

783. It says right on there, OSI.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

784. Oh, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

785. Yeah, but I can't read it too well.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

786. That's a small print.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

787. Well, I was 20 ... I can't read whether it was '29 or '21, but that's ... Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

788. So it was in December, and I take it this was not submitted at that time?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

789. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

790. Unless you submitted the notebook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

791. The glyphs were not ... That was strange because in the interview I wrote down, I said there was glyphs, I said you wanted to see what the glyphs looked like, they didn't care about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

792. They knew.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

793. They knew.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

794. That's what I thought.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

795. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

796. Let's see.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

797. I have another minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

798. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

799. Well, let me ask you then.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

800. Who do you recall or what title of the person that you submitted this to and what were their reactions?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

801. OSI does not wear uniforms.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

802. Their ranks are restricted.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

803. But like I said, they had to be from another base or they either probably had to be State Department.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

804. The odd part ... When you said they had to be, was there a requirement or is that what your perception is?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

805. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

806. At that ... OSI doesn't work for the Wing Commander or Air Force or anything like that over there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

807. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

808. In the overseas capacity in England, they work for the State Department in London, working out in London.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

809. That's who they're ... So this is why you're saying the State Department knew full well what you were saying within days of when you said it or when you first described it to your own ... Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

810. And also with Mr. Pope, there's backup on how fast the MOD started investigating it too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

811. That with other people coming out there ... I mean, in a matter of days, there's people out there investigating it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

812. And if Mr. Pope could just quickly add anything there on that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

813. My understanding is that certain people came out to check potential nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological hazard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

814. One moment, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

815. The other gentleman, two extra minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

816. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

817. Go ahead.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

818. That was really all I wanted to say on that point, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

819. My understanding, again, as I say, is that it was the potential hazard that was of interest and really the potential NBC hazard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

820. And Sergeant Burroughs, I wanted to ask you, were you aware at the time that Sergeant Penniston was sending this to the OSI folks or not?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

821. No, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

822. You weren't.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

823. When did you learn about Sergeant Penniston's submittals?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

824. I can't give you the exact date.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

825. Approximately?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

826. It was in the early '90s when Colonel Hall released the three statements.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

827. And there was more information coming out.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

828. That is one of our questions, number one, why the memo was ever released; number two, why the tape was ever released; and number three, why our statements were released.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

829. All that was done after we were told it was going to remain classified and we didn't have to worry about it any longer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

830. And give me, again, a sense of the dates on those real quickly here, of when those different releases occurred.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

831. Memo came out, I believe, in '83, right, Nick, when News of the World took it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

832. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

833. In 1983, the memo through Freedom of Information Act was released to the general public shortly after the tape was released and put all over the air.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

834. And last but not least, our statements were released in the early '90s by Colonel Hall.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

835. And one thing I'd like to add, this is my take personally from talking to the Colonel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

836. I believe he wants to talk more, but because it's still classified, I believe he feels -- and he's gone on the record saying that he'd be willing to talk about what he knew if the members of Congress would bring him in, swear him in, and he would have the protection given to him to talk about what is classified and what's going on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

837. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

838. Let me make sure I understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

839. Is this the same Colonel that worked for Gabriel at the time?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

840. No.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

841. Colonel Hall was the deputy base commander.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

842. Oh, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

843. Their names are similar.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

844. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

845. Colonel Hall, I believe, would come forward and he's made statements to the fact that he would be willing to testify everything he knew in front of Congress.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

846. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

847. Well, let me just ask you then if Nick, you know, or if Sergeant Penniston, you know, or anybody else that might know, within a day or two of the December 26th -- or first sighting, let's say, the memo clearly showed some indents in the part of the forest where you described the craft as being.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

848. Am I right about that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

849. That's correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

850. There's no question about -- There's no question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

851. None.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

852. And he wrote that memo, the Colonel that was assigned to General Gabriel that did get released from -- that was the one letter or the one memo we have was -- I'm just trying to make sure I got this right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

853. I'm not sure where he's going with this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

854. I'm not -- Colonel Hall -- I'm not going anywhere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

855. I'm just trying to gather data.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

856. Colonel Hall -- Excuse me, just one moment.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

857. The general in time has expired.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

858. Would you like another minute?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

859. Just one minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

860. Just one last minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

861. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

862. And I apologize for -- That's okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

863. I'll try to explain the chain of command.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

864. Yeah, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

865. General Gabriel was in charge of the entire USAFE area.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

866. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

867. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

868. General Bazley was the third Air Force commander.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

869. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

870. Colonel Hall would have worked for Colonel Conrad and General Williams.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

871. So he wrote the memo -- Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

872. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

873. And what he did was he was told to, after General Williams took the tape to General Basely, and they came back -- this was the exact words of Colonel Hall -- the staff got together, reviewed the tape, and they said, "We don't want to touch this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

874. This is a British problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

875. Come back."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

876. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

877. General Williams came back to Colonel Hall and said, "Go ahead and write up a brief memo and brief the British on what happened."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

878. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

879. But that memo definitely talks about those indentations.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

880. It definitely talks about a much higher than normal radiation level that he checked out a day later.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

881. That's what I needed to understand.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

882. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

883. I yield back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

884. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

885. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

886. No, no.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

887. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

888. But Carlson Bartlett would like to ask an additional question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
