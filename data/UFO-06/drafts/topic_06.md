545. Very quickly, how many people...I mean, when I first heard you speak about this object that lit up the sky and that you observed and touched, how many people knew about that?
→ {"text": "很快問一下，有多少人⋯⋯我的意思是，當我第一次聽到你講述這個照亮天空、你觀察並觸摸過的物體時，有多少人知道那件事？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

546. I mean, was that reported in the press?
→ {"text": "我是說，這有在媒體上報導嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

547. I mean, you're near a base, was there a lot of members at your base that knew about this?
→ {"text": "我的意思是，你們靠近基地，你們基地有很多人知道這件事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

548. There was quite a few people at the base that knew about it, the people that had the need to know.

549. There's other people that have seen stuff in the sky.
→ {"text": "還有其他人看到天空中的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

550. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

551. I mean, there had to be some...if it came from the sky, somebody had to see it.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，一定有一些⋯⋯如果它是從天上來的，一定有人看到它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

552. There's a civilian, and he's been on the record.
→ {"text": "有一位平民，他已經公開作證了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

553. His name is Jerry Harris.
→ {"text": "他的名字是 Jerry Harris。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

554. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

555. He lived just off base.
→ {"text": "他就住在基地旁邊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

556. And you know, of course, I got to talk to him a number of years later.
→ {"text": "你知道，當然，我多年後才有機會跟他談話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

557. And he says, "Well, you know, I noticed stuff was going on."
→ {"text": "他說：「嗯，你知道，我注意到有事情發生。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

558. He says, "I seen, you know, this light over the...canopy of light over the forest."

559. He says, "Then I see all this activity."

560. I think they were talking about the third night with John, I'm not sure.
→ {"text": "我想他們談論的是跟 John 一起經歷的第三晚，我不確定。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

561. And he says, "It was all unusual stuff," he says.
→ {"text": "他說：「那些都是不尋常的東西。」他說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

562. So there was concern.
→ {"text": "所以確實有人關切。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

563. And then he also worked...I guess he had a car shop, he worked on automotive stuff.
→ {"text": "然後他也工作⋯⋯我想他有間汽車修理廠，他做汽車維修的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

564. And people from the base used that.
→ {"text": "基地的人會使用那間店。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

565. And of course, the Scuttlebutt, which was running amok, about some kind of UFO, and that was actually the cover story, has been seen, and they just started to put more of those stories out.
→ {"text": "當然，關於某種不明飛行物的小道消息四處流傳，而那實際上就是掩護故事，已經被人看到了，他們就開始散佈更多這類故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Scuttlebutt 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「小道消息」"}

566. And I think that's what deflated the situation with the civilian population, because we were close with our British neighbors, or I mean, that they would not...you know, they heard things like, "We visited pubs, we went to the local economy, we did all that stuff."
→ {"text": "我認為這就是讓平民的關注降溫的原因，因為我們跟英國鄰居關係密切，或者我是說，他們不會⋯⋯你知道，他們聽到的是這樣的事：「我們去酒館、我們參與當地經濟、我們做了那些事。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

567. So there was chatter going on, I'm sure, and you know, unfortunately, what the chatter they were hearing was not true.
→ {"text": "所以確實有流言在傳，我確定，而且你知道，不幸的是，他們聽到的那些流言並不真實。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

568. It was a cover.
→ {"text": "那是掩護。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

569. And one of the interesting part about it, and it came out in Sky, whatever book that was, Sky something, Skycrash, yeah.
→ {"text": "其中一個有趣的部分，出現在那本書裡，Sky 什麼的，對，Skycrash。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

570. There was three British investigators that was investigating it, initially in '83.
→ {"text": "有三位英國調查員在調查這件事，最初是在 1983 年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

571. And one of the things they talk about, and first of all, is what happened, and it's the cover story.
→ {"text": "他們談論的其中一件事，首先，就是發生了什麼，而那就是掩護故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

572. They don't even know they're talking about the cover story, it's hilarious.
→ {"text": "他們甚至不知道自己在談論掩護故事，這太好笑了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

573. But we did, it was good containment, I mean, it was working well.
→ {"text": "但我們做到了，這是很好的封鎖，我是說，運作得很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

574. Then in '83, the news of the world, I had a disgruntled airman, apparently, talk to him, and they put that story out.
→ {"text": "然後在 1983 年，《世界新聞報》，顯然有個不滿的空軍人員跟他們談話，他們就把那個故事刊登出來了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "News of the World 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為《世界新聞報》"}

575. And that was the cover story, I mean, it wasn't the right story, so it worked, it worked well.
→ {"text": "而那就是掩護故事，我是說，那不是真實的故事，所以它奏效了，運作得很好。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

576. And then the other thing is, I got asked downtown about, "Hey, tell us about that situation out the base."
→ {"text": "然後另一件事是，我在市區被問到：「嘿，跟我們說說基地外面那個情況。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

577. What situation out the base?
→ {"text": "基地外面什麼情況？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

578. Now, you know, I'm really good at evasive stuff, I said, "What, the PLL trucks, or what, or the plane that came in, or what are you talking about?"
→ {"text": "現在，你知道，我非常擅長迴避，我說：「什麼，PLL 卡車嗎，或什麼，或是飛來的飛機，或你在說什麼？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

579. "No, no, no, no, about that, your wing commander talking to the UFO people, that's the stuff they would say, I mean, it's all cover."
→ {"text": "「不、不、不、不，關於那個，你們聯隊指揮官跟不明飛行物的人談話，他們會說那種東西，我是說，全都是掩護。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Wing Commander 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「聯隊指揮官」"}

580. So we had that kind of chatter, and after a while, you know, it's just, it's a laughable situation for people.
→ {"text": "所以我們有那種流言，過了一陣子，你知道，對人們來說這只是個可笑的情況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

581. But you were, were you the only two that actually saw it and touched it?
→ {"text": "但你們，你們是僅有的兩個真的看到並觸摸它的人嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

582. No, ma'am.
→ {"text": "不是的，女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

583. That was, well, we had the full security flight working that night, and we had the full law enforcement.
→ {"text": "那是，嗯，我們那晚有完整的安全小組在工作，還有完整的執法人員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

584. And the difference between security and law enforcement, security protects the priority A, B, and C resources of the base, the operational, war-making stuff.
→ {"text": "安全和執法的區別是，安全保護基地的優先 A、B、C 級資源，那些作戰的、戰爭用途的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

585. Law enforcement, well, they're like the police for the base, you know, they do domestics and things like that.
→ {"text": "執法人員，嗯，他們就像基地的警察，你知道，他們處理家庭糾紛之類的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

586. And there were 60, approximately about 60 of them, it could have been 80 on some nights, we were transitioning earlier from the F-4s there to the A-10s, so there was still some overages in people, so.
→ {"text": "大約有 60 人，大概 60 個左右，有些晚上可能有 80 人，我們之前正在從 F-4 過渡到 A-10，所以人員還有些超編，所以。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

587. But totally, on both the two nights, I would say it's more like 160 people, trained observers, security force members.
→ {"text": "但總共，在這兩個晚上，我會說大概有 160 人，受過訓練的觀察者、安全部隊成員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

588. They didn't all keep quiet about this, surely?
→ {"text": "他們不可能全都對此保持沉默吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

589. The ones that were directly involved, yes.
→ {"text": "直接參與的那些人，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

590. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

591. Those are the, that's how it works, ma'am, orders, and you follow orders, I mean, there was ongoing investigation, it was classified.
→ {"text": "那些就是，事情就是這樣運作的，女士，命令，而你遵守命令，我是說，有持續進行的調查，這是機密。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Classified 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「機密」"}

592. You can't talk, oh, we don't have the privilege of Congress, we, we can't talk about things like that.
→ {"text": "你不能說，噢，我們沒有國會的特權，我們，我們不能談論那樣的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

593. It's criminal activity.
→ {"text": "這是犯罪行為。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

594. They don't use the privilege.
→ {"text": "他們不使用那個特權。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

595. Sometimes they don't use the privilege, you're right.
→ {"text": "有時候他們不使用那個特權，你說得對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

596. So how many other people, are there any other people in your situation that were there, I mean, that may have touched it, or?
→ {"text": "那麼還有多少其他人，有沒有其他人跟你們一樣在那裡，我是說，可能觸摸過它，或者？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

597. There are, not touching it, like I said, I got the distinct.
→ {"text": "有的，沒有觸摸它，就像我說的，我有這個特殊經歷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

598. Or being close by, or?
→ {"text": "或是靠近它，或者？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

599. Close by, I mean, you're talking within 100 to 200 feet, that was the East Gate area, we had a restricted area that was down there that housed A-10s, they were parked in hardened structures down there, and we had security response teams that were patrolling those areas, alarm response teams, entry controllers, we had those kind of people that were working, and what happened is the control center put a order across the net saying everybody just stop transmissions and let us talk and do what we were doing out there, that was the security situation.
→ {"text": "靠近它，我是說，你說的是在 100 到 200 英呎範圍內，那是東門區域，我們在那裡有個限制區，停放著 A-10，它們停在那裡的加固結構中，我們有安全反應小組在那些區域巡邏、警報反應小組、入口管制人員，我們有那類人在工作，而發生的情況是控制中心透過無線網發出命令，要求大家停止傳輸，讓我們說話並做我們在那裡做的事，那就是安全狀況。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

600. And everybody got to listen, everybody unfortunately probably watched, I mean, they should be doing their job.
→ {"text": "每個人都聽到了，每個人不幸地可能都在看，我是說，他們應該做自己的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

601. At that time you should heighten your security a little bit more, you know, if there's something going off the base, don't, you know, start collecting in an area, but those are some mistakes that were probably made, some vulnerabilities that we did that probably shouldn't be known either, but they happened and it was 30 something years ago, it doesn't matter now, yeah, there's probably some things that were not correctly done, but it was out of curiosity, people were doing that.
→ {"text": "那時候你應該提高一點警戒，你知道，如果基地外有什麼事發生，不要，你知道，開始聚集在一個區域，但那些是可能犯下的一些錯誤，一些我們造成的漏洞，可能也不該被知道，但它們發生了，而那是 30 多年前的事了，現在無所謂了，是的，可能有些事情沒有正確處理，但那是出於好奇，人們才那樣做的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

602. Right, I mean, why wouldn't you be curious about what had happened?
→ {"text": "對，我是說，你怎麼會不對發生的事感到好奇？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

603. So is there anybody else that's in the same situation you are, would any of these people that sort of knew about it because they were close by, would they cover up, would they be part of the cover-up?
→ {"text": "所以還有其他人跟你們處境相同嗎，那些因為靠近而某種程度上知道這件事的人，他們會掩蓋嗎，他們會是真相掩蓋的一部分嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Cover-up 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「真相掩蓋」"}

604. What are you doing?
→ {"text": "你在做什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

605. Can I ask you?
→ {"text": "我能問你嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

606. Yeah, go ahead.
→ {"text": "可以，請說。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

607. Okay, ma'am, what's interesting is the fact that of the three nights, only five statements have surfaced from what went on.
→ {"text": "好的，女士，有趣的是這三個晚上發生的事，只有五份陳述浮出水面。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

608. The first night there were three of us in one out there, the second night you had the shift commander and the on-duty flight chief, on the third night Colonel Hall took a team out there and there was also other personnel in the woods and different people saw different things, so that's one of the reasons why we come forward besides our health issues is I feel it's necessary that anyone that was even out in that area should have the opportunity to be checked out medically and be told what they were exposed to, especially something that's over 30 years old.
→ {"text": "第一晚我們有三個人在那裡，第二晚有輪班指揮官和值班飛行長，第三晚 Colonel Hall 帶了一支隊伍去那裡，還有其他人員在樹林裡，不同的人看到不同的東西，所以這就是我們挺身而出的原因之一，除了我們的健康問題之外，我覺得任何曾經在那個區域的人都應該有機會接受醫療檢查，並被告知他們接觸了什麼，尤其是超過 30 年的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Colonel Hall 即 Halt 上校"}

609. That's one of the questions he asked me first up, he goes, what the heck was going on out there that would draw this much attention from the agencies involved to this day?
→ {"text": "這是他最先問我的問題之一，他說，那裡到底發生了什麼事，會引來相關機構到今天還如此關注？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

610. What would still be classified and if it is, what did we have or what were we dealing with that would still remain silent today?
→ {"text": "什麼東西會仍然被列為機密，如果是這樣，我們有什麼或我們在處理什麼，會到今天仍然保持沉默？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Classified 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「機密」"}

611. Almost every weapon we've ever developed back in that time frame has been exposed that we're aware of and yet today this is still classified and we can't even receive medical treatment for it.
→ {"text": "我們在那個時期開發的幾乎所有我們知道的武器都已經曝光了，然而今天這仍然是機密，我們甚至無法為此接受醫療治療。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Classified 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「機密」"}

612. Should we tell them about what happened with OSI?
→ {"text": "我們應該告訴他們特別調查處發生的事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "OSI 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「特別調查處」"}

613. Oh, yes, one other thing that happened that when we sent our FOIA request, OSI blew their time limit and after we made certain announcements, yes, they blew it by ear, but our attorney can go into detail the contact we had in a make-up form they asked us to sign implying that we could be perjuring ourselves.
→ {"text": "噢，是的，還有一件事發生了，當我們提交《資訊自由法》申請時，特別調查處違反了他們的時限，而在我們發表某些聲明之後，是的，他們嚴重違反了，但我們的律師可以詳細說明我們收到的接觸，他們要求我們簽署一份捏造的表格，暗示我們可能在作偽證。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "FOIA request 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為《資訊自由法》申請；OSI 翻譯為「特別調查處」"}

614. So they're trying to throw intimidation 32 years later?
→ {"text": "所以他們在 32 年後試圖恐嚇你們？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

615. They're trying to intimidate you.
→ {"text": "他們試圖恐嚇你們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

616. Are you kidding me?
→ {"text": "你在開玩笑嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

617. I mean, you think we-- I can see that you've been intimidated.
→ {"text": "我是說，你覺得我們⋯⋯我可以看出你們被恐嚇了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

618. Yeah, we're intimidated.
→ {"text": "是的，我們被恐嚇了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

619. We laughed about it.
→ {"text": "我們對此一笑置之。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

620. Is that the best they got?
→ {"text": "這就是他們最好的手段嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

621. Is that the best they can do after 32 years, is try the intimidation-- it had a made-up form, ma'am.
→ {"text": "這就是他們 32 年後能做的最好的事，試圖恐嚇⋯⋯那是一份捏造的表格，女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

622. I mean, come on.
→ {"text": "我是說，拜託。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

623. You think we're idiots?
→ {"text": "你覺得我們是白痴嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

624. You know, that was a made-up form and then you had contact, too, also our attorney, which shook him up a little bit, I think, because he wasn't-- were you okay with that?
→ {"text": "你知道，那是一份捏造的表格，然後你也有接觸，還有我們的律師，我想這讓他有點震驚，因為他沒有⋯⋯你對此還好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

625. I've had the NSA call me on my cell phone just to see how I was doing and so, now, remember I used the word "weird" earlier.
→ {"text": "國家安全局打電話到我的手機，只是想看看我過得怎麼樣，所以，現在，記得我之前用了「詭異」這個詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "NSA 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「國家安全局」"}

626. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

627. This is another example of, you know-- So why the interest 32 years later if nothing happened?
→ {"text": "這是另一個例子，你知道⋯⋯那麼如果什麼都沒發生，為什麼 32 年後還有興趣？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

628. And why did they blow what's under the law, the FOIA requests?
→ {"text": "為什麼他們違反法律規定，違反《資訊自由法》申請的規定？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "FOIA requests 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為《資訊自由法》申請"}

629. They refused to answer our second-- what we submitted, which was a little different than the first time, but the excuse they used was they'd already answered the first FOIA request, so they're not going to answer the second FOIA request.
→ {"text": "他們拒絕回答我們第二次⋯⋯我們提交的內容，跟第一次稍有不同，但他們使用的藉口是他們已經回答了第一次《資訊自由法》申請，所以他們不會回答第二次《資訊自由法》申請。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "FOIA request 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為《資訊自由法》申請"}

630. What are they hiding until this day?

631. You know, those dogs don't hunt.

633. They're telling us stuff like they think we're airmen.
→ {"text": "他們跟我們說那些東西，好像以為我們是菜鳥空軍人員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

634. I mean, like, just two years, five years in, oh, no, no, we're grown men.
→ {"text": "我是說，就像服役兩年、五年的，噢，不、不，我們是成年人了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

635. That stuff, I think, is not going to work with us.
→ {"text": "我認為那套東西對我們不管用。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

636. And you think we're going to-- I'll make the record clear, we're not going to sit back and take anything from the United States government right now at this point.
→ {"text": "而你覺得我們會⋯⋯我要說清楚，我們現在不會袖手旁觀，接受美國政府的任何說法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

637. I mean, we're here to go ahead and clear this up the best we can and to get answers.

640. I mean, we're going to continue to do that.

→ {"text": "是的，我認為如果⋯⋯如果我們沒有那些限制條件⋯⋯抱歉，請稍等一下，記錄一下⋯⋯女眾議員，請再給兩分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "如果我們當時沒有加諸在指揮結構上的那些限制條件，還有那些機密文件⋯⋯以及正在進行的計畫，現在已經解密了，我們稍後會談論它們。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Classified 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「機密」"}

→ {"text": "我不認為⋯⋯我認為這樣⋯⋯讓我改變一下我對這件事的想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

652. If you look at the-- take a look at the Bentwaters incident, the Reynolds and Forest incident, not as a UFO incident, but as an incident that is going to cause, apparently, the DLD and other federal agencies grief if any of that information got out.
→ {"text": "如果你看看⋯⋯看看本特沃特斯事件、倫德沙姆森林事件，不是作為不明飛行物事件，而是作為一個顯然會給國防部和其他聯邦機構帶來麻煩的事件，如果任何資訊洩露出去的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Bentwaters 即 RAF Bentwaters；DLD 應為 DOD（國防部）的誤聽"}

→ {"text": "為什麼有東西如此機密，以至於不能洩露出去？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Classified 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「機密」"}

→ {"text": "我認為這是因為過去 85 年來所說的謊言。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

657. I think they don't want the real truth to come out, not because they-- American people can't handle it, because they don't want to get caught with their pants down.
→ {"text": "我認為他們不想讓真相曝光，不是因為⋯⋯美國人民無法承受，而是因為他們不想被抓到措手不及。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "英語習語 caught with their pants down 意指被當場抓包"}

661. If you ask a question to the United States government, anybody, you say, "Tell me what you know about UFOs."
→ {"text": "如果你向美國政府提問，任何人，你說：「告訴我你對不明飛行物的了解。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

662. Well, you know what, that's not the right question.
→ {"text": "嗯，你知道嗎，那不是正確的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

663. What you've got to do is you've got to ask the right questions to whatever agency you're asking.
→ {"text": "你必須做的是，你必須向你詢問的任何機構提出正確的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

664. You've got to be very specific of what you're asking.
→ {"text": "你必須非常具體地說明你在問什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

665. You know what I'm saying.
→ {"text": "你明白我的意思。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

666. "Tell me about UFOs."
→ {"text": "「告訴我關於不明飛行物的事。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

667. Oh, no.
→ {"text": "噢，不行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

668. UFOs don't exist.

669. UFOs, that's UFOs.

670. They don't-- they don't give you any answers.

## Speaker Group 16

671. I yield a half a minute.

## Speaker Group 17

672. Oh, sorry.
→ {"text": "噢，抱歉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 18

673. Let me help you on that one.
→ {"text": "讓我幫你回答這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 19

674. Sure.
→ {"text": "當然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 20

675. When the issue is brought before the White House, the White House says there's nothing out there.
→ {"text": "當這個議題被提交到白宮，白宮說那裡什麼都沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

676. You know, nothing's gone on.
→ {"text": "你知道，什麼都沒發生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

677. Nothing's being covered up.
→ {"text": "沒有任何東西被掩蓋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

678. So in order to back up the White House, the whole chain of command within the government continues this mockery of not telling the truth, because this is the position of the White House.
→ {"text": "所以為了支持白宮，政府內部整個指揮鏈繼續這種不說真話的荒謬行為，因為這是白宮的立場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

679. If the White House came out and said, "Oh, there is," then all bets would be off.
→ {"text": "如果白宮出面說：「噢，確實有。」那麼一切就都不一樣了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

680. So it starts there, and it ends down at you.
→ {"text": "所以它從那裡開始，最後落到你們身上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 21

681. I think it's bigger than that, though.
→ {"text": "不過，我認為問題比那更大。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

682. I think it's-- I think presidents come and go.
→ {"text": "我認為⋯⋯我認為總統來來去去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 22

683. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 23

684. Okay?
→ {"text": "好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 24

685. Yes, they do.
→ {"text": "是的，確實如此。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 25

686. I think you folks come and go.
→ {"text": "我認為你們這些人也來來去去。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

687. I don't think-- I don't think these secrets are general knowledge to you folks, or what-- or to presidents, okay?
→ {"text": "我不認為⋯⋯我不認為這些秘密是你們這些人的常識，或什麼⋯⋯或總統的常識，好嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

688. That's my thoughts on it.
→ {"text": "這就是我對此的想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

689. An interesting conversation I'll share with you.
→ {"text": "我要跟你們分享一段有趣的對話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

690. We were coming back from a Larry King show in 2007, and Governor Symington was in there, and he was, I guess, friends with President Clinton, or still is, or some kind of situation with their friends.
→ {"text": "我們在 2007 年從 Larry King 的節目回來，賽明頓州長在那裡，我想他跟柯林頓總統是朋友，或者仍然是，或者他們有某種朋友關係。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文錯誤：Governor Simonton 應為 Governor Symington（賽明頓州長，亞利桑那州前州長，鳳凰城光點事件目擊者）；President Clinton 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「柯林頓總統」"}

691. So we got done with the show, and then the president had called Fife and was talking to him, and of course he's on speaker, but he didn't know.
→ {"text": "所以我們錄完節目，然後總統打電話給 Fife 跟他說話，當然是開擴音，但他不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Fife 即 Fife Symington（賽明頓州長）"}

692. He brought the conversation about the two questions that he asked when he was president.
→ {"text": "他提起當他當總統時問過的兩個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

693. You know, like, who killed Kennedy, and are UFOs for real?
→ {"text": "你知道，就像，誰殺了甘迺迪，還有不明飛行物是真的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 26

694. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 27

695. Yeah, he didn't know either.
→ {"text": "是的，他也不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

696. He didn't have a need to know.
→ {"text": "他沒有知道的必要。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

697. Apparently.
→ {"text": "顯然。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 28

698. But they all--
→ {"text": "但他們全都⋯⋯", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 29

699. All time has been yielded.
→ {"text": "所有時間都已讓出。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 30

700. They all last time.
→ {"text": "他們上次都。", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文語意不完整"}

701. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 31

702. Let me take this back.
→ {"text": "讓我收回這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 32

703. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 33

704. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

705. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

706. You, too, sir.
→ {"text": "您也是，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

707. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

708. One thing you said, Sergeant Pennington, in that last-- and the more you talk, the more information we get by the way.
→ {"text": "你說的一件事，Penniston 中士，在剛才⋯⋯順帶一提，你說得越多，我們得到的資訊就越多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文錯誤：Sergeant Pennington 應為 Sergeant Penniston"}

709. But you did say something, if you take UFOs out of it, that is the issue, UFOs out of it.
→ {"text": "但你確實說了一件事，如果你把不明飛行物拿掉，那就是問題所在，把不明飛行物拿掉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

710. Period.
→ {"text": "就是這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

711. That's it.
→ {"text": "就這樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

712. Next.
→ {"text": "下一位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

713. Congressman Cook.
→ {"text": "Cook 眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}


## Speaker Group 34

714. I would follow the chair's admonition to focus my questions on the incident, with one exception.
→ {"text": "我會遵循主席的告誡，把問題集中在這個事件上，但有一個例外。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

715. I'd like to turn back to the medical records, because I think in the context that you open up maybe a small file, as far as most people would consider, you might be able to take a truth embargo blockade and maybe move it at a break of the time, but that's where major cracks start occurring and where things start falling into place.
→ {"text": "我想回到醫療紀錄這個話題，因為我認為在你打開也許是一個小檔案的情況下，就大多數人會認為的，你可能能夠突破真相封鎖，也許在這個時刻撬動它，但這就是開始出現重大裂痕、事情開始到位的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Truth embargo 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「真相封鎖」"}

716. Now, if this panel, for example, and I'm going to talk to each one to see if I could get them to sign a letter that I'm going to be asking them to help compose to both the Veterans Administration and to the President of the United States, because we've had, wait till you hear what's going to be in the letter, you may not be so enthused.
→ {"text": "現在，比如說，如果這個小組，我會跟每一位談談，看看我能否讓他們簽署一封信，我會請他們幫忙起草致退伍軍人事務部和美國總統的信，因為我們已經，等你聽到信裡會寫什麼，你可能不會那麼熱衷。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Veterans Administration 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「退伍軍人事務部」"}

717. I figure you've had three very strong United States senators fighting with the Veterans Administration.
→ {"text": "我想你們已經有三位非常強勢的美國參議員在跟退伍軍人事務部抗爭了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Veterans Administration 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「退伍軍人事務部」"}

718. I think it's time to ask President Obama himself in the letter, maybe we'll initially send it to Veterans with a copy to him, and then we'll send it to the President, I hope, or something, to ask for something very simple here, something that may not sound very dramatic to anybody, and that's Sergeant Burroughs and Sergeant Penniston's medical records, because I submit, if we see in those white gums, if we see in those heart problems at a young age of a recent Air Force person that served in England, if we find some of the other, and I can't remember, I wrote them all down, and I may have to talk to you again to get this letter, but I submit that if we find those kinds of evidences, and what there's no legal reason, I've even chatted with an attorney during the break to withhold a medical record, and I'm sure your attorneys probably would confirm what my attorney just told me.
→ {"text": "我認為是時候在信中請歐巴馬總統本人，也許我們一開始會寄給退伍軍人事務部並副本給他，然後我們會寄給總統，我希望，或者類似的，在這裡要求一件非常簡單的事，一件對任何人來說可能聽起來都不太戲劇性的事，那就是巴勒斯中士和佩尼斯頓中士的醫療紀錄，因為我認為，如果我們在那些白色牙齦中看到，如果我們看到那些在英國服役的年輕空軍人員的心臟問題，如果我們發現其他一些，我記不得了，我把它們都寫下來了，我可能得再跟你談談才能寫這封信，但我認為如果我們發現那些證據，而且沒有法律理由，我甚至在休息時跟一位律師聊過關於隱瞞醫療紀錄的事，我確信你們的律師可能會證實我的律師剛才告訴我的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文錯誤：Sergeant Paniston 應為 Sergeant Penniston（佩尼斯頓中士）；Veterans Administration 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「退伍軍人事務部」"}

719. I think this could be the start of that brick taking down process at least, so we'll know.
→ {"text": "我認為這至少可以是那個拆除過程的開始，這樣我們就會知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

720. Now getting back to the incident, Bentwaters and Woodbridge, and I'd like to first focus this on Nick Pope.
→ {"text": "現在回到事件本身，本特沃特斯和伍德布里奇，我想首先把焦點放在 Nick Pope 身上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Bentwaters 即 RAF Bentwaters；Woodbridge 即 RAF Woodbridge"}

721. Now they're in Suffolk County, excuse my lack of geography of your country, but Ipswich, is that close?
→ {"text": "現在它們在薩福克郡，抱歉我對你們國家的地理不熟，但伊普斯威奇，那很近嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

722. Yes, it is.
→ {"text": "是的，很近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

723. I just remember serving in Britain for my church, actually.
→ {"text": "我只記得我實際上在英國為我的教會服務過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

724. We would go up to there to get American hamburgers, because quite honestly, with all due respect, the British wimpies just didn't meet our standards in those days, and the reason I'm asking that is because even though those are two RAF, Royal Air Force bases, how many American servicemen are surrounding those bases are on those bases, compared to how many British service people?
→ {"text": "我們會去那裡買美式漢堡，因為說實話，恕我直言，英國的 Wimpy 漢堡在那些日子裡不符合我們的標準，我問這個的原因是，雖然那些是兩個皇家空軍基地，但有多少美國軍人在那些基地周圍或在那些基地上，相比有多少英國軍人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": "RAF 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「皇家空軍」"}

725. The bases are prefaced as Royal Air Force, but essentially, sir, that's in name only.
→ {"text": "這些基地冠以皇家空軍之名，但基本上，先生，那只是名義上的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

726. There is, I think, literally one or two British liaison officers.
→ {"text": "我想，實際上只有一兩名英國聯絡官。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

727. I needed the clarification, so almost everybody there is an American serviceman?
→ {"text": "我需要澄清，所以那裡幾乎每個人都是美國軍人？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

728. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

729. Okay, now this can explain maybe General Gabriel coming in there and just taking charge and upsetting the Minister of Defense at the time.
→ {"text": "好的，現在這也許可以解釋加百列將軍進來並接管，讓當時的國防部長不高興。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "General Gabriel 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「加百列將軍」；Minister of Defense 即 Ministry of Defence"}

730. Again, yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

731. Because I'm going to ask Nick Pope this question directly.
→ {"text": "因為我要直接問 Nick Pope 這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

732. If Gabriel hadn't been taking evidence the way it's outlined in your statement at the time, and taking it back to what Ramstein, Germany, or whatever it was, you said the Minister of Defense was upset.
→ {"text": "如果加百列沒有像你當時陳述中概述的那樣收集證據，並將其帶回德國拉姆施泰因，或不管是哪裡，你說國防部長很不高興。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文錯誤：Rheinstein 應為 Ramstein（拉姆施泰因空軍基地）；Ramstein 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「拉姆施泰因空軍基地」"}

733. This was in the early stages of the Thatcher, the Iron Lady.
→ {"text": "這是在柴契爾夫人、鐵娘子的早期階段。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

734. What did he do about it?
→ {"text": "他對此做了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

735. What did the British ... Because this is a significant thing, a Minister of Defense not being happy with something the United States General just did.
→ {"text": "英國人做了什麼⋯⋯因為這是一件重要的事，國防部長對美國將軍剛做的事不高興。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

736. We've heard this stuff about nuclear weaponry, and I think there might be something very definitely to that, some kind of nuclear ... Well, the British have nukes, too.
→ {"text": "我們聽過關於核武器的這些事，我認為可能確實有些道理，某種核⋯⋯嗯，英國也有核武器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

737. It's not just the Americans.
→ {"text": "不只是美國人有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

738. But this must have been ... As you say, these were American-operated things, and I'm going to try to hurry this up a bit.
→ {"text": "但這一定是⋯⋯如你所說，這些是美國運作的東西，我會試著加快一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

739. But what can you tell me about that?
→ {"text": "但你能告訴我關於那件事的什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

740. Because clearly there's already lots of evidence of radiation, of something strange that had to be stopped immediately and covered up immediately.
→ {"text": "因為顯然已經有很多關於輻射的證據，某種奇怪的東西必須立即被制止並立即被掩蓋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

741. Doesn't necessarily mean UFO, as Mr. Penniston has absolutely told us.
→ {"text": "這不一定意味著不明飛行物，正如 Penniston 先生明確告訴我們的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

742. But give us just a little more detail, so that we can get a sense of why so quickly?
→ {"text": "但請給我們多一點細節，這樣我們就能了解為什麼這麼快？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

743. And I just take a minute, because I've got a lot ... I still have to get into the incident itself.
→ {"text": "我只需要一分鐘，因為我有很多⋯⋯我還必須深入事件本身。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

744. I've only got a few minutes left.
→ {"text": "我只剩下幾分鐘了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

745. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

746. Firstly, I apologize if I have inadvertently misled anyone in this point.
→ {"text": "首先，如果我在這一點上無意中誤導了任何人，我道歉。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

747. I meant to say that the Ministry of Defense was corporately upset about this, not the minister, personally.
→ {"text": "我想說的是國防部整體對此感到不滿，而不是部長個人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "Ministry of Defense 根據 terminology.yaml 翻譯為「國防部」"}

748. But to just expand on that point, clearly America was always regarded by us in the Ministry of Defense as the senior partner within NATO.
→ {"text": "但進一步說明這一點，很明顯，美國一直被我們國防部視為北約的資深夥伴。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

749. And there was, I think, the best way I can characterize a sort of unwritten "don't criticize the Americans" rule.
→ {"text": "而且我認為，我能形容的最好方式是一種不成文的「不批評美國人」的規則。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

750. And so while you'll see in some of those British documents a discernible frustration with the way in which the Americans took over this investigation, that was never articulated in a more fulsome manner.
→ {"text": "所以雖然你會在一些英國文件中看到對美國人接管這項調查的方式明顯感到沮喪，但這從未以更充分的方式表達出來。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

751. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

752. Anyway, there is a very strong suspicion of nuclear weaponry information exchange or something going on here.
→ {"text": "無論如何，這裡有非常強烈的懷疑涉及核武器資訊交換或類似的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

753. But we don't know.
→ {"text": "但我們不知道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

754. The question I have for Sergeant Peniston here, these two submittals to us today, my understanding is you drew this.
→ {"text": "我對 Penniston 中士的問題是，今天提交給我們的這兩份資料，我的理解是你畫了這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": "原文錯誤：Sergeant Peniston 應為 Sergeant Penniston"}

755. Yes, sir.
→ {"text": "是的，先生。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

756. When was this first given after ... When did you draw this, first of all?
→ {"text": "這在之後⋯⋯首先，你什麼時候畫的這個？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

757. I believe it was the 27th, 28th, 29th of December.
→ {"text": "我相信是 12 月 27、28、29 日。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

758. So right within a day or two of the first?

759. Yes.

760. Yes.

763. That was drawn last year.

764. The one in my notebook is too squiggly.

765. I'm right in their free hand and I was nervous.
→ {"text": "我當時徒手寫的，而且很緊張。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

766. And so I cleaned it up to show exactly what it looked like.
→ {"text": "所以我把它清理乾淨，以準確顯示它的樣子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

767. And that's what it looked like, except ... But this is in the notebook that you did not throw away, am I right?
→ {"text": "那就是它的樣子，除了⋯⋯但這在你沒有扔掉的筆記本裡，對吧？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

768. No.

769. This book is ... I still have it.

770. And you have to verify that.
→ {"text": "而且你必須證實這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

771. The circular object at the bottom of it is actually on the top on the notes I have, and that's where it was on the craft, so ... Okay.
→ {"text": "底部的圓形物體實際上在我筆記的頂部，那就是它在飛行器上的位置，所以⋯⋯好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

772. This is what I wanted to ask you next, but you answered it.

773. This was what you believe, and in the original notebook, this came from, was written, was done at the same central time?
→ {"text": "這是你相信的，而在原始筆記本中，這來自、被寫下、在同一時間完成的？", "confidence": "medium", "notes": "原文語意不太清楚"}

774. Right.
→ {"text": "對。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

775. You say December, December of '80.
→ {"text": "你說 12 月，1980 年 12 月。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

776. The notebook was written in the real time, sir, at the time.
→ {"text": "這個筆記本是即時寫的，先生，當時就寫了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

777. Okay.
→ {"text": "好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

778. And you say this was on the craft?
→ {"text": "你說這在飛行器上？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

779. That's my observations and part of my report, yes.
→ {"text": "那是我的觀察，也是我報告的一部分，是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

780. So when did anybody that's superior to you in the Air Force or anybody in the United States government at all see these, initially?
→ {"text": "那麼，最初何時有任何空軍中你的上級或美國政府的任何人看到這些？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

781. When did you first submit these?

785. Yeah, but I can't read it too well.

786. That's a small print.

787. Well, I was 20 ... I can't read whether it was '29 or '21, but that's ... Okay.

790. Unless you submitted the notebook.
