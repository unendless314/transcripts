      telling or describing the sight of the smoking gun to this, but just by what

      think part of the problem there was, they were drawn into the area, this object
      was drawn there because there was interest in the area and the interest has
      to do with a top secret facility which I later wrote security plans for and
      stuff at that base which was Marlesham Heath, it was a C3 facility, communications,
      and it had a building there that at the time had a retinal eye scanner, in 1980
      that's like high tech stuff and you don't really waste your money, the government's
      money on those kind of things over there like that but that was the unusual
      part of it so there was operations within there and they were civilian by the
      way, none of those people were wearing uniforms and then just down the street
      from that another mile and a half or two was MI6, British intelligence that
      operated out of there and then of course

      the context that you open up maybe a small file, as far as most people would
      consider, you might be able to take a truth embargo blockade and maybe move
      it at a break of the time, but that's where major cracks start occurring and
