219. Thank you.

220. Good morning, and I will not go over 10 minutes of my practice.
→ {"text": "早安，我的發言不會超過十分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

221. My name is Gary Heseltine, and I am a recently retired police detective in England, having served almost 24 years with the British Transport Police.
→ {"text": "我叫蓋瑞·海絲汀，是一名剛退休的英國警探，曾在英國運輸警察服務近24年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

222. For the majority of that time, for 20 years, I was a detective.
→ {"text": "在這段時間裡，有20年我擔任警探職務。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

223. I was dealing at the sharp end of evidential matters, having been involved in murder, manslaughter, rape, et cetera, et cetera.
→ {"text": "我處理的是證據調查的第一線工作，參與過謀殺、過失殺人、強姦等等案件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

224. I come to this subject on an evidential basis, and I think that is very necessary in this field.
→ {"text": "我是以證據為基礎來看待這個主題的，我認為這在這個領域是非常必要的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

225. I am here principally to speak on behalf of police officers worldwide who have witnessed UFOs, but I would also like to say that I am also one of the principal investigators of the Rendlesham Forest incident that my colleague, Peter, has alluded to, along with Linda Moulton-Howe.
→ {"text": "我今天主要是代表全球目擊過不明飛行物的警察來發言，但我也想說明，我也是蘭德沙姆森林事件的主要調查員之一，正如我的同事彼得所提到的，還有琳達·莫爾頓·豪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

226. I would consider her as the three principal investigators of this incident.
→ {"text": "我認為我們三人是這起事件的主要調查員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

227. We're all doing very good work on it.
→ {"text": "我們都在進行非常深入的調查工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

228. For the last five years, I have worked with Colonel Charles Holt, the man who wrote the Holt memorandum, the deputy base commander, of what was absolutely a nuclear facility.
→ {"text": "過去五年來，我一直與查爾斯·霍爾特上校合作，他就是撰寫霍爾特備忘錄的那位副基地指揮官，而那絕對是一座核武設施。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

229. And let me back that up by saying that for three years of my six years in the Royal Air Force, between 1983 and 1989, I served on two nuclear bases doing exactly the same job as what those U.S. Air Force policemen did, and the base at Bentwater is identical to the base that I was in West Germany where I worked.
→ {"text": "讓我用我的親身經歷來佐證這一點：在我於英國皇家空軍服役的六年中，從1983年到1989年間，有三年時間我在兩個核武基地服役，做的工作與那些美國空軍警察完全相同，而且本特沃特（Bentwater）基地與我在西德工作過的基地完全一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

230. Let's cut the crap.
→ {"text": "讓我們說清楚。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

231. This is a nuclear issue.
→ {"text": "這是一個涉及核武的問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

232. Right.
→ {"text": "沒錯。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

233. In January 2002, moving to my police background, I created the Police Reporting UFO Sightings Database.
→ {"text": "回到我的警察背景，2002年1月，我創建了警察目擊不明飛行物報告資料庫（Police Reporting UFO Sightings Database）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

234. It's commonly referred to as the Proof Force Police Database.
→ {"text": "它通常被簡稱為PRUFOS資料庫。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

235. You have an information pack with that information.
→ {"text": "各位手上有相關的資料包。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

236. It's basically there for U.K. police officers to record on- and off-duty police sightings.
→ {"text": "這個資料庫主要是為英國警察記錄值勤與非值勤期間的目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

237. Believe me, over the 11 years of my research, nothing will surprise me what anybody says in this field about what they report.
→ {"text": "相信我，在我11年的研究過程中，無論任何人在這個領域報告什麼，都不會讓我感到驚訝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

238. It is truly extraordinary.
→ {"text": "這些報告真的非常不尋常。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

239. When I began my research 11 years ago into British police officers, there were approximately six cases involving 10 officers.
→ {"text": "11年前當我開始研究英國警察的目擊案例時，大約只有6起案件涉及10名警察。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

240. Eleven years later, I now have over 425 cases involving over 940 British police officers.
→ {"text": "11年後的今天，我現在已經收集了超過425起案件，涉及超過940名英國警察。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

241. This is a significant amount, in my opinion.
→ {"text": "我認為這是一個相當可觀的數量。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

242. These sightings have taken place the length and breadth of Britain and have been reported at all times of the day.
→ {"text": "這些目擊事件發生在英國全境各地，並且在一天中的任何時段都有報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

243. Whilst I'm not a big lover of statistics because they can be manipulated, I would say that the key statistic for me is that over 70 percent of these cases are multiple witness officer cases.
→ {"text": "雖然我不是特別喜歡統計數據，因為它們可能被操縱，但我認為最關鍵的統計數據是，超過70%的案件是多名警察共同目擊的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

244. Therefore, it is significant corroboration to a sighting event—again, I look at this case through evidential eyes.
→ {"text": "因此，這對目擊事件來說是重要的佐證——我再次強調，我是以證據的角度來看待這些案件的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

245. In one particular case, there is in excess of 24 police officers that were involved in tracking at least one object over six counties of Britain on the night of March 30, 31, 1993.
→ {"text": "在一起特定案例中，超過24名警察在1993年3月30日至31日夜間，追蹤至少一個飛行物體橫越英國六個郡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

246. This is referred to as the Cosford Incident.
→ {"text": "這被稱為科斯福德事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

247. Many police officers have observed structured craft of huge size and proportions in close proximity to their ground positions.
→ {"text": "許多警察在非常接近地面的位置觀察到巨大的結構化飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

248. These craft range in shape and size and dimensions from many tens of feet to many hundreds of feet in size.
→ {"text": "這些飛行器的形狀、大小和尺寸從數十英呎到數百英呎不等。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

249. Many of the police cases on the database, in my opinion, are truly extraordinary.
→ {"text": "我認為資料庫中的許多警察案例確實非常不尋常。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

250. For example, in October 1984 near RAF Northolt, Middlesex, a silent black triangular object was seen at low altitude by two uniformed police officers on mobile patrol wallet, which they described as being the size of three football fields.
→ {"text": "例如，1984年10月在米德爾塞克斯郡RAF Northolt附近，兩名執行機動巡邏的制服警察在低空目擊一個無聲的黑色三角形物體，他們描述其大小相當於三個足球場。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

251. When I sought to clarify this description of size, they said when they saw it, it was above three football fields.
→ {"text": "當我試圖澄清這個大小描述時，他們說當他們看到它時，它就懸浮在三個足球場的上方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

252. I think that's pretty good representation of size.
→ {"text": "我認為這是一個相當好的大小參照。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

253. This report was made by Police Constable Robin Perry of the Metropolitan Police.
→ {"text": "這份報告是由倫敦警察廳（Metropolitan Police）的警員羅賓·佩里（Robin Perry）提出的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

254. On another occasion in October 1978, three uniformed police officers in a rural area of Buckinghamshire observed a huge object, which they described as a size of a football field, which suddenly and silently materialized in front of them in the blink of an eye and at relative close proximity to their position.
→ {"text": "另一次在1978年10月，三名制服警察在白金漢郡（Buckinghamshire）的鄉村地區觀察到一個巨大的物體，他們描述其大小相當於一個足球場，它在眨眼之間突然無聲地出現在他們面前，距離他們的位置相當近。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

255. However, there were also a number of smaller objects flying around the large main object akin to a mothership kind of scenario, and the larger object then projected a beam down to the ground, which was the width of the football field, which then traversed the ground as if scanning the terrain for several minutes.
→ {"text": "然而，還有許多較小的物體在這個大型主體周圍飛行，類似母艦的場景，而這個較大的物體隨後向地面投射出一道寬度相當於足球場的光束，然後在地面上移動，彷彿在掃描地形，持續了幾分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

256. They watched this event for approximately five minutes before suddenly it went off and then dematerialized in the blink of an eye.
→ {"text": "他們觀察這個事件大約五分鐘，然後它突然消失，在眨眼間就非物質化了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

257. One second it was there, and then it was gone.
→ {"text": "前一秒它還在那裡，下一秒就消失了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

258. This has been described as like switching on a light bulb on and off, not something that I think our stealth capability is quite capable of yet.
→ {"text": "這被描述為像開關燈泡一樣，我認為這不是我們目前的匿蹤技術所能做到的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

259. The source of that report is the Police Constable Eric Raymond, retired of the Thames Valley Police.
→ {"text": "這份報告的來源是泰晤士河谷警察（Thames Valley Police）的退休警員埃里克·雷蒙德（Eric Raymond）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

260. Many officers have seen objects that appear to move in ways that seem to defy our laws of known physics and aerodynamics.
→ {"text": "許多警察看到的物體，其移動方式似乎違反了我們已知的物理定律和空氣動力學。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

261. For example, in May 1981 and 1982, two firearms officers were involved in the close protection of what was then a very prominent conservative minister in a rural location in North Yorkshire.
→ {"text": "例如，在1981年和1982年5月，兩名武裝警察在北約克郡（North Yorkshire）的鄉村地點負責當時一位非常知名的保守黨部長的近身保護工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

262. At approximately 5.30 hours in the morning, as they were walking in the grounds of this residence, they suddenly became aware that the sunshine had darkened, the sky had darkened.
→ {"text": "大約在早上5點30分，當他們在這處住所的庭園中行走時，突然意識到陽光變暗了，天空變暗了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

263. And they looked up to establish the cause of that.
→ {"text": "於是他們抬頭想要查明原因。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

264. They were amazed to see a huge, dark, purple, cylindrical object with a pronounced undercarriage underneath it that was described as being the length of a football field, a common figure in all of this, and hovering silently above the house at an altitude of only two to three hundred feet, which is extremely close.
→ {"text": "他們驚訝地看到一個巨大、深色、紫色的圓柱形物體，底部有明顯的起落架，被描述為長度相當於一個足球場——這是這些案例中常見的尺寸參照——並且無聲地懸浮在房屋上方，高度僅約200到300英呎，這是非常接近的距離。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

265. The object remained motionless, silent above the house for five to ten minutes before it suddenly and silently accelerated in the blink of an eye out to the horizon, where it stopped in an instant for a few seconds and then disappeared towards the horizon and out of sight.
→ {"text": "這個物體在房屋上方靜止且無聲地懸浮了5到10分鐘，然後突然在眨眼間無聲地加速飛向地平線，在那裡瞬間停頓了幾秒鐘，然後朝地平線消失，從視線中離開。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

266. The source of this report is police sergeant retired John Pawson of the North Yorkshire Police.
→ {"text": "這份報告的來源是北約克郡警察（North Yorkshire Police）的退休警官約翰·波森（John Pawson）。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

267. In my introduction, I mentioned that I would refer to police officer sightings worldwide.
→ {"text": "在我的開場白中，我提到我會提及全球警察的目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

268. And in the time permitted, I would like to draw your attention to just two particular countries where numerous police officer sightings have taken place.
→ {"text": "在允許的時間內，我想請各位注意兩個發生大量警察目擊事件的特定國家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

269. Namely, I refer to the United States and Belgium.
→ {"text": "也就是美國和比利時。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

270. Many of the U.S. cases are simply outstanding, and I will highlight just two of them.
→ {"text": "許多美國案例確實非常突出，我將重點介紹其中兩起。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

271. Just after midnight on the 14th of December 1994, fifteen police officers of Trumbull County, Ohio, observed multiple circular UFOs from different geographical positions.
→ {"text": "1994年12月14日午夜過後不久，俄亥俄州杜倫巴爾郡（Trumbull County）的15名警察從不同的地理位置觀察到多個圓形不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

272. In one particular sighting, the engine of the police vehicle driven by Sergeant Toby Mollero suddenly cut out.
→ {"text": "在一次特定的目擊事件中，由警官托比·莫勒羅（Toby Mollero）駕駛的警車引擎突然熄火。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

273. When he got out of the vehicle, he looked up and a UFO was directly above him shining a beam down.
→ {"text": "當他下車時，他抬頭看到一個不明飛行物就在他正上方，向下照射著一道光束。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

274. As soon as the object moved away, his engine restarted and he attempted a short pursuit.
→ {"text": "當這個物體移開後，他的引擎立即重新啟動，他嘗試進行短暫的追逐。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

275. On the 5th of January 2000 in Illinois, multiple police officers observed a large triangular craft that was witnessed from many geographical positions and were sometimes seen at close proximity to their ground locations.
→ {"text": "2000年1月5日在伊利諾州（Illinois），多名警察觀察到一個大型三角形飛行器，從許多不同的地理位置目擊到，有時在非常接近他們地面位置的地方被看到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

276. Broadly speaking, all the officers involved in both of these incidents described crafts that moved in silence which were able to make incredibly high speed maneuvers unlike that of any known aircraft.
→ {"text": "廣義來說，參與這兩起事件的所有警察都描述了無聲移動的飛行器，能夠進行任何已知飛機都無法做到的超高速機動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

277. Finally, in the skies above Belgium between 1989 and 1991, hundreds of police officers observed large triangular objects all over the country.
→ {"text": "最後，在1989年至1991年間，比利時上空有數百名警察在全國各地觀察到大型三角形物體。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

278. Many of these sightings involved multiple police officer witnesses and were frequently seen at close proximity to their ground locations.
→ {"text": "這些目擊事件中有許多涉及多名警察證人，並且經常在非常接近他們地面位置的地方被看到。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

279. In addition, many of these sightings were confirmed on multiple civilian radar and multiple military radar facilities.
→ {"text": "此外，許多這些目擊事件在多個民用雷達和多個軍用雷達設施上得到確認。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

280. In the allotted ten minutes given to brief you, which I'm trying to keep to, I would like to say on behalf of police officers worldwide that they are seeing actual structured craft, physical in nature and which move in ways that they have never seen before or since.
→ {"text": "在分配給我的十分鐘簡報時間內——我正努力遵守這個時限——我想代表全球警察說，他們看到的是真實的結構化飛行器，具有物理性質，並且以他們從未見過的方式移動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

281. In closing, I urge this panel to accept their collective testimonies as genuine and that they offer compelling circumstantial evidence that many of these sightings represent extraordinary, unknown structured craft moving in the Earth's airspace.
→ {"text": "最後，我敦促這個委員會接受他們的集體證詞是真實的，這些證詞提供了令人信服的旁證，證明許多這些目擊事件代表著在地球大氣層中移動的非凡、未知的結構化飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

282. In closing and on a personal note, I believe that the time is now to lift the veil of secrecy that has shrouded this subject for over 60 years and the subject of UFOs should now be openly accepted in the mainstream media as being real in nature and which in turn would allow people to come forward from all walks, all life, all countries without the fear of ridicule and a risk to their careers.
→ {"text": "在結束時，就個人而言，我相信現在是時候揭開籠罩這個主題超過60年的保密面紗，主流媒體應該公開承認不明飛行物的真實性，這樣才能讓來自各行各業、各種生活背景、各個國家的人們能夠挺身而出，而不必擔心遭到嘲笑和職業風險。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

283. As a police detective of many years' service, I believe that the collective testimonial documentary and physical evidence obtained in over 60 years of UFO research overwhelmingly confirms that some, and I repeat the word some, UFO sightings do represent an ongoing extraterrestrial engagement with planet Earth.
→ {"text": "作為一名服務多年的警探，我相信在超過60年的不明飛行物研究中獲得的集體證詞、文獻和物理證據，壓倒性地證實了某些——我重複這個詞，某些——不明飛行物目擊事件確實代表著與地球持續進行的外星接觸。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

284. I am deeply honoured to be here before you today and thank you, the panel, for being courageous in coming forward at probably some cost to yourselves in your reputation, but you are and whether the mainstream media are here or not, this is historic and it will be looked back as an historic event and you will be congratulated in time for your participation.
→ {"text": "我深感榮幸今天能在各位面前作證，並感謝委員會的各位勇敢地站出來，儘管這可能會對你們的聲譽造成一些代價，但無論主流媒體是否在場，這都是歷史性的，將來會被視為歷史性事件，你們的參與終將獲得讚賞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

285. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

286. Thank you very much, investigative detective, I just want to underscore that your passion really underscores the significance of your testimony and that's a worthy, it's a virtue.
→ {"text": "非常感謝您，刑事警探，我只想強調，您的熱情確實彰顯了您證詞的重要性，這是值得讚賞的，是一種美德。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

287. Now we come to our last panelist for this round, who's graced us with her, she doesn't have her little hat today, but...
→ {"text": "現在我們請出本輪最後一位證人，她今天沒有戴她的小帽子，但是……", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

288. It's not raining.
→ {"text": "今天沒下雨。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

289. It's not, okay.
→ {"text": "沒有，好的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

290. It's not raining.
→ {"text": "沒有下雨。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

291. Very good.
