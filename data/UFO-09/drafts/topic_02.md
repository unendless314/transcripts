190. The following year I met and chatted briefly with Larry Warren, the former United States Air Force security police officer, who had completely on his own, and to a degree at great risk, certainly to his peace of mind and character, become the whistleblower in this case, was directly responsible for the FOIA that resulted in the release of Colonel Halt's January 1981 report, which was then published in England in '83 and the story broke.
→ {"text": "隔年我遇到並短暫交談了賴瑞·華倫（Larry Warren），這位前美國空軍安全警察，他完全憑一己之力，並在某種程度上冒著極大風險，當然是對他的內心平靜和品格的風險，成為此案的吹哨者，他直接促成了資訊自由法申請，導致霍爾特上校（Colonel Halt）1981年1月報告的公開，該報告隨後於1983年在英國發布，故事因此爆發。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

204. It cost me to a great degree my peace of mind.

207. It was immediately in the library of the then new Prime Minister Tony Blair, one of our greatest champions in the United Kingdom, became former Admiral of the Fleet, former Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense, Lord Peter Hill Norton, who as an MP brought his hardcover copy onto the book of the floor of House of Lords and confronted the then Secretary for Defense with four questions taken right out of the book, all of which were demured, when my co-author lost his passport, the State Department refusing to renew it for "speaking out on sensitive defense issues in a public forum on foreign soil."
→ {"text": "它立即被放入當時的新首相東尼·布萊爾（Tony Blair）的圖書館，我們在英國最偉大的支持者之一，成為前海軍元帥、前國防部參謀長彼得·希爾·諾頓勳爵（Lord Peter Hill Norton），他作為國會議員將精裝本帶到上議院議場，用書中直接摘錄的四個問題質問當時的國防大臣，所有問題都被迴避，當我的合著者失去護照時，國務院拒絕續發，理由是「在外國土地上的公共論壇上談論敏感的國防問題」。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

208. It was nobody less than former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who pro bono helped us restore Larry's passport and continue our work.
→ {"text": "正是前司法部長拉姆齊·克拉克（Ramsey Clark），他無償協助我們恢復賴瑞的護照並繼續我們的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "我讚揚約翰（John）和吉姆（Jim）為這件事的真相浮出水面而奮鬥。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

212. I think all of these men are still struggling, and in fact, we are all clear in former deputy base commanders Charles Halt's terminology that these men were meddled with, and in some cases are still sorting out implanted memories from actual ones.
→ {"text": "我認為所有這些人仍在掙扎，事實上，用前副基地指揮官查爾斯·霍爾特（Charles Halt）的術語來說，我們都很清楚，這些人被「干預過」，在某些情況下仍在區分植入的記憶和真實的記憶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}
