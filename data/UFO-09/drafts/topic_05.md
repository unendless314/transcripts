## Speaker Group 1

386. Thank you very much and thank you all very much for your testimony.
→ {"text": "非常感謝各位，也非常感謝各位的證詞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

387. Mr. Heseltine, you mentioned some concern expressed to you about the contribution of statistics.
→ {"text": "海絲汀先生，您提到有人向您表達過對統計數據貢獻的疑慮。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

388. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

389. It reminded me when I was working on my doctorate, and that was a long time ago.
→ {"text": "這讓我想起當年攻讀博士學位的時候，那已經是很久以前的事了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

390. I got it in 1952.
→ {"text": "我在1952年取得學位。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

391. I came in one morning and my major professor, Norman Phillips, said, "You know, Roscoe, there are three degrees of liars."
→ {"text": "有天早上我走進研究室，我的指導教授諾曼·菲利普斯說：「你知道嗎，羅斯科，說謊者有三種程度。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

392. I said, "Sir?"
→ {"text": "我說：「先生？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

393. He said, "Yes, there are liars, there are damn liars, and there are statisticians."
→ {"text": "他說：「是的，有說謊者、有該死的說謊者，還有統計學家。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

394. So that was his view of the problem.
→ {"text": "這就是他對這個問題的看法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

395. When I got home last night, my wife called me and she said, "There's somebody on the phone with a very heavy accent that wants to talk to you."
→ {"text": "昨晚我回到家時，我太太打電話給我說：「有人打電話來找你，口音很重。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

396. So I went to the phone and it was somebody from the BBC.
→ {"text": "於是我接了電話，是BBC的人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

397. They said, "We understand that you're involved in a citizen's hearing in Washington, D.C. about extraterrestrials."
→ {"text": "他們說：「我們了解您正在華盛頓特區參與一場關於外星人的公民聽證會。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

398. I said, "Well, that's not quite my perception when I accepted the invitation to come to be a part of this citizen hearing."
→ {"text": "我說：「嗯，當我接受邀請來參加這場公民聽證會時，我的理解並不完全是這樣。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

399. I thought to myself, "This is a bit like the elephant and the three blind men."
→ {"text": "我心想：「這有點像盲人摸象的故事。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

400. One of them felt its broad side and said, "Gee, this is a wall."
→ {"text": "其中一個人摸到象的側面，說：「哇，這是一堵牆。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

401. Another felt one of the legs and said, "This has to be a tree," and another felt the tail and said, "This is a rope or a vine."
→ {"text": "另一個人摸到象腿，說：「這一定是一棵樹」，還有一個人摸到象尾巴，說：「這是一條繩子或藤蔓。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

402. And so what you think these hearings are about depends, I guess, upon your context of your experience and what you had in your head when you came here.
→ {"text": "所以，我想，你認為這場聽證會是關於什麼，取決於你的經驗背景以及你來到這裡時心中的想法。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

403. I knew before I came here that UFOs were a real subject, unidentified flying objects.
→ {"text": "在我來到這裡之前，我就知道不明飛行物是一個真實的主題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

404. Even the Air Force in their not very truthful fact sheet on closing down Project Blue Book admitted that there were 701 unidentified, that's what a UFO is, unidentified flying objects.
→ {"text": "即使是空軍在關閉藍皮書計畫時發布的那份不太誠實的事實說明書中，也承認有701個無法識別的案例，這就是UFO的定義——不明飛行物。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

405. Even the Air Force admits that there are unidentified flying objects.
→ {"text": "連空軍都承認有不明飛行物的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

406. My interview on the BBC last evening ended with my question, "What are they?"
→ {"text": "昨晚我在BBC的訪談以我的提問作結：「它們到底是什麼？」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

407. There's clearly something out there that cannot be explained as beams of light or swamp gas or hallucinations or anything.
→ {"text": "顯然有某種東西存在，無法用光束、沼澤氣體、幻覺或任何其他理由來解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

408. When more than one person sees it from different angles, when there is a radar track, this is real.
→ {"text": "當不止一個人從不同角度看到它，當有雷達追蹤記錄時，這就是真實的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

409. It's not something that you can argue away.
→ {"text": "這不是你能辯駁掉的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

410. My hope is, as a result of this hearing, that the media will, even if they believe that this is all crazy, that everyone who believes in, now I believe in UFOs.
→ {"text": "我希望這場聽證會的結果是，媒體即使認為這一切都很瘋狂，但每個相信的人——現在我相信不明飛行物的存在。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

411. I'm not quite there yet that they're extraterrestrial.
→ {"text": "但我還沒有完全確信它們是外星的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

412. Maybe that's because I'm a scientist and I know that the closest possible place I'm told where there could be life is 37 light years away.
→ {"text": "也許是因為我是科學家，我知道據告知可能存在生命的最近地點距離我們37光年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

413. What that means is unless they have some way of communicating faster than the speed of light it takes 74 years to ask a question and get an answer back.
→ {"text": "這意味著除非他們有某種超越光速的通訊方式，否則提出一個問題並得到回答需要74年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

414. So obviously you can't be controlling something from that far away.
→ {"text": "所以顯然你無法從那麼遠的地方控制任何東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

415. Now, my forbearers, not very long ago since I am Anglo-Saxon, my forbearers not very long ago were running around Europe in animal skins in a stone age.
→ {"text": "現在，我的祖先，由於我是盎格魯撒克遜人，我的祖先在不久以前還在歐洲披著獸皮，處於石器時代。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

416. So I have to be pretty arrogant and presumptuous to believe that there isn't somewhere out there in this huge universe some civilization more developed than mine.
→ {"text": "所以我必須非常傲慢和自以為是，才會相信在這個廣闊的宇宙中沒有任何比我們更先進的文明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

417. And I note that we still have these stupid wars and kill each other and there's got to be a civilization somewhere in this huge universe with a billion stars in our galaxy and a billion galaxies out there.
→ {"text": "我注意到我們仍然在進行這些愚蠢的戰爭，互相殘殺，而在這個擁有數十億恆星的銀河系以及外面數十億個星系的巨大宇宙中，一定存在某個文明。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

418. The statistical probability that there is life somewhere else just has to be very, very high, doesn't it?
→ {"text": "某處存在生命的統計概率一定非常、非常高，不是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

419. I would hope that what comes of this hearing is that the press recognizes that here is an opportunity for some really interesting stories.
→ {"text": "我希望這場聽證會的成果是，媒體能夠認識到這裡有一些非常有趣的報導機會。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

420. There is reporting out there and then after the reporting what is the explanation of it?
→ {"text": "有報導在那裡，然後在報導之後，對此的解釋是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

421. I'm sure the Air Force thought that they could explain away nearly 12,000, 12,618 sightings.
→ {"text": "我確信空軍認為他們可以解釋掉將近12,000個，也就是12,618個目擊事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

422. They explained away all but 701 of them.
→ {"text": "他們解釋掉了除了701個之外的所有案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

423. And there are a lot of sightings that are searchlights on clouds and that sort of thing.
→ {"text": "確實有很多目擊事件是雲層上的探照燈之類的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

424. So it would make very interesting press I would think to report these sightings and then to report the analysis of the sighting.
→ {"text": "所以我認為報導這些目擊事件，然後報導對目擊事件的分析，會是非常有趣的新聞。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

425. What did it mean?
→ {"text": "它意味著什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

426. So the press doesn't have to buy in to extraterrestrials, they don't have to buy into any of this.
→ {"text": "所以媒體不必接受外星人的說法，他們不必接受任何這些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

427. They simply need to do what the press I think is supposed to do and that is report what's out there.
→ {"text": "他們只需要做我認為媒體應該做的事，那就是報導正在發生的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

428. And why wouldn't this make, you know, and they don't have to buy into the lunatic fringe, you know, if somebody cites something, somebody cites something, why not report it?
→ {"text": "為什麼這不會成為，你知道，他們不必接受極端瘋狂的說法，你知道，如果有人引述某事，有人引述某事，為什麼不報導呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

429. They don't even report the sighting.
→ {"text": "他們甚至連目擊事件都不報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

430. They don't report anything.
→ {"text": "他們什麼都不報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

431. You know, you've told me about fairly recent sightings, I haven't heard any of that in the press.
→ {"text": "你知道，你告訴我一些相當近期的目擊事件，我在媒體上完全沒有聽說過。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

432. Now, a number of years ago there were mentions of that in the press.
→ {"text": "現在，許多年前媒體還有提到過這些。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

433. I mentioned the one time I was listening, I can't remember the year, it was quite some time ago, but you may be able to tell me what the year was by the confluence of the two events.
→ {"text": "我提到有一次我在聽，我記不清是哪一年了，那已經是很久以前的事了，但你也許能從這兩個事件的同時發生來告訴我是哪一年。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

434. One was sightings over New Mexico and the other was a report that two people had died in New York City from what might have been psittacosis, and if it was psittacosis it might have come from dried pigeon manures, so maybe we ought to kill all the pigeons in New York City.
→ {"text": "一個是新墨西哥州上空的目擊事件，另一個是紐約市有兩人死於可能是鸚鵡熱的報導，如果是鸚鵡熱，可能來自乾燥的鴿糞，所以也許我們應該殺光紐約市所有的鴿子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

435. So I thought to myself, you know, with that kind of logic, if I was out there from somewhere else watching us, I think I'd want to watch a little longer before I contacted these people.
→ {"text": "所以我心想，你知道，用那種邏輯，如果我是從其他地方來到這裡觀察我們的，我想我會想再觀察久一點才去接觸這些人。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

436. I hope that that's what comes of this.
→ {"text": "我希望這就是這場聽證會的成果。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

437. As I say, you know, there are unidentified flying objects.
→ {"text": "如我所說，你知道，不明飛行物是存在的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

438. I came here with an open mind.
→ {"text": "我帶著開放的心態來到這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

439. I'm not quite there yet that they're extraterrestrial because I'm not sure how they would control things when the closest possible life, I'm told, is 37 light years away.
→ {"text": "我還沒有完全確信它們是外星的，因為我不確定當據告知最近可能存在生命的地方距離37光年時，它們如何控制這些東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

440. Now, you know, I couldn't imagine, my forebears couldn't imagine of the iPhones of today, so clearly there may be travel faster than the speed of light.
→ {"text": "現在，你知道，我無法想像，我的祖先也無法想像今天的iPhone，所以顯然可能存在超光速旅行。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

441. There may be ways to communicate that we can't begin to understand, but, you know, the phenomenon is real.
→ {"text": "可能存在我們無法開始理解的通訊方式，但是，你知道，這個現象是真實的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

442. They are here.
→ {"text": "它們在這裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

443. There are thousands of reportings, you know, and I will do everything I can.
→ {"text": "有成千上萬的報告，你知道，我會盡我所能。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

444. I think I have some credibility.
→ {"text": "我想我有一些可信度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

445. I will try to do everything I can to convince the press that they -- there's some interesting stories here.
→ {"text": "我會盡力去說服媒體，他們——這裡有一些有趣的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

446. You know, the story may be this guy's really a wacko, isn't he?
→ {"text": "你知道，故事可能是這個人真的是個瘋子，不是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

447. He's reporting these crazy things.
→ {"text": "他在報告這些瘋狂的事情。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

448. In any event, isn't there an interesting story to all of these sightings?
→ {"text": "無論如何，所有這些目擊事件難道不是一個有趣的故事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

449. There is something there.
→ {"text": "那裡有某種東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

450. Why -- who has been successful in convincing the press that these are not reportable?
→ {"text": "為什麼——誰成功地說服了媒體這些不值得報導？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

451. Supposed to be a free press, free country, the truth out there.
→ {"text": "應該是自由媒體、自由國家，真相就在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

452. Why isn't it?
→ {"text": "為什麼不是呢？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

453. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "非常感謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

454. It's turning into a Senate hearing, you know, where we give our views, and of course, I'm guilty of that for the last two days.
→ {"text": "這變成了參議院聽證會了，你知道，我們在那裡發表我們的觀點，當然，過去兩天我也犯了這個毛病。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

455. The next person to ask questions is Congresswoman Lynn Wolsey.
→ {"text": "下一位提問的是林恩·沃爾西眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

456. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

457. More interesting information.
→ {"text": "更多有趣的資訊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

458. There's no question about it.
→ {"text": "這毫無疑問。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

459. I'd like to just add on to what Congressman Bartlett said.
→ {"text": "我想補充一下巴特利特眾議員所說的話。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

460. It's not just the press that needs to start bringing this forward.
→ {"text": "不僅僅是媒體需要開始推動這件事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

461. It's our government, and we know that.
→ {"text": "是我們的政府，我們知道這一點。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

462. Maybe if our government will listen and investigate -- I mean, they're doing it somewhere probably, but if they'd bring it out in the open, that would make interesting press, and it would not be press libeled kooks, I don't believe.
→ {"text": "也許如果我們的政府願意傾聽和調查——我的意思是，他們可能在某處正在做這件事，但如果他們公開進行，那會成為有趣的新聞，而且我不相信媒體會誹謗他們是瘋子。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

463. And I actually have questions, but I want to say, there's no kooks in this room, and I am so impressed with all of you, so thank you for letting me be part of it.
→ {"text": "我確實有問題要問，但我想說，這個房間裡沒有瘋子，我對你們所有人都印象深刻，所以感謝你們讓我參與其中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

464. Okay, Peter Davenport, you said that there's over 80,000 written reports and examples that you get, I mean, reports you get every year on your hotline and in your organization?
→ {"text": "好的，彼得·達文波特，你說你們有超過80,000份書面報告和案例，我是說，你們每年通過熱線和組織收到的報告？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

465. We receive probably between 3,000 and 6,000 reports a year.
→ {"text": "我們每年大概收到3,000到6,000份報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

466. We have, I think, 86,000 reports accumulated in our database.
→ {"text": "我想我們的資料庫中累積了86,000份報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

467. Okay, well, give us an example or two of what somebody would call about that actually resulted in incredible action.
→ {"text": "好的，那麼給我們一兩個例子，說明有人打電話報告什麼事情，實際上導致了令人難以置信的行動。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

468. Thank you for the question, Congresswoman Woolsey.
→ {"text": "謝謝您的提問，沃爾西眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

469. I would go right to the Phoenix Lights case in response to your question, the most dramatic case that I've handled in my roughly 50, 60 years of investigating the UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "針對您的問題，我會直接提到鳳凰城光點事件，這是我在大約50、60年的UFO現象調查中處理過的最戲劇性的案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

470. Again, the size of the objects was unimaginable by terrestrial standards.
→ {"text": "再次強調，這些物體的大小以地球標準來說是難以想像的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

471. The triangular object that hovered for an estimated five minutes over the intersection of 7th Avenue and Indian School Road that night, again, this is March 13th, 1997, hovered there for five minutes.
→ {"text": "那天晚上，三角形物體在第七大道和印第安學校路的交叉口上空懸停了估計五分鐘，再次強調，這是1997年3月13日，它在那裡懸停了五分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

472. It subtended an arc of about 135 degrees from the vantage point of people on the ground.
→ {"text": "從地面人們的視角來看，它張開了大約135度的弧度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

473. It was that large above their heads, at which time it was not less than 8,000 feet above ground level.
→ {"text": "它在他們頭頂上就是那麼大，當時它距離地面不少於8,000英呎。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

474. The size of these objects by itself tells us that we're dealing with something extraordinary.
→ {"text": "這些物體的大小本身就告訴我們，我們正在處理某種非凡的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

475. That object was capable of hovering motionless for five minutes.
→ {"text": "那個物體能夠靜止懸停五分鐘。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

476. So I'm going to ask you to talk about what came of that.
→ {"text": "所以我要請你談談那之後發生了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

477. So you discovered, you heard something, of something and it turned out to be something that people could see and what came of it?
→ {"text": "所以你發現了，你聽說了某件事，結果它是人們能看到的東西，那之後發生了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

478. So why did it matter that we knew this?
→ {"text": "那麼為什麼我們知道這件事很重要？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

479. Well it appears that a very unusual event occurred.
→ {"text": "嗯，似乎發生了一個非常不尋常的事件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

480. It's generated multiple books, six videotapes of various objects that night were taken.
→ {"text": "它催生了多本書籍，那天晚上拍攝了六段不同物體的錄影帶。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

481. It was an extraordinary event that went largely unreported in the national press.
→ {"text": "這是一個非凡的事件，但在全國性媒體中基本上沒有報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

482. It occurred on March 13th.
→ {"text": "它發生在3月13日。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

483. The first national article in the USA Today did not appear until Wednesday the 18th of June that year.
→ {"text": "《今日美國報》的第一篇全國性報導直到那年6月18日星期三才出現。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

484. Was anybody harmed?
→ {"text": "有人受傷嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

485. Did anything happen to Arizona because of this?
→ {"text": "亞利桑那州因此發生了什麼事嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

486. Not that I'm aware of.
→ {"text": "據我所知沒有。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

487. I think the full story is yet to be understood and I'm not sure we'll be able to obtain the full story.
→ {"text": "我認為完整的故事還有待理解，我不確定我們能否獲得完整的故事。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

488. But about 1,500 witnesses submitted written reports.
→ {"text": "但大約有1,500名目擊者提交了書面報告。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

489. That's pretty good evidence by my standard.
→ {"text": "以我的標準來看，這是相當好的證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

490. What did you do with those reports?
→ {"text": "你對這些報告做了什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

491. Where did they go?
→ {"text": "它們去了哪裡？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

492. Many of them are on our webpage.
→ {"text": "其中許多都在我們的網頁上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

493. I think probably 100 or 150 eyewitness reports are posted there.
→ {"text": "我想大概有100或150份目擊者報告發布在那裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

494. Many of them are in the hands of investigators in Arizona.
→ {"text": "其中許多在亞利桑那州調查員的手中。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

495. Thank you.
→ {"text": "謝謝。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

496. Are you still following up?
→ {"text": "你還在跟進嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

497. You don't just hand it to the investigators and say now it's yours?
→ {"text": "你不是只是把它交給調查員然後說現在是你們的了？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

498. Well that is what I did in that instance because the National UFO Reporting Center technically speaking is not an investigative body.
→ {"text": "嗯，那就是我在那個情況下所做的，因為國家UFO報告中心從技術上講並不是一個調查機構。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

499. We're a conduit of information.
→ {"text": "我們是資訊的管道。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

500. Now to all of you, but you don't all have to answer if you hear the right answer from one of your colleagues on the panel.
→ {"text": "現在問所有人，但如果你從小組中的某位同事那裡聽到了正確的答案，你們不必全部回答。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

501. When it's not a UFO, this flying object, when it's not a UFO, what is it?
→ {"text": "當它不是UFO時，這個飛行物體，當它不是UFO時，它是什麼？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

502. I'll take that first.
→ {"text": "我先來回答這個問題。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

503. Any number of things Congresswoman.
→ {"text": "可能是很多東西，眾議員女士。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

504. In fact most of us who try to do good work in this field are approached with surprising skepticism because we no longer have the luxury of disbelief so to say.
→ {"text": "事實上，我們這些試圖在這個領域做好工作的人，都是帶著令人驚訝的懷疑態度來看待的，因為可以說我們已經不再有不相信的奢侈了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

505. It's been proved to us repeatedly in terms you could bring into a courtroom.
→ {"text": "它已經以你可以帶進法庭的方式一再向我們證明了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

506. We have to be particularly careful about not informing our examination.
→ {"text": "我們必須特別小心，不要讓先入為主的觀念影響我們的檢驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

507. It's no secret that our government has produced flying aircraft that do not conform to the notions that we grew up with that are terribly advanced and I don't have to tell the members of this committee that technologically where we are at the highest levels.
→ {"text": "我們的政府已經製造出不符合我們成長時期觀念的飛行器，這些飛行器極其先進，這不是什麼秘密，我也不必告訴委員會成員我們在技術上處於最高水平。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

508. So now and it's your understanding that those technologies aren't common knowledge?
→ {"text": "那麼現在，你的理解是這些技術不是常識嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

509. Oh I think they're common knowledge in popular culture but the specifics of the dynamics of these machines and what they're capable of for most intelligent people would mimic a machine from another planet or something.
→ {"text": "哦，我認為它們在流行文化中是常識，但對於大多數聰明人來說，這些機器的動力學細節以及它們的能力會模仿來自另一個星球的機器或類似的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

510. Also if you're predisposed to the subject or you're a believer or you're looking for these things, it can be a plane coming at a certain angle, it can under certain circumstances be a reflection from the ground, it can be a large assembly of balloons themselves that escape.
→ {"text": "另外，如果你對這個主題有先入為主的看法，或者你是信徒，或者你正在尋找這些東西，它可能是以某個角度飛來的飛機，在某些情況下可能是地面的反射，可能是一大群逃逸的氣球組合。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

511. There are any number of possibilities.
→ {"text": "有無數種可能性。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

512. The main thing is to paraphrase our friend and colleague Stanton Friedman, the question is not are UFOs per se machines of advanced technology from parts unknown.
→ {"text": "主要的是，套用我們的朋友和同事斯坦頓·弗里德曼的話，問題不在於UFO本身是否是來自未知地方的先進技術機器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

566. And the answer was never.

765. Mr. Davenport, you indicated you received about 86,000 incidents, I guess, over the years, about 3,000 to 5,000 a year.
→ {"text": "達文波特先生，你說你這些年來收到了大約86,000個事件，我想，每年大約3,000到5,000個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

766. Your list here of 62, and I appreciate that you went back to 1936 on the first one, and I noticed that probably 55 or more are more recent, probably in the last 15 or 16 years.
→ {"text": "你這裡的62個清單，我很感激你第一個追溯到1936年，我注意到可能55個或更多是更近期的，可能在過去15或16年內。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

767. I take it this might be a top 62 hit list or something of incidents that you think.
→ {"text": "我認為這可能是前62名的熱門清單或你認為的事件之類的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

768. So what I'm really asking is, what was the standard that you used for including these, and they are certainly interesting, events and sightings.
→ {"text": "所以我真正想問的是，你用什麼標準來包括這些，它們當然是有趣的事件和目擊。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

769. Thank you for the question, Congressman Cook.
→ {"text": "謝謝你的提問，庫克眾議員。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

770. There were several criteria, the drama involved with the sighting, the degree of corroboration, the degree of verification, but in essence, I drew up that list as a distillation from the 86,000 cases for the committee's benefit to show you some of the more dramatic, well-founded cases that we have in our database.
→ {"text": "有幾個標準，目擊事件涉及的戲劇性、佐證程度、驗證程度，但本質上，我從86,000個案例中提煉出那份清單，以便委員會了解我們資料庫中一些更戲劇性、有充分依據的案例。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

771. And you, like others that have studied this, would probably say that a high percentage of the 86,000 that you've received are probably not credible.
→ {"text": "而你，像其他研究過這個的人一樣，可能會說你收到的86,000個案例中有很高比例可能是不可信的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

772. I mean, it doesn't take a very high percentage to make a really important case here, so I'm trying to get a sense of what you think would be a credible percentage of all those numbers.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，不需要很高的百分比就能在這裡提出一個非常重要的案例，所以我試圖了解你認為在所有這些數字中有多少百分比是可信的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

773. It's very difficult to quantify that.
→ {"text": "這很難量化。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

774. I've attempted to do it, but the difficulty is, it is very difficult to know for sure with 100 percent accuracy what is a genuine UFO sighting and what is not.
→ {"text": "我曾嘗試這樣做，但困難在於，很難以100%的準確性確定什麼是真正的UFO目擊，什麼不是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

775. Well, I think you've put together some very good work on sightings of UFOs.
→ {"text": "嗯，我認為你對UFO目擊事件做了一些非常好的工作。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

776. So I'm going to jump to the next thing, and until I saw the last statement, I was sort of accepting this, but I have to say, and it's not too different than the concern that I think Congressman Bartlett expressed earlier.
→ {"text": "所以我要跳到下一個問題，在我看到最後的陳述之前，我有點接受這個，但我必須說，這與我認為巴特利特眾議員早些時候表達的擔憂沒有太大不同。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

777. You said here at the back, without indicating ET aspects of these sightings -- now, maybe there are some that you just didn't include in this list, but it's a fact that we have -- that this is ET, that ET is real, and I'm just asking you, how -- well, let me ask you this.
→ {"text": "你在後面說，沒有指出這些目擊事件的外星方面——現在，也許有一些你只是沒有包括在這個清單中，但我們擁有的事實是——這是外星的，外星是真實的，我只是問你，如何——嗯，讓我問你這個。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

778. Isn't it a leap to say, okay, UFOs exist as Dr. -- well, Dr. Bartlett has indicated, and then saying it's ET.
→ {"text": "說好的，UFO存在，正如博士——嗯，巴特利特博士所指出的，然後說它是外星的，這不是一個跳躍嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

779. I mean, aren't there other explanations for UFOs?
→ {"text": "我的意思是，對於UFO難道沒有其他解釋嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

780. Are there no other explanations?
→ {"text": "沒有其他解釋嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

781. Is it the only explanation?
→ {"text": "這是唯一的解釋嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

782. That's what I'm asking.
→ {"text": "這就是我要問的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

783. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

784. Probably not the only explanation.
→ {"text": "可能不是唯一的解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

785. I have to say that because we don't have a definitive answer yet to what we're dealing with, but it is difficult for me to imagine that some of the craft and some of the circumstances that are reported to our center are of terrestrial origin, just given the flight characteristics of many of the craft reported to us.
→ {"text": "我必須這麼說，因為我們還沒有對我們正在處理的事情有明確的答案，但考慮到向我們報告的許多飛行器的飛行特性，我很難想像向我們中心報告的一些飛行器和一些情況是來自地球的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

786. In other words, probably in these 62 cases, you would say it's the best explanation.
→ {"text": "換句話說，可能在這62個案例中，你會說這是最好的解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

787. Is that what you're saying?
→ {"text": "這是你在說的嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

788. And is that why they get included on the list, if you think it's the best explanation for ET?
→ {"text": "這就是為什麼它們被列入清單，如果你認為這是外星的最佳解釋？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

789. Or you're just saying, hey, there was credibility.
→ {"text": "還是你只是說，嘿，有可信度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

790. We don't know what it was yet, but clearly they saw something.
→ {"text": "我們還不知道它是什麼，但顯然他們看到了什麼。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

791. It's very strange.
→ {"text": "這非常奇怪。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

792. I mean, you have some ET index that you're applying to this list.
→ {"text": "我的意思是，你有一些外星指數應用於這個清單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

793. I take it?
→ {"text": "我這樣理解嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

794. Or you wouldn't said that at the end?
→ {"text": "否則你不會在最後說那個？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

795. Yeah.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

796. I would not have included those cases in that list had they not been of extreme interest to me.
→ {"text": "如果這些案例對我沒有極大的興趣，我不會把它們列入那份清單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

797. I am a scientist trained in that capacity, and I would not have included those cases in that list had they not had associated with them good, solid, hard objective evidence.
→ {"text": "我是在這方面受過訓練的科學家，如果這些案例沒有與之相關的良好、堅實、硬性客觀證據，我不會把它們列入那份清單。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

798. As part of your scientific training, you are saying here that it's still a leap between a belief in a UFO and knowing without a doubt that it's ET.
→ {"text": "作為你科學訓練的一部分，你在這裡說，相信UFO和毫無疑問地知道它是外星的之間仍然是一個跳躍。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

799. I would say more-- You said yes?
→ {"text": "我會說更多——你說是嗎？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

800. I would say more-- Well, you said, yeah, but I want to make sure I hear this correct.
→ {"text": "我會說更多——嗯，你說是的，但我想確保我聽得正確。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

801. And really, I want you to say what you truthfully believe and think based on your experience.
→ {"text": "真的，我想讓你根據你的經驗說出你真正相信和認為的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

802. Clearly you've had a lot of time to think about this a lot, and you are obviously an impressively trained scientist.
→ {"text": "顯然你有很多時間思考這個問題，而且你顯然是一位訓練有素的科學家。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

803. I would characterize it not so much as a leap as a step in that direction, and if these craft are not of extraterrestrial origin, I have no explanation for them.
→ {"text": "我會把它描述為朝那個方向邁出的一步，而不是跳躍，如果這些飛行器不是外星起源的，我對它們沒有解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

804. Craft that can hover motionless for five minutes above Phoenix, craft that can accelerate at a rate so fast that it's reported from multiple witnesses their eyes could not follow the craft as it departed.
→ {"text": "能在鳳凰城上空靜止懸停五分鐘的飛行器，能以如此快的速度加速以至於多個目擊者報告他們的眼睛無法跟隨飛行器離開的飛行器。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

805. I understand the maneuvering that you're saying, and it's certainly the best maybe, in your mind, the best explanation.
→ {"text": "我理解你所說的操縱，這當然可能是，在你心中，最好的解釋。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

806. I'd like to go to Gary Heseltine, I have to say that I'm particularly impressed with your list of sightings, and the reason I'm impressed is because they're from policemen, every one of these.
→ {"text": "我想請蓋瑞·海絲汀發言，我必須說我對你的目擊清單特別印象深刻，我印象深刻的原因是因為它們都來自警察，每一個都是。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

807. This is a pretty thick list, a lot of them, so I imagine the credibility on your list you would rank as certainly higher than what many people that collect data would indicate.
→ {"text": "這是一份相當厚的清單，有很多，所以我想像你清單上的可信度你會評為肯定比許多收集數據的人所表示的要高。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

808. I don't want to put any words in your mouth.
→ {"text": "我不想把話塞進你嘴裡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

809. No, you've actually highlighted something that I hope to be able to answer, and I think the real answer is that when I said to you before that the accepted figure is three percent after investigation, well that's not really the end of it because I would argue that in the high caliber witness categories, high caliber I would mean astronauts, cosmonauts, pilots, military and commercial, radar operators, sonar operators, in these very high caliber witness categories, the percentage after investigation would be much, much higher than that three percent.
→ {"text": "不，你實際上突顯了我希望能夠回答的東西，我認為真正的答案是，當我之前對你說調查後公認的數字是3%時，嗯，這並不是真正的終點，因為我會爭辯說，在高水準證人類別中，高水準我指的是太空人、宇航員、飛行員、軍事和商業、雷達操作員、聲納操作員，在這些非常高水準的證人類別中，調查後的百分比會比那3%高得多。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

810. I would hazard a guess that if you looked at military pilots with millions of dollars spent on their training, the percentage of error would be much reduced, and I would hazard a guess that it would be something in the region of 80 percent plus were accurate.
→ {"text": "我大膽猜測，如果你看看在訓練上花費數百萬美元的軍事飛行員，錯誤率會大大降低，我大膽猜測，大約80%以上是準確的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

811. Okay, then I'm going to quickly ask you, well I'm not going to ask you because I only have a minute left, but I'm going to say certainly credibility of people like Captain Solace who's sitting here in the front row, that probably caused the United States Air Force to come up with filters over their ICBM silos is certainly going to be a credible experience in the UFO.
→ {"text": "好的，那麼我要快速問你，嗯我不會問你因為我只剩一分鐘了，但我要說的是，像坐在前排的索拉斯上尉這樣的人的可信度，這可能導致美國空軍在他們的ICBM發射井上安裝過濾器，這肯定會是UFO方面的可信經驗。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

812. Well, I think that's where we need to look at when we look at collective evidence.
→ {"text": "嗯，我認為這就是我們看集體證據時需要關注的地方。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

813. I'm sorry to catch you, but I know that we're trying, I'm going to ask Ms. Howe, very interesting slides, very interesting, Nevada Proving Ground, Dagway, Utah, I'm from Utah, talk about secrets, let's talk about nuclear testing secrets, could nuclear testing have a lot to do with these animal carcasses and the bloodless?
→ {"text": "對不起打斷你，但我知道我們正在努力，我要問豪女士，非常有趣的幻燈片，非常有趣，內華達試驗場、猶他州達格威，我來自猶他州，談談秘密，讓我們談談核試驗秘密，核試驗是否與這些動物屍體和失血有很大關係？", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

816. Okay, good answer.
→ {"text": "好的，好答案。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

817. Let me ask you this though, the one thing that maybe I scratched my head on a little bit for a statement, well, I scratch my head on a lot, I'll have to say that, that it absolutely is evidence of genetic harvesting.
→ {"text": "讓我問你這個，有一件事讓我對一個陳述有點困惑，嗯，我對很多事情都感到困惑，我必須說，這絕對是基因收穫的證據。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

818. I mean, that may be your belief, that may be something that you...

820. No, it's not a belief.

825. That has to be...

826. You're saying that's proof, absolute 100% proof, to the extent that the law of gravity is pretty much proven.
→ {"text": "你是說這是證據，絕對100%的證據，就像重力定律幾乎已被證明的程度。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

827. The next round of the hearing is documents, and there have been leaked documents from inside our own government, in which the phrase extraterrestrial biological entities, with the acronym, all caps, E-B-E-S, has been included since at least a printing of what I think is a document that none of us have found any dispute over, the SOM 101 document with a 1954 war office stamp on it.

828. If our government, going back to FDR, which there were also leaked documents about the discussion between FDR and the Secretary of War, Marshall, after February 1942, made the front page of the Los Angeles Times, the photograph of our artillery and beams going up to a diamond shaped object, distributing some 1,417 bullets, and then having that discussed in documents by Franklin Delano Roosevelt with the Secretary of War, and that in those documents that had been leaked, it uses the terms, these were interplanetary, celestial, and that we were retrieving these craft because we wanted to examine them.

829. That puts a context here, again, that would be before the war.

830. Well, I appreciate you're telling me that that's interesting to me, but you don't allow any of the wiggle room that, for example, Mr. Davenport seems to allow in terms of final conclusions, and that's certainly your right, because you've looked at these things a lot more than I have.
