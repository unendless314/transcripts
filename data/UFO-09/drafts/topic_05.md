## Speaker Group 1

386. Thank you very much and thank you all very much for your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

387. Mr. Heseltine, you mentioned some concern expressed to you about the contribution of statistics.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

388. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

389. It reminded me when I was working on my doctorate, and that was a long time ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

390. I got it in 1952.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

391. I came in one morning and my major professor, Norman Phillips, said, "You know, Roscoe, there are three degrees of liars."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

392. I said, "Sir?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

393. He said, "Yes, there are liars, there are damn liars, and there are statisticians."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

394. So that was his view of the problem.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

395. When I got home last night, my wife called me and she said, "There's somebody on the phone with a very heavy accent that wants to talk to you."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

396. So I went to the phone and it was somebody from the BBC.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

397. They said, "We understand that you're involved in a citizen's hearing in Washington, D.C. about extraterrestrials."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

398. I said, "Well, that's not quite my perception when I accepted the invitation to come to be a part of this citizen hearing."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

399. I thought to myself, "This is a bit like the elephant and the three blind men."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

400. One of them felt its broad side and said, "Gee, this is a wall."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

401. Another felt one of the legs and said, "This has to be a tree," and another felt the tail and said, "This is a rope or a vine."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

402. And so what you think these hearings are about depends, I guess, upon your context of your experience and what you had in your head when you came here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

403. I knew before I came here that UFOs were a real subject, unidentified flying objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

404. Even the Air Force in their not very truthful fact sheet on closing down Project Blue Book admitted that there were 701 unidentified, that's what a UFO is, unidentified flying objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

405. Even the Air Force admits that there are unidentified flying objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

406. My interview on the BBC last evening ended with my question, "What are they?"
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

407. There's clearly something out there that cannot be explained as beams of light or swamp gas or hallucinations or anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

408. When more than one person sees it from different angles, when there is a radar track, this is real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

409. It's not something that you can argue away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

410. My hope is, as a result of this hearing, that the media will, even if they believe that this is all crazy, that everyone who believes in, now I believe in UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

411. I'm not quite there yet that they're extraterrestrial.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

412. Maybe that's because I'm a scientist and I know that the closest possible place I'm told where there could be life is 37 light years away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

413. What that means is unless they have some way of communicating faster than the speed of light it takes 74 years to ask a question and get an answer back.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

414. So obviously you can't be controlling something from that far away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

415. Now, my forbearers, not very long ago since I am Anglo-Saxon, my forbearers not very long ago were running around Europe in animal skins in a stone age.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

416. So I have to be pretty arrogant and presumptuous to believe that there isn't somewhere out there in this huge universe some civilization more developed than mine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

417. And I note that we still have these stupid wars and kill each other and there's got to be a civilization somewhere in this huge universe with a billion stars in our galaxy and a billion galaxies out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

418. The statistical probability that there is life somewhere else just has to be very, very high, doesn't it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

419. I would hope that what comes of this hearing is that the press recognizes that here is an opportunity for some really interesting stories.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

420. There is reporting out there and then after the reporting what is the explanation of it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

421. I'm sure the Air Force thought that they could explain away nearly 12,000, 12,618 sightings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

422. They explained away all but 701 of them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

423. And there are a lot of sightings that are searchlights on clouds and that sort of thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

424. So it would make very interesting press I would think to report these sightings and then to report the analysis of the sighting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

425. What did it mean?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

426. So the press doesn't have to buy in to extraterrestrials, they don't have to buy into any of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

427. They simply need to do what the press I think is supposed to do and that is report what's out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

428. And why wouldn't this make, you know, and they don't have to buy into the lunatic fringe, you know, if somebody cites something, somebody cites something, why not report it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

429. They don't even report the sighting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

430. They don't report anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

431. You know, you've told me about fairly recent sightings, I haven't heard any of that in the press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

432. Now, a number of years ago there were mentions of that in the press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

433. I mentioned the one time I was listening, I can't remember the year, it was quite some time ago, but you may be able to tell me what the year was by the confluence of the two events.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

434. One was sightings over New Mexico and the other was a report that two people had died in New York City from what might have been psittacosis, and if it was psittacosis it might have come from dried pigeon manures, so maybe we ought to kill all the pigeons in New York City.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

435. So I thought to myself, you know, with that kind of logic, if I was out there from somewhere else watching us, I think I'd want to watch a little longer before I contacted these people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

436. I hope that that's what comes of this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

437. As I say, you know, there are unidentified flying objects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

438. I came here with an open mind.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

439. I'm not quite there yet that they're extraterrestrial because I'm not sure how they would control things when the closest possible life, I'm told, is 37 light years away.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

440. Now, you know, I couldn't imagine, my forebears couldn't imagine of the iPhones of today, so clearly there may be travel faster than the speed of light.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

441. There may be ways to communicate that we can't begin to understand, but, you know, the phenomenon is real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

442. They are here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

443. There are thousands of reportings, you know, and I will do everything I can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

444. I think I have some credibility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

445. I will try to do everything I can to convince the press that they -- there's some interesting stories here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

446. You know, the story may be this guy's really a wacko, isn't he?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

447. He's reporting these crazy things.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

448. In any event, isn't there an interesting story to all of these sightings?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

449. There is something there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

450. Why -- who has been successful in convincing the press that these are not reportable?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

451. Supposed to be a free press, free country, the truth out there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

452. Why isn't it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

453. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

454. It's turning into a Senate hearing, you know, where we give our views, and of course, I'm guilty of that for the last two days.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

455. The next person to ask questions is Congresswoman Lynn Wolsey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

456. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

457. More interesting information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

458. There's no question about it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

459. I'd like to just add on to what Congressman Bartlett said.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

460. It's not just the press that needs to start bringing this forward.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

461. It's our government, and we know that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

462. Maybe if our government will listen and investigate -- I mean, they're doing it somewhere probably, but if they'd bring it out in the open, that would make interesting press, and it would not be press libeled kooks, I don't believe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

463. And I actually have questions, but I want to say, there's no kooks in this room, and I am so impressed with all of you, so thank you for letting me be part of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

464. Okay, Peter Davenport, you said that there's over 80,000 written reports and examples that you get, I mean, reports you get every year on your hotline and in your organization?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

465. We receive probably between 3,000 and 6,000 reports a year.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

466. We have, I think, 86,000 reports accumulated in our database.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

467. Okay, well, give us an example or two of what somebody would call about that actually resulted in incredible action.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

468. Thank you for the question, Congresswoman Woolsey.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

469. I would go right to the Phoenix Lights case in response to your question, the most dramatic case that I've handled in my roughly 50, 60 years of investigating the UFO phenomenon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

470. Again, the size of the objects was unimaginable by terrestrial standards.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

471. The triangular object that hovered for an estimated five minutes over the intersection of 7th Avenue and Indian School Road that night, again, this is March 13th, 1997, hovered there for five minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

472. It subtended an arc of about 135 degrees from the vantage point of people on the ground.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

473. It was that large above their heads, at which time it was not less than 8,000 feet above ground level.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

474. The size of these objects by itself tells us that we're dealing with something extraordinary.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

475. That object was capable of hovering motionless for five minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

476. So I'm going to ask you to talk about what came of that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

477. So you discovered, you heard something, of something and it turned out to be something that people could see and what came of it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

478. So why did it matter that we knew this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

479. Well it appears that a very unusual event occurred.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

480. It's generated multiple books, six videotapes of various objects that night were taken.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

481. It was an extraordinary event that went largely unreported in the national press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

482. It occurred on March 13th.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

483. The first national article in the USA Today did not appear until Wednesday the 18th of June that year.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

484. Was anybody harmed?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

485. Did anything happen to Arizona because of this?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

486. Not that I'm aware of.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

487. I think the full story is yet to be understood and I'm not sure we'll be able to obtain the full story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

488. But about 1,500 witnesses submitted written reports.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

489. That's pretty good evidence by my standard.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

490. What did you do with those reports?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

491. Where did they go?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

492. Many of them are on our webpage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

493. I think probably 100 or 150 eyewitness reports are posted there.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

494. Many of them are in the hands of investigators in Arizona.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

495. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

496. Are you still following up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

497. You don't just hand it to the investigators and say now it's yours?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

498. Well that is what I did in that instance because the National UFO Reporting Center technically speaking is not an investigative body.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

499. We're a conduit of information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

500. Now to all of you, but you don't all have to answer if you hear the right answer from one of your colleagues on the panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

501. When it's not a UFO, this flying object, when it's not a UFO, what is it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

502. I'll take that first.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

503. Any number of things Congresswoman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

504. In fact most of us who try to do good work in this field are approached with surprising skepticism because we no longer have the luxury of disbelief so to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

505. It's been proved to us repeatedly in terms you could bring into a courtroom.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

506. We have to be particularly careful about not informing our examination.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

507. It's no secret that our government has produced flying aircraft that do not conform to the notions that we grew up with that are terribly advanced and I don't have to tell the members of this committee that technologically where we are at the highest levels.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

508. So now and it's your understanding that those technologies aren't common knowledge?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

509. Oh I think they're common knowledge in popular culture but the specifics of the dynamics of these machines and what they're capable of for most intelligent people would mimic a machine from another planet or something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

510. Also if you're predisposed to the subject or you're a believer or you're looking for these things, it can be a plane coming at a certain angle, it can under certain circumstances be a reflection from the ground, it can be a large assembly of balloons themselves that escape.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

511. There are any number of possibilities.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

512. The main thing is to paraphrase our friend and colleague Stanton Friedman, the question is not are UFOs per se machines of advanced technology from parts unknown.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

513. The question is has one ever been and for those of us that spend a good part of our lives looking into these questions, that answer is overwhelmingly yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

514. And we feel pretty certain that the UFOs and if they're manned or bodied, I don't know what's in them if there is such a thing, they are coming here with, they aren't coming to get our technology, they're coming with advanced technology, they're that far ahead of us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

515. Well I don't think any of us assume these things run on coal, petroleum, or.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

516. Yeah right, okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

517. What it is is all theoretical.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

518. I have been involved in this field of study for over 35 years and I know that I have no idea of where they come from, why they're coming, how they propel themselves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

519. I can make better educated guesses than many people and I tend to shy away from colleagues who do tell me that they know the specific answers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

520. For me that is somewhat problematical to say that you know the unknown definitively.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

521. There's only several ways you can.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

522. They told you, you read it in a book, you saw it in a movie, you dreamt it, it came to you in a vision, however my feeling is we are dealing with an area that is the epitome of the unknown.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

523. Okay I have one more question and I have to ask Linda because I only have a minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

524. Miss Moulton-Howe, explain a little bit further, I don't understand how these pieces and parts of the tissues are used, a genetic harvest, it's a genetic harvest.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

525. To be used how?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

526. I'm not there yet, I don't get it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

527. What are they doing with it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

528. They're going to take it back to outer space and do something, what are they doing with it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

529. I think that the answer is very complicated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

530. I think it involves on a more sophisticated level what we are beginning to do in our science with cloning and if you are advanced and you can take genetic material and you can clone, you can probably clone anything.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

531. So there is a chance, there is maybe the idea that we have parts of animals, parts of living animals that the aliens would like to clone because they are maybe stronger than what they have or why do they want ours?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

532. I don't have all the answers but genetic, a harvest of tissue, there might be a reason for why specific pieces and tissues are harvested, not because anything is being done with the bovine itself, it's the genetic DNA, it's the DNA that would be used.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

533. So it's not a religious sacrament or it's not symbolic?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

534. We're talking about medical cloning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

535. Could I just come in there to back up Linda there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

536. I think we have to put things in perspective and it goes back to addressing the question in your last question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

537. Realistically, every UFO researcher in the world will say of 100% of cases, 95% of them turn out to have a mundane explanation, that's a generally accepted figure worldwide.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

538. Have a mundane, whether it be astronomical misinterpretation, that's a generally accepted figure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

539. But really where we start to delve down is when we look at the 5%, well when you look at the 5% after investigation you end up with probably about 3% of hardcore cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

540. Now these are hardcore cases after investigation, well I am bothered about the 97% and your remit here is not really to speculate in my opinion as to where and what they're doing, it's really to establish the facts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

541. And the facts are very, very apparent from very credible people that we are demonstrating that this is a subject that needs to be addressed on an evidential basis.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

542. And it's not for us to speculate really where they're coming from, what their agenda is, it's really to look at the evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

543. This is a hearing to look at evidence and this is what we should be doing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

544. And the evidence in that 3% is what counts and the media really need to look at the 3%, the cases that defy all explanation after investigation, that's what evidence is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

545. Is there evidence that would stand up in a court of law?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

546. Yes there is.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

547. If there was a plain crash scenario just outside this building and we all happened to be on a coffee break, we'd all be material witnesses to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

548. However, when we talk about UFOs, the media suddenly make us all crazy.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

549. And that is wrong and this needs to be addressed and the panel in front of me are the representatives that can help make that happen.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

550. We are relying on you to use your voice and experience to listen to the evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

551. And all any UFO investigator wants, all we want is a level playing field, that is not a lot to ask in the world, we just want to present evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

552. But sir, are you suggesting we listen and don't ask questions?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

553. No, of course not, but in the limited timeframe that we have, we have only so little time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

554. If we don't ask the mundane, simple question that the public is asking, you aren't going to get anything out of this panel.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

555. No, I accept that, but we're here to look at evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

556. But the evidence goes to implication and that's what you're asking about.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

557. And the implication of all of this is most of the world is probably at the stage of pretty lights in the sky that form patterns or can be stationary and put beams down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

558. And what I just presented to you in a brief way was just a tiny, tiny scratch on the surface of 33 years of my trying to understand animal mutilations and why, which goes out to a thousand other branches.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

559. If the pretty lights in the sky and the beams for centuries have been involved with harvesting material from this earth, I don't know that there's any homo sapien who can answer why.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

560. But there is no question in my mind or anybody who has investigated that we're dealing with advanced intelligences, with advanced technology that can fold space time, sir, that's how it's faster than the speed of light and that in so doing that their focus is on what we as homo sapiens have only begun to investigate and that is the DNA, the genetic material and that we're now finally doing experiments in the subject of cloning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

561. It's a bottom line that what is happening on this planet and it has for centuries is there is a harvest of genetic material, plants, animals and humans.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

562. Why and to what end is a very complicated story.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

563. And I think that what I had just realized and you're asking me the question which goes to implication is that the disconnect between the current world population of seven billion and what is actually happening on this planet in relationship to other intelligences, the gap is so great that to address the details that are known and what our government knows is so difficult that right now the inertia of silence on the part of government agencies who have a great deal of information, let me guarantee you, that they feel that this is a subject that cannot be presented.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

564. And I do know that there was a high ranking naval officer who told one of his lower ranking officers who had seen a craft who was exposed to the photographs from Roswell of the bodies.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

565. The high ranking authority when asked by the low ranking authority who had seen the craft and asked the higher ranking, when are you going to tell the people?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

566. And the answer was never.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

567. And the implication there politically is that we are now in the United States of America where there is an unstated policy of total complete silence for the foreseeable future because it is too difficult to change what has been known to something that might upend a lot of subjects.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

568. I would like to turn it now to Congressman Carolyn Kilpatrick, please.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

569. That will be Congresswoman, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

570. Yes, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

571. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

572. I am easily corrected.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

573. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

574. Not to correct you, just woman here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

575. I certainly want to appreciate and thank you all for coming again.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

576. Every day is a different day.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

577. This is the first day of the rest of all of our lives.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

578. How we use it, how we put it together, how we share and give back is what we are here for.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

579. So I commend you for your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

580. A lot of notes, a lot of work and my mind is boggled.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

581. I think I want to ask you first, Mr. Hazelton, Royal Air Force, security, police, hundreds of incidents yet today, what is the position of the British government on UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

582. And is it similar to US who are cousins or is it something different or do we do this in British?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

583. Do they speak?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

584. Tell me what is the position there?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

585. The bottom line is that there is the special relationship with America and America is quite clearly the most secretive government in the world on UFOs and it leads, their fingers are in every decent UFO report around the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

586. I want to know about Britain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

587. Okay, well Britain follows generally America's lead on most things and Britain does the same.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

588. They have been releasing over the last three and a half years several batches of files which are in terms of papers, hundreds of thousands of single sheets of paper.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

589. However, the majority of the paper that has been released is very low level, it's mostly correspondence and amongst that there are some very good cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

590. For example, a British case in 1957, Milton Torres, a pilot, US pilot flying over Ipswich in Suffolk, England and he was stationed there flying a super saber.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

591. He was vectored towards a radar target and he was ordered to fire his missile at the target.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

592. He actually got the launch codes when he went to launch, it jammed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

593. Okay, stop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

594. Okay, in Britain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

595. Stop, yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

596. You don't give me cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

597. We got cases.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

598. Okay.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

599. I want to know what's happening in Britain.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

600. I want to know what's happening in the military.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

601. Britain is very lame.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

602. I want to know what's happening on top of the government.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

603. The media is very similar to the US in not reporting, it belittles the subject and it's criminal and there is very little or no difference in the UK to the US.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

604. This is a world phenomenon that we're discussing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

605. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

606. You all know it way better than we do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

607. Absolutely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

608. We've heard testimony now three days and read a month leading up to this, videos and all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

609. Miss Howe.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

610. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

611. And it's really for all of you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

612. And I think you ended your presentation on something like this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

613. What and why is such a profound reality.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

614. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

615. Not being built upon, internalized.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

616. If I have my military who comes to me and tells me they've got data, experiences and other kinds of things that this is real, other countries I've been on elevator and in the hotels with others from Chile and Peru and everywhere else in the world or many places in the world, when we already acknowledge that whatever it is is more significant than what we have here and obviously in Britain and some of the other countries, the why of it, your scientific data is outstanding.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

617. I think the answer is probably in a coalition of nations and not in our governments.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

618. Obviously because the governments know something we don't know and they aren't sharing it and it could be critical and catastrophic for the human being.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

619. Well, let me add a post script to yesterday's presentation on vent waters.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

620. It's a major case that involved dozens of military people on a very important base.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

621. I for one at least have been exposed to information from two people that within 24 hours of the Jim Peniston, John Burroughs and Ed Kvansack encounter with the black glassy craft with the hieroglyphic symbols on it in the forest that within 24 hours in the UK, the National Security Agency of the United States took over everything that was happening at Van Water.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

622. They testified to that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

623. This is important because it means that within 24 hours a decision had been made somewhere at some level between the United States and the UK that the United States would take precedent through the National Security Agency.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

624. Okay, stop.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

625. We heard that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

626. No, am I good?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

627. I don't know the scientific part.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

628. I'm just going to tell you the political and what we do and what things we know about our country and the world and our relationships with very countries of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

629. You got to teach us something else.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

630. Wait.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

631. Let me just finish my point because don't give me that testimony we had yesterday.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

632. We all heard it, we got notes and we got to read it and embellish it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

633. I want to move it to the action phase.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

634. You came here to ask us to do something and we got to know how, what and why.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

635. Haven't got there yet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

636. Maybe by Friday or next month or as we move this over the next couple of years we'll get closer than you got in 30 years and you have to be commended.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

637. What you have unveiled is something is there that we're not alone.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

638. I'm still learning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

639. I want to learn more about that, in fact.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

640. But as I learn it, the existence as we know it is being jeopardized and may not exist next week, let alone 30 more years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

641. I was only going to your point about international versus the United States.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

642. It's my impression that the United States for some reason politically is carrying the weight of the disclosure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

643. I don't know why because other countries have bodies, have craft, have photographs, have physical evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

644. But the United States going back to World War II and decisions that were made for some reason it is this country that seems to have the pivotal weight in the disclosure.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

645. What do you think that is?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

646. What do you think that is?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

647. U.S. is the, if it's not for real, it's perceived to be the power of the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

648. And that's exactly the reason why it's not for real.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

649. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

650. Right.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

651. So we sit here in the power of the world, but the power not of this world or we don't know how it fits.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

652. Do you think America wants to lose that power?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

653. Hold it, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

654. Hold it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

655. Hold it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

656. Hold it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

657. Hold it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

658. You can't interrupt a congressperson.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

659. I will yield to you in a moment, though.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

660. I will because I just want to, we just, we want to get to what we need to get to really and how we get to make it something so that we can all live another hundred years or thereabouts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

661. So I'm going to yield to you, Mr. Heseltine, in just a second.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

662. And you too.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

663. I don't want to, I'm just getting antsy up here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

664. Today you all took it to, every day it's another level, woo, woo, but I hate how we trivialize this situation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

665. Exactly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

666. I hate the men with the horns and all that and what my colleague read yesterday.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

667. And that's been since day one.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

668. And I'm telling you, what we know, it's so profound and so big and so real when you don't know how to deal with it, you trivialize it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

669. So when people think that we're coming, you all have been combining us, we've all taken a lot of flak and we're proud of it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

670. We're servants of the people.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

671. But to come here and then hear this other crap in my home paper as well, I don't even talk to them because you can't say conspiracy if you're a congressman because they really think you're wacko.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

672. But there's something out here that's been coordinated from our leadership, not the president person, but the office and our military and our press that's a national conglomeration that continues.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

673. And unless we can somehow step outside of that and build some kind of coalitions and work and pray and build and speak and teach, we're going to lose.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

674. And what will the world be?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

675. It might be those things that have been drawn for all of my life.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

676. I yield to Mr. Heseltine rest of my time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

677. May I make a suggestion?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

678. You all as witnessed on Monday, the very what I thought it was an historic moment at the end when you were concluded, summing up the first day where you all said no, we should have congressional hearings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

679. Now for a ufologist, that's an amazing thing for you to say.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

680. And I appreciate that tremendously.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

681. But I think what I need you to do realistically as people with over 80 years experience is to say that to NBC, CNN.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

682. So ring up your colleagues at 6 o'clock today and say I'm calling a press conference collectively where all six of you say we believe in you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

683. Do you think that the press, listen, we talked to the press for 10 minutes, 30 minutes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

684. They take the 10 seconds that they want.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

685. That's why it's got to be a people to people thing.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

686. It's not going to be from the press.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

687. I know that, but we battle the press and that is the principal reason why nobody knows this subject.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

688. We're in the press club.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

689. Have you seen the article in any of these posts?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

690. Precisely.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

691. But why aren't they here?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

692. They're here.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

693. They are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

694. Can I just add momentarily on to my colleague's thoughts?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

695. It's not so much that you're saying something on the record about your reevaluation of this subject based on the knowledge that you're acquiring here and in your readings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

696. It's the cumulative effect of all of you and the people now serving in your positions that will make the change, but it must begin somewhere with people taking a stand like your good selves.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

697. We believe it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

698. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

699. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

700. I'd like to call on Congresswoman Darlene Hooley, Congresswoman.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

701. Thank you Mr. Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

702. Thank you all of you for your testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

703. It's been terrific.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

704. When did we start sort of this whole ridicule piece?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

705. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

706. May I take that?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

707. Yes, Peter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

708. It has become a research specialty of mine and it begins literally the summer of 1947.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

709. For me, I began questioning this over 20 years ago.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

710. How is it that my saying to you, Congresswoman, I saw something in the sky the other day or the other night that I couldn't recognize or did something that I had never seen, case closed, why is it that in terms of 66 years of Western journalism, popular culture, attitudes and ideas about flying saucers and little green men that you hear me make a simple observation and you're wired to think, gee, I didn't know Peter had mental problems or maybe he's kind of gone mystical or he wants to feel special or he wants to perpetrate a hoax or he wants to be on the Oprah show or in the words of the late Dr. Wilhelm Reich, evasion of the obvious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

711. Why is it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

712. How did that happen?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

713. It wasn't an accident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

714. I spent years studying that first wave of media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

715. I'm the only person you've ever met that has downloaded and read in order every single article the New York Times has ever published on the subject of UFOs, extraterrestrials, flying disks, et cetera, in order repeatedly looking for a pattern of reportage.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

716. And it begins the week after the Roswell incident.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

717. The Times didn't even deem it worthwhile to make that first report when it was reported that a machine of undetermined origin had crashed outside of this town in New Mexico.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

718. They waited until the cover story had gone into effect.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

719. And I would say, as a non-statistician, 98% of the New York Times coverage, and I stress here that in 1947, even more than now, the New York Times was the flagship of Western journalism.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

720. It still is in print terms.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

721. The influence the Times exerted over the other news syndicates was marked.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

722. The Copley Syndicate, Hearst Papers, all of the major American papers followed the Times lead as a rule, and the Times hit the floor with all four wheels spinning.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

723. Every coverage, and I will be happy to send you an unpublished paper on this if you're curious.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

724. Anybody on the committee was sarcastic, condescending, ridiculing, explaining away like a parent to a bad child.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

725. Almost immediately they start to trot out authorities, often unnamed, often very contemptuous of the subject because overwhelmingly they're astronomers and psychologists.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

726. You would actually laugh if you read some of these articles.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

727. They're breathtaking in their ignorance and pseudo-science.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

728. Now what I did was I overlaid on that timeline of these articles several hundred authentic, fully vetted, declassified documents from every agency you can imagine.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

729. I would say it's about a 95% rate as you go through these where you see these silly headlines and phenomenally goofy excuses, and then you see Air Force, starting in September of '47, Air Force intelligence, Army intelligence, CIA, et cetera.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

730. We are concerned these are not Soviet.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

731. They may be extraterrestrials.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

732. By the way, two words at the time in 1947 and so on.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

733. What happened was it was drummed into the minds of editors, reporters that this is the way this thing is reported.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

734. Now again I stress these are the nationals.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

735. The locals, as Peter said, have almost always had an inquiring mind and acted independently actually searching for information.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

736. I cannot prove, I couldn't offer you a shred of real evidence of why I think this is and how it happened, but deductive reasoning, a lot of study and common sense suggest to me that a number of key individuals in the Truman administration, either with the understanding of the president or not to preserve plausible liability, either with the coordination of the study group that had formed around the president in 1947 or not, went to New York, to Boston, to Los Angeles to meet with people like David Sarnoff of NBC, the owners of The Times, the Hearst people, and one of several things passed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

737. They basically said we're a little concerned based on that old bugaboo of Orson Welles in 1938, mass panic, you know everybody's worried about the Russians right now.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

738. The president would consider it a personal favor if you kind of toe the line on this and just treat it not seriously or in some cases possibly saying, because these were major players, these folks were power brokers and among the most influential people in the country at the time, that we need your assistance, it's your patriotic duty.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

739. Now once that pattern was set into place, what reporter that picks up on the reality of this and wants to do a serious piece of reportage is going to risk their career?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

740. We all know it's a joke.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

741. Now to a great degree, that pattern is still stuck in the major media.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

742. It is changing, but that, I believe, is how it began.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

743. And one of, thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

744. I think I have one minute left, anyone that would like to tackle this question.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

745. We've got a problem time-wise, a serious problem time-wise.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

746. I yield back my one minute.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

747. Thank you very much.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

748. And I would ask my colleague.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

749. I hope you make that up somewhere.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

750. Yes, oh yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

751. You know where we're going to make it up?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

752. We're not going to eat today, if we keep it up.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

753. We're going to have the food of knowledge, but not much more.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

754. I'd like to ask my colleague if he could restrict his time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

755. I'm going to wipe my time out because we've been liberal in letting the witnesses express themselves and that's of course why we're here, for you to express yourself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

756. But here too, since this doesn't work, maybe this works.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

757. When you see me doing that, wind it down intelligently.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

758. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

759. And just a brief close to what he was saying, and that is that one year after the July 47 crashes, there was another one in Aztec, New Mexico in March of 1948.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

760. And the editor of the Farmington newspaper at the time did receive, from all that we have been able to learn, did receive a request by somebody in the Pentagon to not report about what had happened, that there was distinct pressure put on to a local editor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

761. And I believe that that is the way that the Defense Department and local media, that was shortly after World War II, and so the population was less and the local media were much, much more inclined to take some requests by the Pentagon.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

762. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

763. I now yield to Congressman Mike Cook, Mayor Cook, I'm sorry.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

764. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

765. Mr. Davenport, you indicated you received about 86,000 incidents, I guess, over the years, about 3,000 to 5,000 a year.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

766. Your list here of 62, and I appreciate that you went back to 1936 on the first one, and I noticed that probably 55 or more are more recent, probably in the last 15 or 16 years.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

767. I take it this might be a top 62 hit list or something of incidents that you think.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

768. So what I'm really asking is, what was the standard that you used for including these, and they are certainly interesting, events and sightings.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

769. Thank you for the question, Congressman Cook.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

770. There were several criteria, the drama involved with the sighting, the degree of corroboration, the degree of verification, but in essence, I drew up that list as a distillation from the 86,000 cases for the committee's benefit to show you some of the more dramatic, well-founded cases that we have in our database.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

771. And you, like others that have studied this, would probably say that a high percentage of the 86,000 that you've received are probably not credible.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

772. I mean, it doesn't take a very high percentage to make a really important case here, so I'm trying to get a sense of what you think would be a credible percentage of all those numbers.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

773. It's very difficult to quantify that.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

774. I've attempted to do it, but the difficulty is, it is very difficult to know for sure with 100 percent accuracy what is a genuine UFO sighting and what is not.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

775. Well, I think you've put together some very good work on sightings of UFOs.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

776. So I'm going to jump to the next thing, and until I saw the last statement, I was sort of accepting this, but I have to say, and it's not too different than the concern that I think Congressman Bartlett expressed earlier.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

777. You said here at the back, without indicating ET aspects of these sightings -- now, maybe there are some that you just didn't include in this list, but it's a fact that we have -- that this is ET, that ET is real, and I'm just asking you, how -- well, let me ask you this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

778. Isn't it a leap to say, okay, UFOs exist as Dr. -- well, Dr. Bartlett has indicated, and then saying it's ET.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

779. I mean, aren't there other explanations for UFOs?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

780. Are there no other explanations?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

781. Is it the only explanation?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

782. That's what I'm asking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

783. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

784. Probably not the only explanation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

785. I have to say that because we don't have a definitive answer yet to what we're dealing with, but it is difficult for me to imagine that some of the craft and some of the circumstances that are reported to our center are of terrestrial origin, just given the flight characteristics of many of the craft reported to us.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

786. In other words, probably in these 62 cases, you would say it's the best explanation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

787. Is that what you're saying?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

788. And is that why they get included on the list, if you think it's the best explanation for ET?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

789. Or you're just saying, hey, there was credibility.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

790. We don't know what it was yet, but clearly they saw something.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

791. It's very strange.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

792. I mean, you have some ET index that you're applying to this list.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

793. I take it?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

794. Or you wouldn't said that at the end?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

795. Yeah.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

796. I would not have included those cases in that list had they not been of extreme interest to me.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

797. I am a scientist trained in that capacity, and I would not have included those cases in that list had they not had associated with them good, solid, hard objective evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

798. As part of your scientific training, you are saying here that it's still a leap between a belief in a UFO and knowing without a doubt that it's ET.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

799. I would say more-- You said yes?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

800. I would say more-- Well, you said, yeah, but I want to make sure I hear this correct.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

801. And really, I want you to say what you truthfully believe and think based on your experience.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

802. Clearly you've had a lot of time to think about this a lot, and you are obviously an impressively trained scientist.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

803. I would characterize it not so much as a leap as a step in that direction, and if these craft are not of extraterrestrial origin, I have no explanation for them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

804. Craft that can hover motionless for five minutes above Phoenix, craft that can accelerate at a rate so fast that it's reported from multiple witnesses their eyes could not follow the craft as it departed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

805. I understand the maneuvering that you're saying, and it's certainly the best maybe, in your mind, the best explanation.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

806. I'd like to go to Gary Heseltine, I have to say that I'm particularly impressed with your list of sightings, and the reason I'm impressed is because they're from policemen, every one of these.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

807. This is a pretty thick list, a lot of them, so I imagine the credibility on your list you would rank as certainly higher than what many people that collect data would indicate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

808. I don't want to put any words in your mouth.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

809. No, you've actually highlighted something that I hope to be able to answer, and I think the real answer is that when I said to you before that the accepted figure is three percent after investigation, well that's not really the end of it because I would argue that in the high caliber witness categories, high caliber I would mean astronauts, cosmonauts, pilots, military and commercial, radar operators, sonar operators, in these very high caliber witness categories, the percentage after investigation would be much, much higher than that three percent.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

810. I would hazard a guess that if you looked at military pilots with millions of dollars spent on their training, the percentage of error would be much reduced, and I would hazard a guess that it would be something in the region of 80 percent plus were accurate.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

811. Okay, then I'm going to quickly ask you, well I'm not going to ask you because I only have a minute left, but I'm going to say certainly credibility of people like Captain Solace who's sitting here in the front row, that probably caused the United States Air Force to come up with filters over their ICBM silos is certainly going to be a credible experience in the UFO.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

812. Well, I think that's where we need to look at when we look at collective evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

813. I'm sorry to catch you, but I know that we're trying, I'm going to ask Ms. Howe, very interesting slides, very interesting, Nevada Proving Ground, Dagway, Utah, I'm from Utah, talk about secrets, let's talk about nuclear testing secrets, could nuclear testing have a lot to do with these animal carcasses and the bloodless?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

814. Isn't that a...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

815. Our first test was in July of 1945, there are mutilation records going back, as I said, to 1911.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

816. Okay, good answer.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

817. Let me ask you this though, the one thing that maybe I scratched my head on a little bit for a statement, well, I scratch my head on a lot, I'll have to say that, that it absolutely is evidence of genetic harvesting.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

818. I mean, that may be your belief, that may be something that you...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

819. You say there's...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

820. No, it's not a belief.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

821. Are you saying there's no possibility it could be anything but genetic harvesting, what these slides are showing?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

822. We're not in the context of belief here at all.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

823. We're in the context of hard physical evidence, medical evidence.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

824. The purpose of how that was, how that carcass ended up the way it was, is what I'm asking.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

825. That has to be...
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

826. You're saying that's proof, absolute 100% proof, to the extent that the law of gravity is pretty much proven.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

827. The next round of the hearing is documents, and there have been leaked documents from inside our own government, in which the phrase extraterrestrial biological entities, with the acronym, all caps, E-B-E-S, has been included since at least a printing of what I think is a document that none of us have found any dispute over, the SOM 101 document with a 1954 war office stamp on it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

828. If our government, going back to FDR, which there were also leaked documents about the discussion between FDR and the Secretary of War, Marshall, after February 1942, made the front page of the Los Angeles Times, the photograph of our artillery and beams going up to a diamond shaped object, distributing some 1,417 bullets, and then having that discussed in documents by Franklin Delano Roosevelt with the Secretary of War, and that in those documents that had been leaked, it uses the terms, these were interplanetary, celestial, and that we were retrieving these craft because we wanted to examine them.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

829. That puts a context here, again, that would be before the war.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

830. Well, I appreciate you're telling me that that's interesting to me, but you don't allow any of the wiggle room that, for example, Mr. Davenport seems to allow in terms of final conclusions, and that's certainly your right, because you've looked at these things a lot more than I have.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

831. I want to get the best information I can, as credibly put together as I can, to help, as I said, break down the truth embargo.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

832. That's what we need to do first, and maybe we have to do it a brick at a time.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
