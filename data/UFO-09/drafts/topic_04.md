315. Yes.
→ {"text": "是的。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

316. And Australia has played a very interesting role in this historically because the BBC in 1979, when I started the work on A Strange Harvest, there was a producer there who told me that they had a journal from 1911 that had been published about 104 sheep being found in an Australian billabong with an ear, eye, tongue, genitals, and rectum cored out, 104 all in one billabong with no blood and no tracks around those animals either.
→ {"text": "澳洲在這個現象的歷史中扮演了非常有趣的角色，因為1979年BBC的一位製作人告訴我，當我開始製作《詭異收穫》時，他們有一本1911年出版的期刊，記載了104隻羊在澳洲的一個死水潭（billabong）被發現，耳朵、眼睛、舌頭、生殖器和直腸都被挖空，全部104隻都在同一個死水潭裡，也沒有血跡，周圍也沒有任何足跡。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "沒有人確切知道在過去半個世紀裡，美國、加拿大和世界各地有多少動物被肢解。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

321. Many mutilated animals are not reported because ranchers are either afraid or do not want public attention and potential ridicule. Image 14.

324. Excisions are not only smooth and bloodless, they can be serrated the way that pinking shears cut cloth for dressmakers, as was discovered in this two-year-old Hereford steer, the fifth mutilation on the Richard Fazio Ranch near Portland, Oregon, within a four-month period ending in October of 1990.
→ {"text": "切除不僅平滑且無血，它們還可以呈鋸齒狀，就像裁縫用的鋸齒剪刀剪布料一樣，這在這頭兩歲的赫里福德（Hereford）小公牛身上被發現，這是1990年10月結束的四個月期間內，俄勒岡州波特蘭附近理查德·法齊奧牧場（Richard Fazio Ranch）的第五起肢解案件。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

328. Here is a close-up of that particular serrated edge from the side in the 1990 Oregon steer serrated excision that an Oregon State University veterinary diagnostic laboratory reported had been cut with high heat, image 5, consistent, and I'm reading now from the Oregon State University veterinary laboratory assessment, quote, "Consistent with a specimen collected via electrosurgical excision, it is not possible to tell whether this lesion was caused by a laser.
→ {"text": "這是1990年俄勒岡小公牛鋸齒切除側面特寫，俄勒岡州立大學獸醫診斷實驗室報告這是用高溫切割的，投影片5，一致，我現在引述俄勒岡州立大學獸醫實驗室的評估：「與通過電外科切除收集的標本一致，無法判斷這個損傷是否由雷射造成。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

332. There had to have been some kind of cautery.
→ {"text": "一定有某種燒灼方式。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

333. But then I worked with John Altshuler, M.D. pathologist and hematologist in Denver, Colorado, going out to animal mutilation sites myself to collect tissue and fluid for him to study from the animals.
→ {"text": "但後來我與科羅拉多州丹佛市的病理學家和血液學家約翰·奧舒勒醫學博士合作，我親自前往動物肢解現場，從動物身上採集組織和液體供他研究。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

→ {"text": "奧舒勒博士還向我展示了肢解者切除的顯微照片，與已知的雷射手術進行比較。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

338. Dr. Altshuler said, "The animal mutilation excisions do not show any carbon, but earth life is carbon based and all tissue exposed to the heat of a laser should show carbon residue that looks like black pepper grains under a microscope."
→ {"text": "奧舒勒博士說：「動物肢解的切除沒有顯示任何碳，但地球生命是碳基的，所有暴露於雷射熱量的組織都應該顯示碳殘留，在顯微鏡下看起來像黑胡椒粒。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

339. We never found any carbon residue on mutilator excisions we studied, raising the question, what is the surgical instrument?

351. These changes are referred to as coagulative necrosis.
→ {"text": "這些變化被稱為凝固性壞死。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

352. The band between cutting margin and normal tissue is quite thin, suggesting that the dissection was done with what appears to be a pinpoint accuracy and minimal dissipation of heat at the cut line, "The heat is confined to a millimeter in these excisions."
→ {"text": "切割邊緣和正常組織之間的帶狀區域非常薄，這表明解剖是以看似精確的針尖般準確度完成的，切線處的熱量散失最小，「這些切除中的熱量被限制在一毫米內。」", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

353. Image 10.

368. But Lynn Lauber called me at KMGH TV in Denver after the broadcast of my TV documentary, A Strange Harvest, and he said that he had seen my documentary, and he was calling me because, and this is what he said to me, he knew that something from outer space was involved in the mutilations that the RCMP in Canada had investigated.
→ {"text": "但蘭·勞伯在我的電視紀錄片《詭異收穫》播出後打電話到丹佛的KMGH電視台找我，他說他看了我的紀錄片，他打電話給我是因為——這是他對我說的——他知道加拿大皇家騎警調查的肢解案件涉及來自外太空的東西。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

369. When I asked him why then have you told the media the perpetrators are satanic cults, he said the reason was that he felt the truth was too difficult to report publicly.
→ {"text": "當我問他那為什麼告訴媒體施暴者是邪教時，他說原因是他覺得真相太難以公開報導。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

370. And that to me sums up the metaphor of not just this 21st century or the 20th century, but this is a phenomena that I understand has been going on for thousands of years, and we are just catching up to it.
→ {"text": "對我來說，這總結了不僅是21世紀或20世紀的隱喻，這是一種我理解已經持續數千年的現象，我們只是剛剛趕上它。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

371. And when Sheriff Tex Graves in September of 1979 in my very first interview with somebody in law enforcement about animal mutilations when I began doing A Strange Harvest, told me, Linda, the perpetrators are creatures from outer space, quote unquote, and I felt the same shock that perhaps you do.
→ {"text": "當1979年9月，在我開始製作《詭異收穫》時第一次採訪執法人員關於動物肢解的問題時，警長特克斯·格雷夫斯（Tex Graves）告訴我：「琳達，施暴者是來自外太空的生物，」——原話如此——我感受到的震驚可能與各位現在一樣。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

372. The truth is law enforcement has long known from their own eyewitness accounts they've seen the beams of light in pastures.

→ {"text": "有人看到發光的圓盤用光束將動物降下到牧場，然後動物就被肢解了。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

376. And to get those people, law enforcement or ranchers, to stand up in front of a camera and tell the world what they've seen with their own eyes is the biggest difficulty of my entire career because we are on a planet where humans are more afraid of humans and they're ridicule than they are of extraterrestrials.
→ {"text": "要讓這些人，無論是執法人員還是牧場主，站在攝影機前告訴世界他們親眼所見，是我整個職業生涯中最大的困難，因為我們生活在一個人類更害怕人類和他們的嘲笑，勝過害怕外星人的星球上。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

377. I am hoping that in this citizen hearing, a kind of exercise to what I hope will take place.
→ {"text": "我希望這次公民聽證會是一種演練，為我希望將會發生的事情做準備。", "confidence": "high", "notes": ""}

379. They have more data than I do.
