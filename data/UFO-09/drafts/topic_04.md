## Speaker Group 1

293. Because I'm going to talk about a subject that is perhaps one of the most difficult when it comes to the UFO phenomena, I thought I would give you a little bit more context about my background and to Jennifer, who is handling the slides, please wait until I call for them by number.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

294. My name is Linda Moulton Howe, my master's degree in communication is from Stanford University, Palo Alto, California in 1968, I attached a bio for you to my statement today.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

295. Since then, I have produced two dozen TV documentaries, including the regional Emmy Award, honored a strange harvest about the worldwide animal mutilation phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

296. And more than 100 live TV studio programs, science, environment, and medicine is my beat.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

297. I also produce, write, edit, and report the journalism award winning science, environment, and real X-Files news website, earthfiles.com.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

298. In addition, I am an investigative reporter for premier radio networks program Coast to Coast AM, reporting earth files, environment, science, and real X-Files news monthly in three hour broadcasts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

299. Since 1990, I have produced a thousand new segments for radio broadcasts.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

300. My four books include An Alien Harvest, 1989, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume One, Facts and Eyewitnesses, 1993, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume Two, High Strangeness, 1998, Mysterious Lights, and Crop Circle, Second Edition, 2002.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

301. I have been asked to speak around the world as an investigative reporter at national and international conferences and symposiums, including NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

302. And one of the subjects that I have been asked to talk about is all of the work that I have done in the investigation of animal mutilations around the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

303. The first global media report about this phenomena was in September of 1967 when a female horse named Lady was found dead on a ranch near Alamosa in southern Colorado.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

304. The horse's entire skull and long neck had been stripped of flesh and every organ in the chest of that horse had been surgically excised according to a medical doctor.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

305. There was no blood anywhere, not in the animal, not around the animal, and nowhere nearby.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

306. And there were no tracks of the animal.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

307. It was powdery soil and the animal is lying there stripped of flesh, but there were no tracks around the body, not even the own horse's tracks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

308. But a hundred and some feet away there were horse tracks in a circle as if the horse had been caught in something in which the feet had gone around in a circle and then a hundred and some feet away the body was found.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

309. At that same time, and Jennifer, image 00, on July 15th, 1984, the Sunday Times in Australia headlined, quote, "Cover-up alleged over UFO-linked animal slaughter.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

310. Many reports of UFOs and strange lights in the sky," close quote, "Farmers in the Adelaide Hills have discovered mutilated animal corpses and burn marks on the ground.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

311. In one incident, researchers say a farmer discovered four cows with holes drilled into their skulls and the brains removed."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

312. Adelaide UFO researcher Colin Norris said, quote, "I have been told the Army asked the farmer to remain quiet about the animals and that the Army would cover the whole thing up," close quote.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

313. Mr. Norris said pod marks in the ground and burnt treetops indicated a UFO craft had landed.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

314. That was Australia in 1984, and we should have up that headline at 00.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

315. Yes.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

316. And Australia has played a very interesting role in this historically because the BBC in 1979, when I started the work on A Strange Harvest, there was a producer there who told me that they had a journal from 1911 that had been published about 104 sheep being found in an Australian billabong with an ear, eye, tongue, genitals, and rectum cored out, 104 all in one billabong with no blood and no tracks around those animals either.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

317. Image 13.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

318. This map shows geographic areas where animal mutilations have been reported since 1967 at least, barring the fact that Australia has reported many before.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

319. By 2013, every state in the United States and every province in Canada have had bloodless large animal mutilations as well as other countries.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

320. No one knows for certain how many animals have been mutilated over the past half century in the United States and Canada and around the world.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

321. Many mutilated animals are not reported because ranchers are either afraid or do not want public attention and potential ridicule. Image 14.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

322. Beyond the United States and Canada, mutilated animals have been reported in Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, parts of Europe, the Canary Islands, China, and Australia.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

323. Image 1.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

324. Excisions are not only smooth and bloodless, they can be serrated the way that pinking shears cut cloth for dressmakers, as was discovered in this two-year-old Hereford steer, the fifth mutilation on the Richard Fazio Ranch near Portland, Oregon, within a four-month period ending in October of 1990.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

325. Image 2.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

326. Here is a photograph of the uniformly serrated edge of the mutilator's bloodless excision that many people who have had these in their hands in the field say do look like some kind of pinking shears have cut the steers' tissue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

327. Image 3.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

328. Here is a close-up of that particular serrated edge from the side in the 1990 Oregon steer serrated excision that an Oregon State University veterinary diagnostic laboratory reported had been cut with high heat, image 5, consistent, and I'm reading now from the Oregon State University veterinary laboratory assessment, quote, "Consistent with a specimen collected via electrosurgical excision, it is not possible to tell whether this lesion was caused by a laser.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

329. It does appear consistent with a heat-induced injury," close quote, image 4.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

330. Here is another similar serrated edge found on a mutilated cow in 1975, we're going back almost 20 years, by the Cascade County Sheriff's Office in Great Falls, Montana.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

331. The issue of lasers came up early in the animal mutilation mystery because there was no blood.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

332. There had to have been some kind of cautery.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

333. But then I worked with John Altshuler, M.D. pathologist and hematologist in Denver, Colorado, going out to animal mutilation sites myself to collect tissue and fluid for him to study from the animals.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

334. One of his first confirmations was cooked hemoglobin in a mutilated cow, slide 6.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

335. Here is what normal cow collagen looks like under a microscope, image 7.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

336. And here is mutilated cow tissue in which the hemoglobin has been cooked by high heat at the excision site.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

337. Dr. Altshuler also showed me photomicrographs of the mutilator's excision in comparison with known laser surgery.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

338. Dr. Altshuler said, "The animal mutilation excisions do not show any carbon, but earth life is carbon based and all tissue exposed to the heat of a laser should show carbon residue that looks like black pepper grains under a microscope."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

339. We never found any carbon residue on mutilator excisions we studied, raising the question, what is the surgical instrument?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

340. Does it work by sound frequencies or some other technology unknown to earth medical science?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

341. Image 8.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

342. Here is a classic example of the bloodless removal of an udder from a cow that had just given birth in Ashdown, Arkansas, discovered on the morning of March 11, 1989.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

343. And I'm showing you -- letting you know, this is one of the cleanest kind of phenomena.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

344. The excision is there and the animal is not alive, but you can see how pristine the scenes are.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

345. The editor of the Little River News, Jim Williamson, contacted me and I called Dr. Altshuler who wanted Jim Williamson to cut a rectangle of cowhide that would include the mutilator's cut.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

346. Dr. Altshuler said, "Tissue slides from this cow quote prove that the cutting was done quickly with a hot instrument of some kind."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

347. He reported, "Examination of the tissues after fixation revealed cut edges to be very hard, difficult to cut, and appearing somewhat darker than the surrounding tissues, which does relate to high heat."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

348. Image 9.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

349. Photomicrograph number 1 has an arrow which points to the separation line.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

350. The abnormal tissue on the left shows a smudge pink change with nuclear fragmentation indicating tissue destruction and death.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

351. These changes are referred to as coagulative necrosis.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

352. The band between cutting margin and normal tissue is quite thin, suggesting that the dissection was done with what appears to be a pinpoint accuracy and minimal dissipation of heat at the cut line, "The heat is confined to a millimeter in these excisions."
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

353. Image 10.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

354. This photomicrograph shows dark pinkish-blue parallel bundles of cells at the cut edge of the tissue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

355. These changes are referred to as the string beans signed by a pathologist indicating tissue exposure to high heat, as in laser or hot needle surgery, but again, there is no carbon residue.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

356. Image 11.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

357. In this photomicrograph, the tissue is from below the hide surface and is called dermis.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

358. The upper portion clearly shows many spaces called vacuolar changes where the arrow is, which result from tissue cooking or exposure to high temperatures probably above 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

359. Image 12.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

360. In the lower left-hand corner of this photomicrograph is a distinct color change from a light normal pink to a dark pink.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

361. The darker collagen tissue is damaged from some injury source, but shows a striking lack of inflammatory change.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

362. This suggests that the procedure of injury was relatively fast.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

363. Taking all the microscopic findings into account, one would have to conclude that the surgical procedure performed on these animals took place quickly, probably in a minute or two, and utilized high-temperature heat as a cutting source applied in a fine probe or cutting instrument, close quote.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

364. We are talking about the excision of an ear, eye, jaw flesh, tongue, the sexual organs, and the rectum in less than two minutes, leaving physical evidence that has been repeated myself.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

365. I have cut tissue from at least 30 of these animals in pastures all over the United States, and all of the findings are exactly the same.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

366. How do you excise large sections of tissue and leave the evidence of high heat without carbon residue, no blood, and no tracks around the animals, and do it in two minutes or less?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

367. Len Lauber, head of animal mutilation investigations at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Calgary Alberta in 1980, where the local Canadian media were told by the RCMP that the cause of the mutilations there in the hundreds were satanic cults.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

368. But Lynn Lauber called me at KMGH TV in Denver after the broadcast of my TV documentary, A Strange Harvest, and he said that he had seen my documentary, and he was calling me because, and this is what he said to me, he knew that something from outer space was involved in the mutilations that the RCMP in Canada had investigated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

369. When I asked him why then have you told the media the perpetrators are satanic cults, he said the reason was that he felt the truth was too difficult to report publicly.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

370. And that to me sums up the metaphor of not just this 21st century or the 20th century, but this is a phenomena that I understand has been going on for thousands of years, and we are just catching up to it.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

371. And when Sheriff Tex Graves in September of 1979 in my very first interview with somebody in law enforcement about animal mutilations when I began doing A Strange Harvest, told me, Linda, the perpetrators are creatures from outer space, quote unquote, and I felt the same shock that perhaps you do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

372. The truth is law enforcement has long known from their own eyewitness accounts they've seen the beams of light in pastures.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

373. Ranchers have seen the glowing disks put beams down.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

374. Ranchers have seen animals rise into these glowing disks.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

375. The glowing disks have been seen lowering animals down in beams of light to pastures where they are then mutilated.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

376. And to get those people, law enforcement or ranchers, to stand up in front of a camera and tell the world what they've seen with their own eyes is the biggest difficulty of my entire career because we are on a planet where humans are more afraid of humans and they're ridicule than they are of extraterrestrials.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

377. I am hoping that in this citizen hearing, a kind of exercise to what I hope will take place.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

378. All of this should be presented in a formal, executive, official congressional hearing of why has the agencies of the United States government, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the DIA, the NRO, they've all been studying this.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

379. They have more data than I do.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

380. Why shouldn't this country get back on the track of being of and by and for the people and that we should know exactly what those agencies know?
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

381. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

382. Thank you.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

383. Thank you all for your fine testimony.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

384. I'd like to yield to my colleague from the House, Mr. Bartlett.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}

385. The floor is yours, sir.
→ {"text": "", "confidence": "", "notes": ""}
