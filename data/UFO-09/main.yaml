  source_text: On another occasion in October 1978, three uniformed police officers in a rural area of Buckinghamshire observed
    a huge object, which they described as a size of a football field, which suddenly and silently materialized in front of
    them in the blink of an eye and at relative close proximity to their position.

    field, which then traversed the ground as if scanning the terrain for several minutes.

    end of it because I would argue that in the high caliber witness categories, high caliber I would mean astronauts, cosmonauts,
    pilots, military and commercial, radar operators, sonar operators, in these very high caliber witness categories, the
    percentage after investigation would be much, much higher than that three percent.
