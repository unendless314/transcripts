    either with the understanding of the president or not to preserve plausible liability,
    either with the coordination of the study group that had formed around the president
    in 1947 or not, went to New York, to Boston, to Los Angeles to meet with people
    like David Sarnoff of NBC, the owners of The Times, the Hearst people, and one

    caliber I would mean astronauts, cosmonauts, pilots, military and commercial,
    radar operators, sonar operators, in these very high caliber witness categories,
    the percentage after investigation would be much, much higher than that three
    percent.
