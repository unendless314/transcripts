and UFO studies, the UFO abduction phenomena, and UFOs, organized religion and fundamentalist thinking."},{"segment_id":178,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As this morning's discussion topic is listed as various topics, I believe I qualify."},{"segment_id":179,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"While I stand ready to try and answer any questions to the best of my ability this committee may have, I'd particularly like to invite you to focus in on two of these particular areas of study."},{"segment_id":180,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"On the so-called UFO ridicule factor, we now know for a fact the subject of UFOs and their implications have been regarded as extremely serious by our military and intelligence communities from at least the summer of 1947 on."},{"segment_id":181,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"More seriously, in fact, than any other matter facing this nation since the end of World War II."},{"segment_id":182,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Why then have the overwhelming majority and Mr. Davenport hit the nail on the head?"},{"segment_id":183,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We divide the media's general relationship with the subject of UFOs into two areas."},{"segment_id":184,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Local and regional news gatherers are overall very serious, inquisitive, and genuinely respectful of this mystery."},{"segment_id":185,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Major media has singled this subject out for a level of ridicule, sarcasm, and condescension matched in post-war journalism."},{"segment_id":186,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"How and why did all of this come to pass, and what is its legacy for the American people?"},{"segment_id":187,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The second subject is one you were introduced to during yesterday morning's hearings."},{"segment_id":188,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That is the UK's Rendlesham Forest UFO incident."},{"segment_id":189,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I first heard of these events in the autumn of 1983, shortly after the story broke in Great Britain."},{"segment_id":190,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The following year I met and chatted briefly with Larry Warren, the former United States Air Force security police officer, who had completely on his own, and to a degree at great risk, certainly to his peace of mind and character, become the whistleblower in this case, was directly responsible for the FOIA that resulted in the release of Colonel Halt's January 1981 report, which was then published in England in '83 and the story broke."},{"segment_id":191,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Four years later we met again at a conference not far from here, at American University in Washington."},{"segment_id":192,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was very impressed with his presentation."},{"segment_id":193,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Fully authentic military witnesses who can be fully vetted and prove their involvement are not all that common."},{"segment_id":194,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You've had the privilege of hearing several of them yesterday afternoon."},{"segment_id":195,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I decided I wanted to interview this guy."},{"segment_id":196,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He decided after hearing me on a panel discussion, he wanted me to co-author a book with him."},{"segment_id":197,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We met the next weekend, talked all weekend, and by that Sunday afternoon we shook hands and I was very excited."},{"segment_id":198,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was going to be writing a book."},{"segment_id":199,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was looking for a serious project to get my teeth into."},{"segment_id":200,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I thought it might take a year or two, obviously result in a huge best seller movie deal, many checks to endorse, and women to fight off."},{"segment_id":201,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Life does not always work out the way you think."},{"segment_id":202,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The book took 10 years to complete."},{"segment_id":203,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It cost us everything we had."},{"segment_id":204,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It cost me to a great degree my peace of mind."},{"segment_id":205,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's brought me back to England since more than 20 times."},{"segment_id":206,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I had no idea of what I was getting into, but when we completed it, it was a best seller in the United Kingdom."},{"segment_id":207,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was immediately in the library of the then new Prime Minister Tony Blair, one of our greatest champions in the United Kingdom, became former Admiral of the Fleet, former Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense, Lord Peter Hill Norton, who as an MP brought his hardcover copy onto the book of the floor of House of Lords and confronted the then Secretary for Defense with four questions taken right out of the book, all of which were demured, when my co-author lost his passport, the State Department refusing to renew it for \"speaking out on sensitive defense issues in a public forum on foreign soil.\""},{"segment_id":208,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was nobody less than former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who pro bono helped us restore Larry's passport and continue our work."},{"segment_id":209,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The men who were involved in this as witnesses, and it was only touched on yesterday, were put through absolute hell."},{"segment_id":210,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Some of the things that were done to the more unconscionable as far as I'm concerned, and this is of more interest and focus for me than whatever the source of the intelligences behind the events of December 1980."},{"segment_id":211,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I applaud John and Jim for fighting for the truth to come out about this."},{"segment_id":212,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think all of these men are still struggling, and in fact, we are all clear in former deputy base commanders Charles Halt's terminology that these men were meddled with, and in some cases are still sorting out implanted memories from actual ones."},{"segment_id":213,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Hence comes a certain amount of contention within this case that continues 33 years after."},{"segment_id":214,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I hope I can clarify some of it fast, and again thank you for the privilege of appearing before you."},{"segment_id":215,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Your timing is excellent, Mr. Robbins."},{"segment_id":216,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Next witness is Gary Heseltine."},{"segment_id":217,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Heseltine."},{"segment_id":218,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Heseltine."},{"segment_id":219,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":220,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Good morning, and I will not go over 10 minutes of my practice."},{"segment_id":221,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My name is Gary Heseltine, and I am a recently retired police detective in England, having served almost 24 years with the British Transport Police."},{"segment_id":222,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For the majority of that time, for 20 years, I was a detective."},{"segment_id":223,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was dealing at the sharp end of evidential matters, having been involved in murder, manslaughter, rape, et cetera, et cetera."},{"segment_id":224,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I come to this subject on an evidential basis, and I think that is very necessary in this field."},{"segment_id":225,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I am here principally to speak on behalf of police officers worldwide who have witnessed UFOs, but I would also like to say that I am also one of the principal investigators of the Rendlesham Forest incident that my colleague, Peter, has alluded to, along with Linda Moulton-Howe."},{"segment_id":226,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would consider her as the three principal investigators of this incident."},{"segment_id":227,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're all doing very good work on it."},{"segment_id":228,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For the last five years, I have worked with Colonel Charles Holt, the man who wrote the Holt memorandum, the deputy base commander, of what was absolutely a nuclear facility."},{"segment_id":229,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And let me back that up by saying that for three years of my six years in the Royal Air Force, between 1983 and 1989, I served on two nuclear bases doing exactly the same job as what those U.S. Air Force policemen did, and the base at Bentwater is identical to the base that I was in West Germany where I worked."},{"segment_id":230,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let's cut the crap."},{"segment_id":231,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a nuclear issue."},{"segment_id":232,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":233,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In January 2002, moving to my police background, I created the Police Reporting UFO Sightings Database."},{"segment_id":234,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's commonly referred to as the Proof Force Police Database."},{"segment_id":235,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You have an information pack with that information."},{"segment_id":236,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's basically there for U.K. police officers to record on- and off-duty police sightings."},{"segment_id":237,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Believe me, over the 11 years of my research, nothing will surprise me what anybody says in this field about what they report."},{"segment_id":238,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It is truly extraordinary."},{"segment_id":239,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When I began my research 11 years ago into British police officers, there were approximately six cases involving 10 officers."},{"segment_id":240,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Eleven years later, I now have over 425 cases involving over 940 British police officers."},{"segment_id":241,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a significant amount, in my opinion."},{"segment_id":242,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These sightings have taken place the length and breadth of Britain and have been reported at all times of the day."},{"segment_id":243,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Whilst I'm not a big lover of statistics because they can be manipulated, I would say that the key statistic for me is that over 70 percent of these cases are multiple witness officer cases."},{"segment_id":244,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Therefore, it is significant corroboration to a sighting event—again, I look at this case through evidential eyes."},{"segment_id":245,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In one particular case, there is in excess of 24 police officers that were involved in tracking at least one object over six counties of Britain on the night of March 30, 31, 1993."},{"segment_id":246,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is referred to as the Cosford Incident."},{"segment_id":247,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Many police officers have observed structured craft of huge size and proportions in close proximity to their ground positions."},{"segment_id":248,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"These craft range in shape and size and dimensions from many tens of feet to many hundreds of feet in size."},{"segment_id":249,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Many of the police cases on the database, in my opinion, are truly extraordinary."},{"segment_id":250,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For example, in October 1984 near RAF Northolt, Middlesex, a silent black triangular object was seen at low altitude by two uniformed police officers on mobile patrol wallet, which they described as being the size of three football fields."},{"segment_id":251,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When I sought to clarify this description of size, they said when they saw it, it was above three football fields."},{"segment_id":252,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think that's pretty good representation of size."},{"segment_id":253,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This report was made by Police Constable Robin Perry of the Metropolitan Police."},{"segment_id":254,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"On another occasion in October 1978, three uniformed police officers in a rural area of Buckinghamshire observed a huge object, which they described as a size of a football field, which suddenly and silently materialized in front of them in the blink of an eye and at relative close proximity to their position."},{"segment_id":255,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"However, there were also a number of smaller objects flying around the large main object akin to a mothership kind of scenario, and the larger object then projected a beam down to the ground, which was the width of the football field, which then traversed the ground as if scanning the terrain for several minutes."},{"segment_id":256,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They watched this event for approximately five minutes before suddenly it went off and then dematerialized in the blink of an eye."},{"segment_id":257,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One second it was there, and then it was gone."},{"segment_id":258,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This has been described as like switching on a light bulb on and off, not something that I think our stealth capability is quite capable of yet."},{"segment_id":259,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The source of that report is the Police Constable Eric Raymond, retired of the Thames Valley Police."},{"segment_id":260,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Many officers have seen objects that appear to move in ways that seem to defy our laws of known physics and aerodynamics."},{"segment_id":261,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For example, in May 1981 and 1982, two firearms officers were involved in the close protection of what was then a very prominent conservative minister in a rural location in North Yorkshire."},{"segment_id":262,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"At approximately 5.30 hours in the morning, as they were walking in the grounds of this residence, they suddenly became aware that the sunshine had darkened, the sky had darkened."},{"segment_id":263,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And they looked up to establish the cause of that."},{"segment_id":264,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They were amazed to see a huge, dark, purple, cylindrical object with a pronounced undercarriage underneath it that was described as being the length of a football field, a common figure in all of this, and hovering silently above the house at an altitude of only two to three hundred feet, which is extremely close."},{"segment_id":265,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The object remained motionless, silent above the house for five to ten minutes before it suddenly and silently accelerated in the blink of an eye out to the horizon, where it stopped in an instant for a few seconds and then disappeared towards the horizon and out of sight."},{"segment_id":266,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The source of this report is police sergeant retired John Pawson of the North Yorkshire Police."},{"segment_id":267,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In my introduction, I mentioned that I would refer to police officer sightings worldwide."},{"segment_id":268,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And in the time permitted, I would like to draw your attention to just two particular countries where numerous police officer sightings have taken place."},{"segment_id":269,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Namely, I refer to the United States and Belgium."},{"segment_id":270,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Many of the U.S. cases are simply outstanding, and I will highlight just two of them."},{"segment_id":271,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Just after midnight on the 14th of December 1994, fifteen police officers of Trumbull County, Ohio, observed multiple circular UFOs from different geographical positions."},{"segment_id":272,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In one particular sighting, the engine of the police vehicle driven by Sergeant Toby Mollero suddenly cut out."},{"segment_id":273,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When he got out of the vehicle, he looked up and a UFO was directly above him shining a beam down."},{"segment_id":274,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As soon as the object moved away, his engine restarted and he attempted a short pursuit."},{"segment_id":275,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"On the 5th of January 2000 in Illinois, multiple police officers observed a large triangular craft that was witnessed from many geographical positions and were sometimes seen at close proximity to their ground locations."},{"segment_id":276,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Broadly speaking, all the officers involved in both of these incidents described crafts that moved in silence which were able to make incredibly high speed maneuvers unlike that of any known aircraft."},{"segment_id":277,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Finally, in the skies above Belgium between 1989 and 1991, hundreds of police officers observed large triangular objects all over the country."},{"segment_id":278,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Many of these sightings involved multiple police officer witnesses and were frequently seen at close proximity to their ground locations."},{"segment_id":279,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In addition, many of these sightings were confirmed on multiple civilian radar and multiple military radar facilities."},{"segment_id":280,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In the allotted ten minutes given to brief you, which I'm trying to keep to, I would like to say on behalf of police officers worldwide that they are seeing actual structured craft, physical in nature and which move in ways that they have never seen before or since."},{"segment_id":281,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In closing, I urge this panel to accept their collective testimonies as genuine and that they offer compelling circumstantial evidence that many of these sightings represent extraordinary, unknown structured craft moving in the Earth's airspace."},{"segment_id":282,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In closing and on a personal note, I believe that the time is now to lift the veil of secrecy that has shrouded this subject for over 60 years and the subject of UFOs should now be openly accepted in the mainstream media as being real in nature and which in turn would allow people to come forward from all walks, all life, all countries without the fear of ridicule and a risk to their careers."},{"segment_id":283,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As a police detective of many years' service, I believe that the collective testimonial documentary and physical evidence obtained in over 60 years of UFO research overwhelmingly confirms that some, and I repeat the word some, UFO sightings do represent an ongoing extraterrestrial engagement with planet Earth."},{"segment_id":284,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I am deeply honoured to be here before you today and thank you, the panel, for being courageous in coming forward at probably some cost to yourselves in your reputation, but you are and whether the mainstream media are here or not, this is historic and it will be looked back as an historic event and you will be congratulated in time for your participation."},{"segment_id":285,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":286,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much, investigative detective, I just want to underscore that your passion really underscores the significance of your testimony and that's a worthy, it's a virtue."},{"segment_id":287,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now we come to our last panelist for this round, who's graced us with her, she doesn't have her little hat today,

great to have you back, Ms Howe, please."},{"segment_id":293,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Because I'm going to talk about a subject that is perhaps one of the most difficult when it comes to the UFO phenomena, I thought I would give you a little bit more context about my background and to Jennifer, who is handling the slides, please wait until I call for them by number."},{"segment_id":294,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My name is Linda Moulton Howe, my master's degree in communication is from Stanford University, Palo Alto, California in 1968, I attached a bio for you to my statement today."},{"segment_id":295,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Since then, I have produced two dozen TV documentaries, including the regional Emmy Award, honored a strange

of the subjects that I have been asked to talk about is all of the work that I have done in the investigation of animal mutilations around the world."},{"segment_id":303,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The first global media report about this phenomena was in September of 1967 when a female horse named Lady was found dead on a ranch near Alamosa in southern Colorado."},{"segment_id":304,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The horse's entire skull and long neck had been stripped of flesh and every organ in the chest of that horse had been

nearby."},{"segment_id":306,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And there were no tracks of the animal."},{"segment_id":307,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was powdery soil and the animal is lying there stripped of flesh, but there were no tracks around the body, not even the own horse's tracks."},{"segment_id":308,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But a hundred and some feet away there were horse tracks in a circle as if the horse had been caught in something in which the feet had gone around in a circle and then a hundred and some feet away the body was

here that UFOs were a real subject, unidentified flying objects."},{"segment_id":404,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Even the Air Force in their not very truthful fact sheet on closing down Project

they?\""},{"segment_id":407,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There's clearly something out there that cannot be explained as beams of light or swamp gas or hallucinations or anything."},{"segment_id":408,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When more than one person sees it from different angles, when there is a radar track, this is real."},{"segment_id":409,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's not something that you can argue away."},{"segment_id":410,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"My hope is, as a result of this hearing, that the media will, even if they believe that this is all crazy, that everyone who believes in, now I believe in UFOs."},{"segment_id":411,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm not quite there yet that they're extraterrestrial."},{"segment_id":412,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Maybe that's because I'm a scientist and I know that the closest possible place I'm told where there could be life is 37 light years away."},{"segment_id":413,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What that means is unless they have some way of communicating faster than the speed of light it takes 74 years to ask a question and get an answer back."},{"segment_id":414,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So obviously you can't be controlling something from that far away."},{"segment_id":415,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, my forbearers, not very long ago since I am Anglo-Saxon, my forbearers not very long ago were running around Europe in animal skins in a stone age."},{"segment_id":416,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I have to be pretty arrogant and presumptuous to believe that there isn't somewhere out there in this huge universe some civilization more developed than mine."},{"segment_id":417,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I note that we still have these stupid wars and kill each other and there's got to be a civilization somewhere in

else just has to be very, very high, doesn't it?"},{"segment_id":419,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would hope that what comes of this hearing is that the press recognizes that here is an opportunity for some really interesting stories."},{"segment_id":420,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There is reporting out there and then after the reporting what is the explanation of it?"},{"segment_id":421,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm sure the Air Force thought that they could explain away nearly 12,000, 12,618 sightings."},{"segment_id":422,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They explained away all but 701 of them."},{"segment_id":423,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And there are a lot of sightings that are searchlights on clouds and that sort of thing."},{"segment_id":424,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So it would make very interesting press I would think to report these sightings and then to report the analysis of the sighting."},{"segment_id":425,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What did it mean?"},{"segment_id":426,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So the press doesn't have to buy in to extraterrestrials, they don't have to buy into any of this."},{"segment_id":427,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They simply need to do what the press I think is supposed to do and that is report what's out there."},{"segment_id":428,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And why wouldn't this make, you know, and they don't have to buy into the lunatic fringe, you know, if somebody cites something, somebody cites something, why not report it?"},{"segment_id":429,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They don't even report the sighting."},{"segment_id":430,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They don't report anything."},{"segment_id":431,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know, you've told me about fairly recent sightings, I haven't heard any of that in the press."},{"segment_id":432,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, a number of years ago there were mentions of that in the press."},{"segment_id":433,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mentioned the one time I was listening, I can't remember the year, it was quite some time ago, but you may be able to tell me what the year was by the confluence of the two events."},{"segment_id":434,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"One was sightings over New Mexico and the other was a report that two people had died in New York City from what might have been psittacosis, and if it was psittacosis it might have come from dried pigeon manures, so maybe we ought to kill all the pigeons in New York City."},{"segment_id":435,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I thought to myself, you know, with that kind of logic, if I was out there from somewhere else watching us, I think I'd want to watch a little longer before I contacted these people."},{"segment_id":436,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I hope that that's what comes of this."},{"segment_id":437,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As I say, you know, there are unidentified flying objects."},{"segment_id":438,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I came here with an open mind."},{"segment_id":439,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm not quite there yet that they're extraterrestrial because I'm not sure how they would control things when the closest possible life, I'm told, is 37 light years away."},{"segment_id":440,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now, you know, I couldn't imagine, my forebears couldn't imagine of the iPhones of today, so clearly there may be travel faster than the speed of light."},{"segment_id":441,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There may be ways to communicate that we can't begin to understand, but, you know, the phenomenon is real."},{"segment_id":442,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They are here."},{"segment_id":443,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There are thousands of reportings, you know, and I will do everything I can."},{"segment_id":444,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think I have some credibility."},{"segment_id":445,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I will try to do everything I can to convince the press that they -- there's some interesting stories here."},{"segment_id":446,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know, the story may be this guy's really a wacko, isn't he?"},{"segment_id":447,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He's reporting these crazy things."},{"segment_id":448,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In any event, isn't there an interesting story to all of these sightings?"},{"segment_id":449,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There is something there."},{"segment_id":450,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Why -- who has been successful in convincing the press that these are not reportable?"},{"segment_id":451,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Supposed to be a free press, free country, the truth out there."},{"segment_id":452,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Why isn't it?"},{"segment_id":453,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":454,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's turning into a Senate hearing, you know, where we give our views, and of course, I'm guilty of that for the last two

it."},{"segment_id":459,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'd like to just add on to what Congressman Bartlett said."},{"segment_id":460,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's not just the press that needs to start bringing this forward."},{"segment_id":461,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's our government, and we know that."},{"segment_id":462,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Maybe if our government will listen and investigate -- I mean, they're doing it somewhere probably, but if they'd bring it out in the open, that would make interesting press, and it would not be press libeled kooks, I don't believe."},{"segment_id":463,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I actually have questions, but I want to say, there's no kooks in this room, and I am so impressed with all of you, so thank you for letting me be part of it."},{"segment_id":464,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, Peter Davenport, you said that there's over 80,000 written reports and examples that you get, I mean, reports you get every year on your hotline and in your organization?"},{"segment_id":465,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We receive probably between 3,000 and 6,000 reports a

example or two of what somebody would call about that actually resulted in incredible action."},{"segment_id":468,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you for the question, Congresswoman Woolsey."},{"segment_id":469,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would go right to the Phoenix Lights case in response to your question, the most dramatic case that I've handled in my roughly 50, 60

extraordinary."},{"segment_id":475,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That object was capable of hovering motionless for five minutes."},{"segment_id":476,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I'm going to ask you to talk about what came of that."},{"segment_id":477,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So you discovered, you heard something, of something and it turned out to be something that people could see and what came of it?"},{"segment_id":478,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So why did it matter that we knew this?"},{"segment_id":479,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well it appears that a very unusual event occurred."},{"segment_id":480,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's generated multiple books, six videotapes of various objects that night were taken."},{"segment_id":481,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It was an extraordinary event that went largely unreported in the national press."},{"segment_id":482,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It

your understanding that those technologies aren't common knowledge?"},{"segment_id":509,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Oh I think they're common knowledge in popular culture but the specifics of the

minute."},{"segment_id":524,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Miss Moulton-Howe, explain a little bit further, I don't understand how these pieces and parts of the tissues are used, a genetic harvest, it's a genetic harvest."},{"segment_id":525,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"To be used how?"},{"segment_id":526,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm not there yet, I don't get it."},{"segment_id":527,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What are they doing with it?"},{"segment_id":528,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They're going to take it back to outer space and do something, what are they doing with it?"},{"segment_id":529,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think that the answer is very complicated."},{"segment_id":530,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think it involves on a more sophisticated level what we are beginning to do in our science with cloning and if you are advanced and you can take genetic material and you can clone, you can probably clone anything."},{"segment_id":531,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So there is a chance, there is maybe the idea that we have parts of animals, parts of living animals that the aliens would like to clone because they are maybe stronger than what they have or why do they want ours?"},{"segment_id":532,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't have all the answers but genetic, a harvest of tissue, there might be a reason for why specific pieces and tissues are harvested, not because anything is being done with the bovine itself, it's the genetic DNA, it's the DNA that would be used."},{"segment_id":533,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So it's not a religious sacrament or it's not symbolic?"},{"segment_id":534,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're talking about medical cloning."},{"segment_id":535,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Could I just come in there to back up Linda there?"},{"segment_id":536,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think we have to put things in perspective and it goes back to addressing the question in your last question."},{"segment_id":537,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Realistically, every UFO researcher in the world will say of 100% of cases, 95% of them turn out to have a mundane explanation, that's a generally accepted figure worldwide."},{"segment_id":538,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Have a mundane, whether it be astronomical misinterpretation, that's a generally accepted figure."},{"segment_id":539,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But really where we start to delve down is when we look at the 5%, well when you look at the 5% after investigation you end up with probably about 3% of hardcore cases."},{"segment_id":540,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now these are hardcore cases after investigation, well I am bothered about the 97% and your remit here is not really to speculate in my opinion as to where and what they're doing, it's really to establish the facts."},{"segment_id":541,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the facts are very, very apparent from very credible people that we are demonstrating that this is a subject that needs to be addressed on an evidential basis."},{"segment_id":542,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it's not for us to speculate really where they're coming from, what their agenda is, it's really to look at the evidence."},{"segment_id":543,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a hearing to look at evidence and this is what we should be doing."},{"segment_id":544,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the evidence in that 3% is what counts and the media really need to look at the 3%, the cases that defy all explanation after investigation, that's what evidence is."},{"segment_id":545,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is there evidence that would stand up in a court of law?"},{"segment_id":546,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes there is."},{"segment_id":547,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If there was a plain crash scenario just outside this building and we all happened to be on a coffee break, we'd all be material witnesses to it."},{"segment_id":548,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"However, when we talk about UFOs, the media suddenly make us all crazy."},{"segment_id":549,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that is wrong and this needs to be addressed and the panel in front of me are the representatives that can help make that happen."},{"segment_id":550,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We are relying on you to use your voice and experience to listen to the evidence."},{"segment_id":551,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And all any UFO investigator wants, all we want is a level playing field, that is not a lot to ask in the world, we just want to present evidence."},{"segment_id":552,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But sir, are you suggesting we listen and don't ask questions?"},{"segment_id":553,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, of course not, but in the limited timeframe that we have, we have only so little time."},{"segment_id":554,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If we don't ask the mundane, simple question that the public is asking, you aren't going to get anything out of this panel."},{"segment_id":555,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, I accept that, but we're here to look at evidence."},{"segment_id":556,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the evidence goes to implication and that's what you're asking about."},{"segment_id":557,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the implication of all of this is most of the world is probably at the stage of pretty lights in the sky that form patterns or can be stationary and put beams down."},{"segment_id":558,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And what I just presented to you in a brief way was just a tiny, tiny scratch on the surface of 33 years of my trying to understand animal mutilations and why, which goes out to a thousand other branches."},{"segment_id":559,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If the pretty lights in the sky and the beams for centuries have been involved with harvesting material from this earth, I don't know that there's any homo sapien who can answer why."},{"segment_id":560,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But there is no question in my mind or anybody who has investigated that we're dealing with advanced intelligences, with advanced technology that can fold space time, sir, that's how it's faster than the speed of light and that in so doing that their focus is on what we as homo sapiens have only begun to investigate and that is the DNA, the genetic material and that we're now finally doing experiments in the subject of cloning."},{"segment_id":561,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's a bottom line that what is happening on this planet and it has for centuries is there is a harvest of genetic material, plants, animals and humans."},{"segment_id":562,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Why and to what end is a very complicated story."},{"segment_id":563,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I think that what I had just realized and you're asking me the question which goes to implication is that the disconnect between the current world population of seven billion and what is actually happening on this planet in relationship to other intelligences, the gap is so great that to address the details that are known and what our government knows is so difficult that right now the inertia of silence on the part of government agencies who have a great deal of information, let me guarantee you, that they feel that this is a subject that cannot be presented."},{"segment_id":564,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I do know that there was a high ranking naval officer who told one of his lower ranking officers who had seen a craft who was exposed to the photographs from Roswell of the bodies."},{"segment_id":565,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The high ranking authority when asked by the low ranking authority who had seen the craft and asked the higher ranking, when are you going to tell the people?"},{"segment_id":566,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the answer was never."},{"segment_id":567,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the implication there politically is that we are now in the United States of America where there is an unstated policy of total complete silence for the foreseeable future because it is too difficult to change what has been known to something that might upend a lot of subjects."},{"segment_id":568,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would like to turn it now to Congressman Carolyn Kilpatrick, please."},{"segment_id":569,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That will be Congresswoman, sir."},{"segment_id":570,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, thank you."},{"segment_id":571,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":572,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I am easily corrected."},{"segment_id":573,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":574,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Not to correct you, just woman here."},{"segment_id":575,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I certainly want to appreciate and thank you all for coming again."},{"segment_id":576,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Every day is a different day."},{"segment_id":577,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is the first day of the rest of all of our lives."},{"segment_id":578,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"How we use it, how we put it together, how we share and give back is what we are here for."},{"segment_id":579,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I commend you for your testimony."},{"segment_id":580,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"A lot of notes, a lot of work and my mind is boggled."},{"segment_id":581,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think I want to ask you first, Mr. Hazelton, Royal Air Force, security, police, hundreds of incidents yet today, what is the position of the British government on UFOs?"},{"segment_id":582,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And is it similar to US who are cousins or is it something different or do we do this in British?"},{"segment_id":583,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Do they speak?"},{"segment_id":584,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Tell me what is the position there?"},{"segment_id":585,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The bottom line is that there is the special relationship with America and America is quite clearly the most secretive government in the world on UFOs and it leads, their fingers are in every decent UFO report around the world."},{"segment_id":586,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to know about Britain."},{"segment_id":587,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, well Britain follows generally America's lead on most things and Britain does the same."},{"segment_id":588,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They have been releasing over the last three and a half years several batches of files which are in terms of papers, hundreds of thousands of single sheets of paper."},{"segment_id":589,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"However, the majority of the paper that has been released is very low level, it's mostly correspondence and amongst that there are some very good cases."},{"segment_id":590,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"For example, a British case in 1957, Milton Torres, a pilot, US pilot flying over Ipswich in Suffolk, England and he was stationed there flying a super saber."},{"segment_id":591,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He was vectored towards a radar target and he was ordered to fire his missile at the target."},{"segment_id":592,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"He actually got the launch codes when he went to launch, it jammed."},{"segment_id":593,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, stop."},{"segment_id":594,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, in Britain."},{"segment_id":595,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Stop, yeah."},{"segment_id":596,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You don't give me cases."},{"segment_id":597,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We got cases."},{"segment_id":598,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay."},{"segment_id":599,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to know what's happening in Britain."},{"segment_id":600,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to know what's happening in the military."},{"segment_id":601,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Britain is very lame."},{"segment_id":602,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to know what's happening on top of the government."},{"segment_id":603,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The media is very similar to the US in not reporting, it belittles the subject and it's criminal and there is very little or no difference in the UK to the US."},{"segment_id":604,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a world phenomenon that we're discussing."},{"segment_id":605,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Absolutely."},{"segment_id":606,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You all know it way better than we do."},{"segment_id":607,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Absolutely."},{"segment_id":608,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've heard testimony now three days and read a month leading up to this, videos and all."},{"segment_id":609,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Miss Howe."},{"segment_id":610,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":611,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And it's really for all of you."},{"segment_id":612,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I think you ended your presentation on something like this."},{"segment_id":613,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What and why is such a profound reality."},{"segment_id":614,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes."},{"segment_id":615,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Not being built upon, internalized."},{"segment_id":616,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If I have my military who comes to me and tells me they've got data, experiences and other kinds of things that this is real, other countries I've been on elevator and in the hotels with others from Chile and Peru and everywhere else in the world or many places in the world, when we already acknowledge that whatever it is is more significant than what we have here and obviously in Britain and some of the other countries, the why of it, your scientific data is outstanding."},{"segment_id":617,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think the answer is probably in a coalition of nations and not in our governments."},{"segment_id":618,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Obviously because the governments know something we don't know and they aren't sharing it and it could be critical and catastrophic for the human being."},{"segment_id":619,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, let me add a post script to yesterday's presentation on vent waters."},{"segment_id":620,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's a major case that involved dozens of military people on a very important base."},{"segment_id":621,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I for one at least have been exposed to information from two people that within 24 hours of the Jim Peniston, John Burroughs and Ed Kvansack encounter with the black glassy craft with the hieroglyphic symbols on it in the forest that within 24 hours in the UK, the National Security Agency of the United States took over everything that was happening at Van Water."},{"segment_id":622,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They testified to that."},{"segment_id":623,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is important because it means that within 24 hours a decision had been made somewhere at some level between the United States and the UK that the United States would take precedent through the National Security Agency."},{"segment_id":624,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, stop."},{"segment_id":625,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We heard that."},{"segment_id":626,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, am I good?"},{"segment_id":627,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't know the scientific part."},{"segment_id":628,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm just going to tell you the political and what we do and what things we know about our country and the world and our relationships with very countries of the world."},{"segment_id":629,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You got to teach us something else."},{"segment_id":630,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Wait."},{"segment_id":631,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let me just finish my point because don't give me that testimony we had yesterday."},{"segment_id":632,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We all heard it, we got notes and we got to read it and embellish it."},{"segment_id":633,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to move it to the action phase."},{"segment_id":634,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You came here to ask us to do something and we got to know how, what and why."},{"segment_id":635,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Haven't got there yet."},{"segment_id":636,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Maybe by Friday or next month or as we move this over the next couple of years we'll get closer than you got in 30 years and you have to be commended."},{"segment_id":637,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What you have unveiled is something is there that we're not alone."},{"segment_id":638,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm still learning."},{"segment_id":639,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to learn more about that, in fact."},{"segment_id":640,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But as I learn it, the existence as we know it is being jeopardized and may not exist next week, let alone 30 more years."},{"segment_id":641,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I was only going to your point about international versus the United States."},{"segment_id":642,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's my impression that the United States for some reason politically is carrying the weight of the disclosure."},{"segment_id":643,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't know why because other countries have bodies, have craft, have photographs, have physical evidence."},{"segment_id":644,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But the United States going back to World War II and decisions that were made for some reason it is this country that seems to have the pivotal weight in the disclosure."},{"segment_id":645,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What do you think that is?"},{"segment_id":646,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What do you think that is?"},{"segment_id":647,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"U.S. is the, if it's not for real, it's perceived to be the power of the world."},{"segment_id":648,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's exactly the reason why it's not for real."},{"segment_id":649,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":650,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Right."},{"segment_id":651,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So we sit here in the power of the world, but the power not of this world or we don't know how it fits."},{"segment_id":652,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Do you think America wants to lose that power?"},{"segment_id":653,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Hold it, sir."},{"segment_id":654,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Hold it."},{"segment_id":655,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Hold it."},{"segment_id":656,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Hold it."},{"segment_id":657,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Hold it."},{"segment_id":658,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You can't interrupt a congressperson."},{"segment_id":659,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I will yield to you in a moment, though."},{"segment_id":660,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I will because I just want to, we just, we want to get to what we need to get to really and how we get to make it something so that we can all live another hundred years or thereabouts."},{"segment_id":661,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I'm going to yield to you, Mr. Heseltine, in just a second."},{"segment_id":662,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And you too."},{"segment_id":663,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't want to, I'm just getting antsy up here."},{"segment_id":664,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Today you all took it to, every day it's another level, woo, woo, but I hate how we trivialize this situation."},{"segment_id":665,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Exactly."},{"segment_id":666,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I hate the men with the horns and all that and what my colleague read yesterday."},{"segment_id":667,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And that's been since day one."},{"segment_id":668,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I'm telling you, what we know, it's so profound and so big and so real when you don't know how to deal with it, you trivialize it."},{"segment_id":669,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So when people think that we're coming, you all have been combining us, we've all taken a lot of flak and we're proud of it."},{"segment_id":670,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're servants of the people."},{"segment_id":671,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But to come here and then hear this other crap in my home paper as well, I don't even talk to them because you can't say conspiracy if you're a congressman because they really think you're wacko."},{"segment_id":672,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But there's something out here that's been coordinated from our leadership, not the president person, but the office and our military and our press that's a national conglomeration that continues."},{"segment_id":673,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And unless we can somehow step outside of that and build some kind of coalitions and work and pray and build and speak and teach, we're going to lose."},{"segment_id":674,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And what will the world be?"},{"segment_id":675,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It might be those things that have been drawn for all of my life."},{"segment_id":676,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I yield to Mr. Heseltine rest of my time."},{"segment_id":677,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"May I make a suggestion?"},{"segment_id":678,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You all as witnessed on Monday, the very what I thought it was an historic moment at the end when you were concluded, summing up the first day where you all said no, we should have congressional hearings."},{"segment_id":679,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now for a ufologist, that's an amazing thing for you to say."},{"segment_id":680,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I appreciate that tremendously."},{"segment_id":681,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But I think what I need you to do realistically as people with over 80 years experience is to say that to NBC, CNN."},{"segment_id":682,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So ring up your colleagues at 6 o'clock today and say I'm calling a press conference collectively where all six of you say we believe in you."},{"segment_id":683,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Do you think that the press, listen, we talked to the press for 10 minutes, 30 minutes."},{"segment_id":684,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They take the 10 seconds that they want."},{"segment_id":685,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's why it's got to be a people to people thing."},{"segment_id":686,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's not going to be from the press."},{"segment_id":687,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I know that, but we battle the press and that is

York Times was the flagship of Western journalism."},{"segment_id":720,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It still is in print terms."},{"segment_id":721,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The influence the Times exerted over the other news syndicates was marked."},{"segment_id":722,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The Copley Syndicate, Hearst Papers, all of the major American papers followed the Times lead as a rule, and the Times hit the floor with all four wheels spinning."},{"segment_id":723,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Every coverage, and I will be happy to send you an unpublished paper on this if you're curious."},{"segment_id":724,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Anybody on the committee was sarcastic, condescending, ridiculing, explaining away like a parent to a bad child."},{"segment_id":725,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Almost immediately they start to trot out authorities, often unnamed, often very contemptuous of the subject because overwhelmingly they're astronomers and psychologists."},{"segment_id":726,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You would actually laugh if you read some of these articles."},{"segment_id":727,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They're breathtaking in their ignorance and pseudo-science."},{"segment_id":728,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now what I did was I overlaid on that timeline of these articles several hundred authentic, fully vetted, declassified documents from every agency you can imagine."},{"segment_id":729,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would say it's about a 95% rate as you go through these where you see these silly headlines and phenomenally goofy excuses, and then you see Air Force, starting in September of '47, Air Force intelligence, Army intelligence, CIA, et cetera."},{"segment_id":730,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We are concerned these are not Soviet."},{"segment_id":731,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They may be extraterrestrials."},{"segment_id":732,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"By the way, two words at the time in 1947 and so on."},{"segment_id":733,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"What happened was it was drummed into the minds of editors, reporters that this is the way this thing is reported."},{"segment_id":734,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now again I stress these are the nationals."},{"segment_id":735,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The locals, as Peter said, have almost always had an inquiring mind and acted independently actually searching for information."},{"segment_id":736,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I cannot prove, I couldn't offer you a shred of real evidence of why I think this is and how it happened, but deductive reasoning, a lot of study and common sense suggest to me that a number of key individuals in the Truman administration, either with the understanding of the president or not to preserve plausible liability, either with the coordination of the study group that had formed around the president in 1947 or not, went to New York, to Boston, to Los Angeles to meet with people like David Sarnoff of NBC, the owners of The Times, the Hearst people, and one of several things passed."},{"segment_id":737,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"They basically said we're a little concerned based on that old bugaboo of Orson Welles in 1938, mass panic, you know everybody's worried about the Russians right now."},{"segment_id":738,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The president would consider it a personal favor if you kind of toe the line on this and just treat it not seriously or in some cases possibly saying, because these were major players, these folks were power brokers and among the most influential people in the country at the time, that we need your assistance, it's your patriotic duty."},{"segment_id":739,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now once that pattern was set into place, what reporter that picks up on the reality of this and wants to do a serious piece of reportage is going to risk their career?"},{"segment_id":740,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We all know it's a joke."},{"segment_id":741,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Now to a great degree, that pattern is still stuck in the major media."},{"segment_id":742,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It is changing, but that, I believe, is how it began."},{"segment_id":743,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And one of, thank you."},{"segment_id":744,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I think I have one minute left, anyone that would like to tackle this question."},{"segment_id":745,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We've got a problem time-wise, a serious problem time-wise."},{"segment_id":746,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I yield back my one minute."},{"segment_id":747,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you very much."},{"segment_id":748,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I would ask my colleague."},{"segment_id":749,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I hope you make that up somewhere."},{"segment_id":750,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yes, oh yeah."},{"segment_id":751,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You know where we're going to make it up?"},{"segment_id":752,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're not going to eat today, if we keep it up."},{"segment_id":753,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're going to have the food of knowledge, but not much more."},{"segment_id":754,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'd like to ask my colleague if he could restrict his time."},{"segment_id":755,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm going to wipe my time out because we've been liberal in letting the witnesses express themselves and that's of course why we're here, for you to express yourself."},{"segment_id":756,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"But here too, since this doesn't work, maybe this works."},{"segment_id":757,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"When you see me doing that, wind it down intelligently."},{"segment_id":758,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":759,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And just a brief close to what he was saying, and that is that one year after the July 47 crashes, there was another one in Aztec, New Mexico in March of 1948."},{"segment_id":760,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And the editor of the Farmington newspaper at the time did receive, from all that we have been able to learn, did receive a request by somebody in the Pentagon to not report about what had happened, that there was distinct pressure put on to a local editor."},{"segment_id":761,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And I believe that that is the way that the Defense Department and local media, that was shortly after World War II, and so the population was less and the local media were much, much more inclined to take some requests by the Pentagon."},{"segment_id":762,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you."},{"segment_id":763,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I now yield to Congressman Mike Cook, Mayor Cook, I'm sorry."},{"segment_id":764,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you, Mr. Chair."},{"segment_id":765,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Mr. Davenport, you indicated you received about 86,000 incidents, I guess, over the years, about 3,000 to 5,000 a year."},{"segment_id":766,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Your list here of 62, and I appreciate that you went back to 1936 on the first one, and I noticed that probably 55 or more are more recent, probably in the last 15 or 16 years."},{"segment_id":767,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I take it this might be a top 62 hit list or something of incidents that you think."},{"segment_id":768,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So what I'm really asking is, what was the standard that you used for including these, and they are certainly interesting, events and sightings."},{"segment_id":769,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Thank you for the question, Congressman Cook."},{"segment_id":770,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"There were several criteria, the drama involved with the sighting, the degree of corroboration, the degree of verification, but in essence, I drew up that list as a distillation from the 86,000 cases for the committee's benefit to show you some of the more dramatic, well-founded cases that we have in our database."},{"segment_id":771,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And you, like others that have studied this, would probably say that a high percentage of the 86,000 that you've received are probably not credible."},{"segment_id":772,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, it doesn't take a very high percentage to make a really important case here, so I'm trying to get a sense of what you think would be a credible percentage of all those numbers."},{"segment_id":773,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's very difficult to quantify that."},{"segment_id":774,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I've attempted to do it, but the difficulty is, it is very difficult to know for sure with 100 percent accuracy what is a genuine UFO sighting and what is not."},{"segment_id":775,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I think you've put together some very good work on sightings of UFOs."},{"segment_id":776,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"So I'm going to jump to the next thing, and until I saw the last statement, I was sort of accepting this, but I have to say, and it's not too different than the concern that I think Congressman Bartlett expressed earlier."},{"segment_id":777,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You said here at the back, without indicating ET aspects of these sightings -- now, maybe there are some that you just didn't include in this list, but it's a fact that we have -- that this is ET, that ET is real, and I'm just asking you, how -- well, let me ask you this."},{"segment_id":778,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Isn't it a leap to say, okay, UFOs exist as Dr. -- well, Dr. Bartlett has indicated, and then saying it's ET."},{"segment_id":779,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, aren't there other explanations for UFOs?"},{"segment_id":780,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Are there no other explanations?"},{"segment_id":781,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is it the only explanation?"},{"segment_id":782,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's what I'm asking."},{"segment_id":783,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":784,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Probably not the only explanation."},{"segment_id":785,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I have to say that because we don't have a definitive answer yet to what we're dealing with, but it is difficult for me to imagine that some of the craft and some of the circumstances that are reported to our center are of terrestrial origin, just given the flight characteristics of many of the craft reported to us."},{"segment_id":786,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"In other words, probably in these 62 cases, you would say it's the best explanation."},{"segment_id":787,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Is that what you're saying?"},{"segment_id":788,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And is that why they get included on the list, if you think it's the best explanation for ET?"},{"segment_id":789,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Or you're just saying, hey, there was credibility."},{"segment_id":790,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We don't know what it was yet, but clearly they saw something."},{"segment_id":791,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"It's very strange."},{"segment_id":792,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, you have some ET index that you're applying to this list."},{"segment_id":793,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I take it?"},{"segment_id":794,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Or you wouldn't said that at the end?"},{"segment_id":795,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Yeah."},{"segment_id":796,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would not have included those cases in that list had they not been of extreme interest to me."},{"segment_id":797,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I am a scientist trained in that capacity, and I would not have included those cases in that list had they not had associated with them good, solid, hard objective evidence."},{"segment_id":798,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"As part of your scientific training, you are saying here that it's still a leap between a belief in a UFO and knowing without a doubt that it's ET."},{"segment_id":799,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would say more-- You said yes?"},{"segment_id":800,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would say more-- Well, you said, yeah, but I want to make sure I hear this correct."},{"segment_id":801,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"And really, I want you to say what you truthfully believe and think based on your experience."},{"segment_id":802,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Clearly you've had a lot of time to think about this a lot, and you are obviously an impressively trained scientist."},{"segment_id":803,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would characterize it not so much as a leap as a step in that direction, and if these craft are not of extraterrestrial origin, I have no explanation for them."},{"segment_id":804,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Craft that can hover motionless for five minutes above Phoenix, craft that can accelerate at a rate so fast that it's reported from multiple witnesses their eyes could not follow the craft as it departed."},{"segment_id":805,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I understand the maneuvering that you're saying, and it's certainly the best maybe, in your mind, the best explanation."},{"segment_id":806,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'd like to go to Gary Heseltine, I have to say that I'm particularly impressed with your list of sightings, and the reason I'm impressed is because they're from policemen, every one of these."},{"segment_id":807,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"This is a pretty thick list, a lot of them, so I imagine the credibility on your list you would rank as certainly higher than what many people that collect data would indicate."},{"segment_id":808,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I don't want to put any words in your mouth."},{"segment_id":809,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, you've actually highlighted something that I hope to be able to answer, and I think the real answer is that when I said to you before that the accepted figure is three percent after investigation, well that's not really the end of it because I would argue that in the high caliber witness categories, high caliber I would mean astronauts, cosmonauts, pilots, military and commercial, radar operators, sonar operators, in these very high caliber witness categories, the percentage after investigation would be much, much higher than that three percent."},{"segment_id":810,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I would hazard a guess that if you looked at military pilots with millions of dollars spent on their training, the percentage of error would be much reduced, and I would hazard a guess that it would be something in the region of 80 percent plus were accurate."},{"segment_id":811,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, then I'm going to quickly ask you, well I'm not going to ask you because I only have a minute left, but I'm going to say certainly credibility of people like Captain Solace who's sitting here in the front row, that probably caused the United States Air Force to come up with filters over their ICBM silos is certainly going to be a credible experience in the UFO."},{"segment_id":812,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I think that's where we need to look at when we look at collective evidence."},{"segment_id":813,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I'm sorry to catch you, but I know that we're trying, I'm going to ask Ms. Howe, very interesting slides, very interesting, Nevada Proving Ground, Dagway, Utah, I'm from Utah, talk about secrets, let's talk about nuclear testing secrets, could nuclear testing have a lot to do with these animal carcasses and the bloodless?"},{"segment_id":814,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Isn't that a..."},{"segment_id":815,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Our first test was in July of 1945, there are mutilation records going back, as I said, to 1911."},{"segment_id":816,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Okay, good answer."},{"segment_id":817,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Let me ask you this though, the one thing that maybe I scratched my head on a little bit for a statement, well, I scratch my head on a lot, I'll have to say that, that it absolutely is evidence of genetic harvesting."},{"segment_id":818,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I mean, that may be your belief, that may be something that you..."},{"segment_id":819,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You say there's..."},{"segment_id":820,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"No, it's not a belief."},{"segment_id":821,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Are you saying there's no possibility it could be anything but genetic harvesting, what these slides are showing?"},{"segment_id":822,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're not in the context of belief here at all."},{"segment_id":823,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"We're in the context of hard physical evidence, medical evidence."},{"segment_id":824,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The purpose of how that was, how that carcass ended up the way it was, is what I'm asking."},{"segment_id":825,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That has to be..."},{"segment_id":826,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"You're saying that's proof, absolute 100% proof, to the extent that the law of gravity is pretty much proven."},{"segment_id":827,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"The next round of the hearing is documents, and there have been leaked documents from inside our own government, in which the phrase extraterrestrial biological entities, with the acronym, all caps, E-B-E-S, has been included since at least a printing of what I think is a document that none of us have found any dispute over, the SOM 101 document with a 1954 war office stamp on it."},{"segment_id":828,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"If our government, going back to FDR, which there were also leaked documents about the discussion between FDR and the Secretary of War, Marshall, after February 1942, made the front page of the Los Angeles Times, the photograph of our artillery and beams going up to a diamond shaped object, distributing some 1,417 bullets, and then having that discussed in documents by Franklin Delano Roosevelt with the Secretary of War, and that in those documents that had been leaked, it uses the terms, these were interplanetary, celestial, and that we were retrieving these craft because we wanted to examine them."},{"segment_id":829,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That puts a context here, again, that would be before the war."},{"segment_id":830,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"Well, I appreciate you're telling me that that's interesting to me, but you don't allow any of the wiggle room that, for example, Mr. Davenport seems to allow in terms of final conclusions, and that's certainly your right, because you've looked at these things a lot more than I have."},{"segment_id":831,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"I want to get the best information I can, as credibly put together as I can, to help, as I said, break down the truth embargo."},{"segment_id":832,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"That's what we need to do first, and maybe we have to do it a brick at a time."},{"segment_id":833,"speaker_group":1,"source_text":"[BLANK_AUDIO]"}]
