1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,160
 It's going to be an educational week, for sure.

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:25,160
 And we are, as Chairman Bartlett said, we're going to be sitting like we are in committee,

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,560
 and we're going to pattern what we're doing today after a formal congressional hearing.

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:41,040
 And first of all, we have with us Congresswoman Darlene Houley, and we have Senator Gravel,

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,440
 Mike Gravel.

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:55,080
 We have Congresswoman Carolyn Kilpatrick, and we have Congressman Merrill Cook.

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,240
 And we are all retired.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:09,560
 So among us, we have 80 years or more experience, but 80 years just on the federal level.

9
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,840
 And Roscoe and I, we're classmates.

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,600
 We have 20 years each.

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:24,240
 And I have to tell you, it is our commitment today, as if we were part of a hearing in

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:32,720
 the House of Representatives, it's our commitment to listen through objective ears and to ask

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,760
 the kinds of questions that we think that the American people would like us to ask so

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:47,600
 that they can become better informed, because obviously there's going to be a press on this.

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,680
 And we would like to make the public more aware, and we would like to have a hearing

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,840
 that could lead possibly to legislation or policymaking.

17
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,600
 So if we're objective, if we're businesslike, and we stick to the issue, I think we're going

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,640
 to have a very, very interesting week.

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,080
 And right now, though, we get to swear in the first two witnesses.

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:24,040
 And initially, I think, Dr. Edgar Mitchell will be brought in on Skype.

21
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 Good morning, Dr. Mitchell.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
 Good morning.

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:34,680
 I am a former astronaut, proof of the moon on Apollo 14.

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,280
 And so I have a little bit of out-of-the-earth experience, but also I grew up near Roswell,

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:49,520
 New Mexico on a ranch flight, and the so-called Roswell incident of 1947 occurred when I was

26
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,400
 a senior in high school and getting ready to go off to college in the East.

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,200
 So and I have been interested in this subject for many years, but let me set up the basic

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:13,560
 credentials-- for the first time in our human history, our technology is showing us how

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,720
 huge our universe-- well, let's just call it a multiverse-- is with billions and billions

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,880
 of galaxies and galactic clusters and stars, and many of them-- and we identified a few--

31
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:37,160
 many of them so far that possibly could have living systems on them, living beings.

32
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:45,960
 And we have a history that I'm aware of, particularly starting with the Roswell incident, but even

33
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:53,160
 long before that, that we have been visited by aliens or visitors from different star

34
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,640
 systems and different planets.

35
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:02,360
 And of course, if we continue our endeavors, we will in due course be able to go outside

36
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,840
 our solar system as well.

37
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,880
 At the moment, our technology is not allowing us to do that, but in due course, we will

38
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:17,520
 be able to do that, I'm quite sure, and we must because our sun will only last a few

39
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:25,680
 more billion years, and we're even doing things to it that cause it to be-- a life on this

40
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,480
 planet to be unsustainable, either way we're going by using non-maneuverable resources

41
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,360
 and so forth.

42
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,080
 And so we have to rethink about this whole issue of our being here on this planet at

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,240
 this point in time, and how do we continue our life here, and how do we continue being

44
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,640
 stalwart citizens of planet Earth and keeping our civilization going and eventually be able

45
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,720
 to leave our planet and go somewhere else and investigate somewhere else, because we're

46
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,280
 not alone in the universe.

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,280
 They have been coming here for a long, long time, it seems, the evidence would suggest

48
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
 that.

49
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,320
 We have been having visitors for a long, long time, perhaps hundreds, maybe even thousands

50
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
 of years.

51
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,040
 There's some that would even say that the pyramid is both in Egypt and in South America,

52
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:25,920
 that the aliens aided us in building those, and that seems to have a reasonable ring to

53
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
 it.

54
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,080
 But in any event, we're not alone in the universe, and we're only now beginning to get enough

55
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,000
 evidence through our science and our understanding of the way the universe is put together to

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,200
 recognize we really are alone, and that we can, in due course, just like others have,

57
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
 it appears.

58
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,560
 They come here, we go there.

59
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,240
 And so I think we'll have a lot of testimony here today regarding that fact, and I urge

60
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,200
 you to listen to it, and let's open this up to the larger picture that, and acknowledge,

61
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,080
 yes, we're not alone.

62
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,800
 We are, they are here.

63
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
 We can't go there, and in due course, we will.

64
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,400
 And for the last, I've been very interested in this for the last 16 or 17 years on a basis

65
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:22,680
 of speaking about it publicly, and since I went to the moon 47 years ago, and my co-colleague

66
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,200
 Gordon Cooper also had an incident when he was at Edwards Air Force Base as a duty officer

67
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,320
 at a UFO land while he was on duty.

68
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,880
 So there's a number of us that have had these types of experiences to say, yes, we're not

69
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
 alone.

70
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,880
 We have been visited, and let's go forward in understanding this phenomenon.

71
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,680
 And I hope you have a good week, and I'll stay, stay with you as long as I can.

72
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
 Thank you.

73
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
 (Applause.)

74
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
 >> Good morning.

75
00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:06,200
 I'm Paul Hellyer, former Minister of Defense of Canada.

76
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,740
 And a long-time participant in politics and governance.

77
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,080
 Over many decades of service to the Canadian people, I have come to understand and appreciate

78
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,840
 the importance of open, transparent government and the power of truth as antidote to the

79
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,200
 many afflictions the body politic is heir to.

80
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:37,440
 The true currency of the 21st century will not be gold or silver or a basket of currencies,

81
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,320
 however useful they may be.

82
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,400
 It will be trust.

83
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,320
 Without that commodity, progress and right action are undermined and delayed.

84
00:07:49,320 --> 00:08:00,360
 There is only one way to regain trust, find and tell the truth.

85
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,400
 (Applause.)

86
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,920
 Whether to your friends or family or to the citizens of nations, I believe this citizens

87
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:19,940
 hearing serves that purpose, and like my friend, Edgar Mitchell, I say without equivocation,

88
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,640
 we are not alone in the cosmos.

89
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,160
 We have neighbors.

90
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,720
 We should try to get to understand them and to cooperate with them.

91
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
 Thank you.

92
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
 (Applause.)

93
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:44,520
 I think it was about 33 years ago I was camping in West Virginia on a mountain 4,000 feet

94
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
 high.

95
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,280
 I got up in the middle of the night and went out and I just couldn't believe what I saw.

96
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,340
 The stars looked so darn close it looked like I could reach up and touch them.

97
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,080
 And there really was a Milky Way.

98
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
 I can't see it here.

99
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
 There is too much pollution.

100
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,280
 There is way too many lights here to see the Milky Way.

101
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,000
 We're just one star, a fairly mediocre star in the Milky Way.

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,720
 If the Milky Way was the United States, we're a fairly mediocre star somewhere in South

103
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,060
 Georgia.

104
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,680
 And there are a million other galaxies out there, a billion perhaps out there like ours.

105
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,000
 You have to be very arrogant and very presumptive to believe that this -- I'm a scientist.

106
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I got my Ph.D. 66 years ago.

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,480
 You have to be very arrogant and presumptive to believe that this is the only place where

108
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,520
 life exists in a universe this large.

109
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,000
 So I'm really looking forward to the testimony today.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,640
 Thank you all very much for being here.

111
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
 (Applause.)

112
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:47,160
 So I'd like to acknowledge we're running about 13 minutes late.

113
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:54,440
 If we could have Ms. Hell, Mr. Dolan, Mr. Friedman, and Mr. Cameron come forward.

114
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,000
 And in a moment I have the distinct honor of administering the oath.

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,560
 And gentlemen and Ms. Hell, if you'd like to repeat after me, I do hereby affirm --

116
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,760
 >> I do hereby affirm -- >> -- that I will tell the truth --

117
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,320
 >> -- that I will tell the truth -- >> -- and nothing but the truth --

118
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,360
 >> -- and nothing but the truth -- >> -- to the members of this committee today

119
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,200
 -- >> -- to the members of this committee today.

120
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
 >> Thank you.

121
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,440
 I believe we're scheduled to begin with Mr. Dolan.

122
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,800
 >> Esteemed members of the committee, thank you for having me.

123
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,880
 I'm a researcher and historian on the matter of UFOs, particularly as they relate to U.S.

124
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,000
 national security policy.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,520
 I just have a short statement here.

126
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:52,360
 The UFO problem has involved military personnel around the world for more than 60 years, and

127
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,400
 it is wrapped in secrecy.

128
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,200
 Because this subject is so widely ridiculed, it's important to stress why it's worthy of

129
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,760
 serious attention.

130
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,660
 Stories of strange objects in the sky actually go far back in time, but from the 1940s to

131
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,760
 our own era, military personnel from the United States and many other nations have encountered

132
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:23,360
 unidentified flying objects, visually or on radar or both, sometimes at close range.

133
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,200
 These events happen not scores of times, but hundreds of times, perhaps thousands.

134
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,280
 Sometimes the encounter was nothing more than a solid radar return of an object moving at

135
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,320
 an incomprehensible speed, performing impossible maneuvers.

136
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,440
 Sometimes it included the violation of sensitive airspace.

137
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,200
 Often it involved the dispatch of one or more aircraft to intercept the object.

138
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,680
 At times, crew members have claimed to see a metallic disc-like object, sometimes with

139
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,040
 portholes, sometimes with lights, frequently engaged in what appeared to be intelligent

140
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,320
 evasive maneuvers.

141
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:12,080
 In very few cases, it appears to have involved the military retrieval of a UFO.

142
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,560
 In a few others, it involved injury and even death to military personnel.

143
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,440
 And in a very large number of recorded instances, military personnel who encountered UFOs were

144
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,120
 adamant that they did not see a natural phenomenon.

145
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,840
 This is clearly a serious development and it has been treated as such by those groups

146
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,120
 charged with maintaining national security.

147
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,480
 The CIA, the NSA, and all branches of military intelligence have historically received UFO

148
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,200
 reports and discussed the matter as something of serious concern.

149
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,760
 And yet, the military and other branches of government have created the fiction for public

150
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,240
 consumption only that the UFO problem is nothing to be concerned about, certainly not the result

151
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,840
 of little green men.

152
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,960
 We are fortunate that starting in the 1970s, the US Freedom of Information Act began to

153
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,200
 help researchers learn some of the truth that lay behind the facade of propaganda.

154
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,280
 We learned, for example, that some US military analysts initially feared that the Soviet

155
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,760
 Union might be behind the flying saucer wave of the 1940s and '50s.

156
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,760
 They studied this possibility but rejected it.

157
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,720
 They also rejected the possibility that these were secret American technology.

158
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,680
 And indeed, options quickly narrowed.

159
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,440
 Either this was something real and alien or it was something conventional, but as yet

160
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,520
 unknown or unexplained.

161
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,000
 Already by the end of 1947, a contingent of analysts at the Air Technical Intelligence

162
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,680
 Center, ATIC, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, believed that UFOs were extraterrestrial.

163
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,760
 And by the summer of 1948, that team prepared what they called an estimate of the situation,

164
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,640
 stating the extraterrestrial hypothesis.

165
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,960
 The response?

166
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,900
 The team was dispersed and reassigned.

167
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:23,600
 Yet thanks to FOIA and the courage of a few senior officials to go on the record, we have

168
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,840
 a collection of statements about UFOs that are so numerous as to be impossible to mention

169
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,240
 all of them here.

170
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,400
 But a few might give you an appropriate flavor of what I mean.

171
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:42,240
 Here is one from General Robert B. Landry, Air Force aide to President Harry S. Truman.

172
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,000
 Landry says in an oral history interview given about 40 years ago, "I was called one afternoon

173
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 in 1948 to come to the Oval Office.

174
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,280
 The President wanted to see me.

175
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,800
 I was directed to report quarterly to the President after consulting with central intelligence

176
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:07,880
 people as to whether or not any UFO incidents received by them could be considered as having

177
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,400
 any strategic threatening implications."

178
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,200
 Landry went on to say that he continued to brief President Truman in conjunction with

179
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,680
 the CIA quarterly for the rest of the Truman presidency.

180
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,680
 That's no less than 16 briefings.

181
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,140
 We might want to know why a man as busy as President Truman was, why he would take the

182
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,400
 time out of his schedule to have so many meetings about UFOs, and yet we have no official transcript

183
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,440
 or record of those briefings.

184
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,960
 This is a statement from a top secret 1948 Air Force intelligence report called Analysis

185
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:52,840
 of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S., "The frequency of reported sightings, the similarity

186
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,320
 in many of the characteristics attributed to the observed objects, and the quality of

187
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,360
 observers considered as a whole, support the contention that some type of flying object

188
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,000
 has been observed.

189
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,800
 The origin of the devices is not ascertainable."

190
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,880
 And just two more quotations here I want to give you, an Air Force intelligence report

191
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,080
 from 1951 relating to an aerial encounter by a U.S. fighter pilot.

192
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,840
 "Described as flat on top and bottom and appearing from a front view to have round edges and

193
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,600
 slightly beveled," quite a bit of detail there, "no vapor trails or exhaust or visible means

194
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,880
 of propulsion described as traveling at tremendous speed."

195
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,140
 And one more quote from the early years, this one from a former head of the CIA, Roscoe

196
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:50,220
 Hillencutter, speaking in 1960, "Behind the scenes, high ranking Air Force officers are

197
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:57,760
 soberly concerned about UFOs, but through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens

198
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,080
 are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense."

199
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:09,080
 Now how much clearer a statement should responsible citizens, academicians, media, and political

200
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:16,400
 leadership require before demanding to get some reasonable answers as to what is going

201
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,520
 on behind the scenes in relation to the phenomenon of UFOs?

202
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,540
 Because the problem certainly did not end during the 1960s or 1970s or 1980s, but has

203
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,320
 continued to the present day.

204
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,240
 During the summer of 2002, just outside this city, over the town of Waldorf of Maryland,

205
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,080
 dozens of witnesses reported an incredible scene.

206
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,160
 Multiple jet fighters chasing multiple large unknown objects that were of blue and orange

207
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,080
 coloration.

208
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,960
 All the witnesses, two of whom I interviewed personally and several of whom spoke to national

209
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,720
 media, described the amazing performance and capability of these objects.

210
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,720
 The Air Force itself admitted that it had scrambled F-16s to investigate unknowns, which

211
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,040
 it also admitted it had tracked on at least one of these objects on radar.

212
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,360
 We also learned that the UFO simply disappeared from the radar.

213
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,880
 The Air Force conclusion was that it could have been "any number of things."

214
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,720
 Now perhaps we might like to know precisely which things.

215
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,480
 What blue object can descend at an 80 degree angle, stop, reverse course, and accelerate

216
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,360
 away from two F-16 jets near the nation's capital in post-9/11 America?

217
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,440
 It might be an interesting question to ponder.

218
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,200
 Over Chicago, O'Hare Airport.

219
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,760
 In November 2006, same kind of situation.

220
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,600
 A dozen United Airline employees, including at least one pilot while on the ground, saw

221
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,180
 a hovering disk-shaped object below the clouds.

222
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,040
 It then accelerated away so fast that it punched a hole through the cloud.

223
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,800
 United ordered its employees to silence, but one of them reported the event anyway.

224
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,440
 After denials by United and the FAA, both agencies were forced to acknowledge that indeed

225
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,520
 those people had made UFO reports.

226
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,840
 And again, we might ask, what might this have been over one of the busiest airports in the

227
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,160
 world and why the steadfast silence and denial?

228
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,040
 These are only some of the better known recent cases.

229
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,480
 There are, in fact, an overwhelming number of them.

230
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,060
 The two largest websites for collecting North American UFO reports, the National UFO Reporting

231
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:48,880
 Center and the Mutual UFO Network, have a combined total of well over 10,000 reports

232
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,640
 every year.

233
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
 Every year.

234
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,240
 Now, clearly many or most of these would turn out to be something prosaic if they were given

235
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,720
 an adequate investigation.

236
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,160
 But go through some of these reports.

237
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:08,360
 Many of them are truly incredible, and many of them have indeed received follow-up investigation.

238
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,000
 They are unexplained, and at least by our conventional wisdom, unexplainable.

239
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,840
 The combination of astonishing performance, powerful statements from selected senior officials,

240
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,200
 and unremitting silence and dismissal by our political establishment point to a problem.

241
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,160
 This is not merely the problem of cognitive dissonance.

242
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,580
 It is the problem of a political system in which the wheels have fallen off the machine.

243
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:44,000
 It is imperative, in the name of science and responsible public policy, that we get those

244
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,440
 wheels back on and begin a genuine, open investigation of this phenomenon.

245
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,240
 We demand, and deserve, answers from responsible officials who ought to be in the know.

246
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:04,000
 And if they're not in the know, we all need to investigate and find out just who is.

247
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:17,640
 Thank you.

248
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,880
 My name is Grant Cameron.

249
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,320
 I'm a private investigator.

250
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,120
 For the past 38 years, I have attempted to focus on what the highest levels of the U.S.

251
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,640
 government, military, and intelligence agencies know about the UFO phenomenon.

252
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,200
 I'm the director of the President's UFO website.

253
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,240
 As Steve Bassett mentioned, the Obama administration has come out with an official statement saying

254
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:49,320
 there is no ET evidence for an interaction with ET's and there is no cover-up.

255
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,840
 What I would like to do, based on my years of research, is present a few pieces of evidence

256
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,860
 which show that this statement, written by a low-level White House staffer, is ill-informed

257
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,360
 and not true.

258
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,360
 Mr. Dolan pointed out that President Truman had been briefed for five years orally on

259
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,800
 the subject of UFOs that does not appear in the official record.

260
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:21,520
 I'd like to add that Truman, on video, does make a statement stating, "Yes, we discussed

261
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,360
 it at every conference we had with the military.

262
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,320
 There are always things like that going on, flying saucers and other such things."

263
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:39,320
 In 1969, the U.S. government officially shut down its official UFO investigation, stating

264
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,960
 that there was no evidence that UFOs were extraterrestrial and therefore they were out

265
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
 of the business.

266
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,520
 If this were true, the government would have shut up and allowed the subject to fade into

267
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,940
 history.

268
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,680
 This is not, however, what happened.

269
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,940
 Only three years after shutting down their program, the U.S. Air Force, at the direction

270
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,760
 of the Secretary of the Air Force, contacted two documentary film producers who signed

271
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,600
 an official film contract at the Pentagon to do a documentary on UFOs.

272
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,720
 They were provided with a number of films and pictures, including a film of extraterrestrials

273
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:27,520
 landing at Holloman Air Force Base, of which they used eight seconds in the final production.

274
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,400
 They were given another film, marked "Top Secret," that was never returned and is still

275
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,280
 in their possession.

276
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:44,080
 The documentary was funded with $250,000 and they were asked not to source the funder of

277
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,360
 the money in the credits.

278
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,720
 A CIA agent was present through the entire production, and as Linda Howe can testify,

279
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,800
 she saw a letter to one of the producers from President Richard Nixon thanking him for his

280
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,840
 cooperation on the project.

281
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:07,600
 Former Senator Barry Goldwater wrote extensively on UFOs, such as in 1975 when he wrote about

282
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,980
 his friend General Curtis LeMay, who refused him access in 1964 to the Blue Room at Wright

283
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:23,000
 Patterson Air Force Base, where alien hardware and bodies were rumored to have been held.

284
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,120
 Goldwater wrote, "I made an effort to find out what was in that building at Wright Patterson

285
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,580
 Air Force Base, and I was understandably denied this request.

286
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,440
 It is still classified above Top Secret."

287
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,840
 As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Goldwater continued to answer UFO letters,

288
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,560
 stating in one letter, "This thing has gotten so highly classified, it is impossible to

289
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,720
 get anything on it."

290
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,740
 In another letter, Goldwater wrote, "I have no idea who controls the flow of need to know

291
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:04,240
 because, frankly, I was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that I've

292
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,000
 never tried to make it my business since."

293
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,400
 And finally, Goldwater wrote, "I have been interested in this subject for a long time,

294
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,120
 and I know that whatever the Air Force has on this subject is going to remain highly

295
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,400
 classified."

296
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,680
 Those waiting for the president to stand up and say ETs are here should know that that

297
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,800
 event occurred on June the 27th, 1981.

298
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,320
 Steven Spielberg stated that after the screening of ET, the extraterrestrial, in the White

299
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:42,280
 House Theatre, Reagan "just stood up and looked around the room, almost like he was doing

300
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,000
 a head count.

301
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,600
 And he said, 'I want to thank you for bringing ET to the White House.

302
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,720
 We really enjoyed your movie.'

303
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,600
 And then he looked around the room and he said, 'And there are a number of people in

304
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,540
 this room who know that everything on that screen is absolutely true.'"

305
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,920
 And Spielberg added, "And he said it without smiling."

306
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,200
 If you check the files of the Bush Library, you'll find nothing on UFOs.

307
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,560
 However, if you look at my files, you will find an audio of President Bush during the

308
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,680
 1988 campaign being asked about UFOs, in which he says, "I know some.

309
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,280
 I know a fair bit."

310
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,200
 Likewise, I have a video of Vice President Dan Quayle stating, "The alien situation is

311
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,040
 very interesting.

312
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,120
 We literally spent some time looking at this."

313
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,120
 In April 2001, I asked Vice President Dick Cheney if he had been ever briefed on the

314
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,760
 subject of UFOs while he was on the Diana Ream show here in Washington.

315
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,080
 Instead of Cheney stating that there were no credible ET evidence, Cheney replied, "If

316
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,620
 I had been briefed on that subject, it would probably be classified and I wouldn't be talking

317
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,240
 about it."

318
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,080
 Even President Obama has said things that run contrary to the statement put out by his

319
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,520
 own White House.

320
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:13,740
 This might be because neither he nor anybody in his office saw the petition on ET question

321
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:20,000
 despite the fact that over 12,000 people signed the petition addressed to the President.

322
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,120
 During a visit to Roswell, New Mexico in 2012, President Obama referred to the White House

323
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,200
 -- to the Roswell crash saying, "We're going to keep our secrets here."

324
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,400
 This raises the question, in light of the statement put out by his office that there

325
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,640
 is no ET cover-up, what secrets is President Obama referring to?

326
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,240
 Then during a White House tour, President Obama anticipated a question that actor Will

327
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,920
 Smith's son Jayden wanted to ask about the reality of extraterrestrials.

328
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,540
 When they arrived in the White House situation room, the President said to Jayden, "I know

329
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,560
 what you want to ask.

330
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,480
 You want to know about the aliens.

331
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,440
 I can neither conform nor deny that extraterrestrials have visited the Earth.

332
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,440
 But if they had, and if there had been a top-secret meeting on the subject, it would have occurred

333
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,800
 in this very room."

334
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,440
 Then there is the story of Area 51, covered by 19-time Emmy Award-winning investigative

335
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,800
 reporter George Knapp, who has spent years covering the story.

336
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:31,480
 Knapp stated that he has over two dozen witnesses who tell bits and pieces of a story of a captured

337
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:38,760
 live alien and extraterrestrial spacecraft that are being back-engineered on the Nevada

338
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,520
 test site.

339
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:50,400
 He has also revealed during interviews that he had a discussion with Senator Howard Cannon

340
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,020
 shortly before his death, and that Howard Cannon basically confirmed to him that he

341
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,680
 had talked to Goldwater and the stories were true.

342
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:04,820
 Knapp stated that six of his witnesses were threatened, which succeeded them from stopping

343
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,120
 them from going on camera.

344
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:16,080
 Finally, in July 2012, Chase Brandon, a 42-year veteran of the CIA, was a guest of the 2 million

345
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:23,200
 listeners of the overnight radio talk show called "Coast to Coast."

346
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,960
 His words on the ET cover-up were clear, as he referenced material he had seen at CIA

347
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,400
 headquarters.

348
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:37,040
 To quote Chase Brandon, "I absolutely know, as I sit here talking to you, that there was

349
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,100
 a craft beyond this world that crashed at Roswold, and that the military picked up the

350
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,720
 remains of not just a wreckage, but of cadavers.

351
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,600
 One hundred percent in my heart and soul," said Brandon, "Roswold happened.

352
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,040
 There was a craft and absolutely cadavers.

353
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,760
 I don't know where the stuff is, but I know that Roswold happened."

354
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:11,300
 Thank you.

355
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,280
 Thank you for inviting me here.

356
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:21,440
 As a retired nuclear physicist who has been studying the evidence about UFOs since 1958

357
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,400
 and since 1967 has given well over 700 lectures in all 50 states, 10 Canadian provinces and

358
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,840
 18 other countries, I've reached four major conclusions.

359
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,440
 One, the evidence is overwhelming that Earth is being visited by intelligently controlled

360
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,960
 extraterrestrial spacecraft.

361
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,280
 In other words, some, underlined 10 times, some UFOs are alien spacecraft.

362
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
 Most are not.

363
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
 Don't care about them.

364
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,080
 Two, there is no doubt that a small number of people within governments, both in the

365
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,720
 United States and overseas, have been actively covering up the truth about these visits.

366
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,600
 There really is a cosmic water gate.

367
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,800
 Three, there are no good arguments against these conclusions, only people who haven't

368
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,760
 studied the relevant evidence.

369
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,880
 And four, flying saucer visitations and the cosmic water gate represent the biggest story

370
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,480
 of the millennium.

371
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,920
 And I should say that I prefer the term flying saucer because all flying saucers are UFOs.

372
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,560
 Very few UFOs are flying saucers.

373
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,880
 All great-grandfathers are men, not all men are great-grandfathers.

374
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,360
 I'm interested in the flying saucers, not the UFOs.

375
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,960
 The basis for these conclusions, A, there are at least five large-scale scientific studies

376
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,220
 which provide substantial evidence.

377
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,880
 These include Project Blue Book Special Report Number 14, the largest study ever done for

378
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,640
 the United States Air Force, covering more than 3,200 cases with more than 200 charts,

379
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
 tables, graphs, and maps.

380
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,280
 It is quality evaluation, cross-comparison between unknowns and knowns.

381
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,640
 The official press release lied about the data, I'll document that in a minute, is almost

382
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,880
 never referenced by UFO debunkers.

383
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,880
 Dr. Carl Sagan, we were classmates at the University of Chicago, claimed there are interesting

384
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:22,120
 UFO sightings that are not reliable, and reliable UFO sightings that are not interesting.

385
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,360
 But there are no cases that are both reliable and interesting.

386
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:34,120
 This statement was not backed up by reference to data, but is directly contradicted by the

387
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,080
 Blue Book Special Report 14 data.

388
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,520
 It was found that the more reliable the case, the more likely to be unexplainable.

389
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,460
 United States Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles, in the very widely distributed press release

390
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:57,160
 when the 1955 study was completed, flat out lied, it's a strong statement and I'm sorry

391
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,720
 to make it, but it's true.

392
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,840
 He stated, "We believe that no objects such as those properly described as flying saucers

393
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,640
 have overflown the United States.

394
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,280
 Even the unknown 3% could have been identified as conventional phenomena or illusions if

395
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,680
 more complete observational data had been available."

396
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,680
 The fact of the matter in the report that he was talking about is that the unknowns

397
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:36,640
 comprise 21.5% of the cases completely separate from the 9.3% listed as insufficient information.

398
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,640
 The 3% number was a lie.

399
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,640
 Furthermore, a statistical comparison of the unknowns and knowns showed that the probability

400
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:52,800
 that the unknowns were just misknowns was less than 1%.

401
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,120
 It must further be noted that the press release did not give the title of the report or the

402
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,880
 company that did the work, Battelle Memorial Institute.

403
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,120
 If they'd given the title, surely some newsman would have said, "Hey, what happened to reports

404
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,560
 one through 13?"

405
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,920
 They'd never heard about them.

406
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,880
 The correct answer, had it been given, would have been that they were all classified.

407
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,440
 It's a very valuable source of information, this report.

408
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,840
 It's funny how the debunkers never talk about it.

409
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,280
 Another primary source of valuable data, which should be of interest to you all, are the

410
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:38,280
 congressional hearings of July 29, 1968, which included testimony from 12 scientists.

411
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,040
 The most important paper was by Dr. James E. McDonald, professor of physics at the University

412
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,400
 of Arizona.

413
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:51,160
 He had talked to 500 witnesses, but he presented 41 outstanding cases, including multiple witness

414
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:56,460
 radar visual sightings, sightings by pilots, by astronomers, by meteorologists.

415
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:03,360
 He noted physical trace cases of which, by now, more than 5,000 have been collected by

416
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,480
 Ted Phillips from 95 countries.

417
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,680
 They get dull, same thing was happening all over the world.

418
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,440
 Saucer is seen on the ground, it leaves, they find physical changes, happens here, it happens

419
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,840
 there, it happens everywhere.

420
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,800
 One-sixth of those cases involved reports of small beings associated with the craft

421
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,560
 while it was on the ground.

422
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,680
 I was the youngest contributor to those, and I think the only survivor since then, to those

423
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,680
 hearings in 1968.

424
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:44,480
 And I was the only one without a PhD, that might tell you something, I'm not sure what.

425
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,640
 The proceedings, incidentally, are still available online.

426
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,160
 One of the contributors was Dr. J. Allen Heineck, chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern

427
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,800
 University, and for 20 years, United States Air Force scientific consultant to Project

428
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,360
 Blue Book.

429
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,720
 His book, The UFO Experience, a Scientific Inquiry, should be required reading by anybody

430
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,080
 who's going to talk about flying saucers, especially negatively.

431
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,160
 According to another source here, according to a special UFO subcommittee of the American

432
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,840
 Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, world's largest group of space scientists,

433
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:28,560
 30% of the 117 cases studied by the University of Colorado, government-sponsored study in

434
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:36,600
 the late '60s, and discussed in the Condon Report, Edward U. Condon, could not be identified,

435
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,280
 and yet the headline said, "Scientific study shows no UFOs."

436
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,120
 Totally untrue.

437
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,400
 There's a two-volume report called the UFO Evidence, which has loads of data, hundreds

438
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,880
 of cases that couldn't be identified.

439
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,720
 There's also the Commedia Report from France, which goes into numerous excellent officially

440
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,940
 involved cases in France.

441
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,920
 There are a dozen PhD theses about UFOs.

442
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:15,200
 One of them demonstrating how poor the press coverage has been.

443
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:22,760
 I haven't seen one about coverage by the scientific community or coverage by the political committee.

444
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,200
 That's another story.

445
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,480
 Anybody need a PhD thesis topic?

446
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,240
 There's two good ones.

447
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,920
 Also a third one, the will not to believe on the part of scientists.

448
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,160
 It's a sickness, a disease, if you will, infecting people who think they know all there is to

449
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,560
 know and don't.

450
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:50,280
 A really bad example of bias and ignorance appeared in Astronomy Magazine this month,

451
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,460
 May 2013, by Dr. Phil Plait.

452
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,440
 He does a blog, Bad Astronomy.

453
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,080
 The title of the article, believe it or not, is The Science Behind UFOs, it's a cover story.

454
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,240
 He somehow manages to mention none of the five large-scale scientific studies that I've

455
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,660
 just talked about, or any of the 5,000 physical trace cases, or any multiple witness radar

456
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:20,620
 visual cases, or abductions nor advanced technology studies at national labs and an industry showing

457
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:29,000
 trips to nearby stars in reasonable round-trip times using fusion propulsion are feasible.

458
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,200
 I worked on fusion back in the early '60s.

459
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,840
 To give you a form of reference, every star in the universe or multiverse produces its

460
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,560
 energy by nuclear fusion.

461
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,760
 That's what H-bombs are all about.

462
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,480
 And a good demonstration of the atom and the UFO together, if you will, is that in a very

463
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:01,400
 short period we managed to go from a 10-ton blockbuster, World War II, 1945, took a big

464
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,080
 B-29 to carry it.

465
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:12,640
 That was in 1944, in 1945, the first A-bomb, 15,000 tons of TNT, not 10.

466
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,480
 Seven years later, which is nothing, cost a lot of money, we set off the first fusion

467
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,360
 device, an H-bomb, called Mike, incidentally.

468
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:29,960
 It released the energy of 10 million tons of TNT.

469
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,080
 So you go from 10 to 15,000 to 10 million tons.

470
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,240
 And the Russians sent off one that was 50 million tons of TNT.

471
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,460
 The point is we know how to get to the stars if we want to spend the money.

472
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,640
 I'm not saying it's the ultimate technology.

473
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,640
 I'm saying scientific progress comes from doing things differently in an unpredictable

474
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,840
 way.

475
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,800
 The future is not an extrapolation of the past.

476
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,240
 You have to change how you do things.

477
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:10,800
 And what gets to me, having worked on fusion propulsion, fission propulsion, nuclear reactors

478
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,400
 for space applications, and all the rest of this, is that we tend to forget that if you

479
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,360
 make enough stupid assumptions, you can prove almost anything is impossible.

480
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,720
 One quick example, one astronomer in 1941.

481
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,480
 He was fed up with all the science fiction stuff about going to the moon.

482
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
 That was nonsense, he said.

483
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,220
 So he published a scientific, in quotes, paper calculating the required initial launch weight

484
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,680
 of a rocket able to get a man to the moon and back.

485
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,000
 Legitimate question, how big is it got to be?

486
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,480
 Pages of equations, he concluded it would have to weigh a million, million tons.

487
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,800
 It was off by a factor of 300 million.

488
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,480
 Proving if you make enough stupid assumptions, you can prove anything is impossible.

489
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,360
 So we have reason to be very careful when somebody says something is impossible.

490
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:16,280
 I have a whole book, it's impossible, isn't it, was going to be the title, but science

491
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,240
 was wrong is what the publisher decided on.

492
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:30,040
 I like the first one better, but anyway, let's look at another progression, not only in bombs.

493
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,020
 Ferdinand Magellan's ship, he didn't make it, but his ship did, went around the planet

494
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:47,000
 in three years, in 1523, three years, three years before the mast, you might say.

495
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,160
 Science fiction writers had going around the world in 80 days in the 19th century.

496
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,440
 The space station goes around the world in 90 minutes.

497
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,320
 Progress comes from doing things differently.

498
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,200
 A second problem I have found, I worked under security for 14 years for major companies

499
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,760
 like GE, GM, Westinghouse, McDonald Douglas, TRW systems, aerogenerals, nucleonics, I set

500
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,680
 a record for working on cancelled government sponsored research and development programs.

501
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,640
 Not intentionally, you understand.

502
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,680
 Another one of the false myths is that governments can't keep secrets.

503
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,560
 Two astronomers have demonstrated this, Dr. Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute, S-E-T-I,

504
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:45,640
 that stands for Silly Effort to Investigate, incidentally, that's another story which I've

505
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:53,360
 written about in the book, said you can prove that the government can't keep secrets by

506
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:00,960
 how badly FEMA fouled up with Katrina and how poorly the post offices operated.

507
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,720
 If you can see a connection between either of those things and governments keeping secrets,

508
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,320
 I sure can't.

509
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:13,760
 He didn't mention the CIA, the DIA, the NRO, the NSA and all those other alphabet soup agencies.

510
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,720
 Another great astronomer, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, head of Hayden Planetarium, he said

511
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,920
 the proof that governments can't keep secrets is shown by how much we know about President

512
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,360
 Clinton's genitalia.

513
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:33,280
 Now if you can figure that one out you're better than I am.

514
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:41,640
 Now the proof, and I'll show some of this in my lecture Tuesday night, about government

515
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,820
 cover-up, it's not just an idle concept.

516
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:56,760
 If you wish you can get a hold of 156 top-secret Umbra NSA UFO documents.

517
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,680
 They're not very interesting because all you can read is one sentence per page.

518
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,800
 Everything else is whited out, not blacked out, they said that was too impressive on

519
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,920
 television when I used that, they told me this.

520
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,840
 And the reason is everything else is sources and methods.

521
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:21,540
 Twenty-eight percent sources and methods and two percent UFOs but it's filed under UFOs.

522
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,800
 Come on, that makes no sense.

523
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,920
 You can get a bunch of CIA, and I'll show some of these too, blacked out UFO documents.

524
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,040
 So highly redacted that you can read about six words per page.

525
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:42,880
 And my favorite thing, and it took me three years to get this, was one of the CIA UFO

526
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,880
 documents that says on the top, "Deny in Toto."

527
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,480
 They couldn't find six lousy words to declassify.

528
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,760
 Something's wrong here.

529
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,560
 I have to tell you, one minute, okay, I won't tell you, maybe I'll tell you that Tuesday

530
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,280
 night.

531
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,360
 One more thing, Air Force General Carroll Bolander stated that UFO reports which could

532
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,480
 affect national security.

533
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:21,840
 He was asked to look about what we should do about Project Blue Book, are not part of

534
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,520
 the Blue Book system.

535
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:31,160
 UFO reports which could affect national security are not part of the Blue Book system.

536
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,720
 Incredible statement.

537
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,960
 I located him, I talked to him on the phone, he verified there are two separate reporting

538
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,960
 channels.

539
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,480
 He never heard that from the Air Force.

540
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,160
 His job was to decide what to do about Project Blue Book, and it was canceled because of

541
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,160
 this memo.

542
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:52,920
 But the public never heard that he said, "Reports which could affect national security are not

543
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,760
 part of the Blue Book system."

544
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
 People are surprised.

545
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,040
 Just one more sentence here, two sentences.

546
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,680
 I've won several debates on UFOs.

547
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,920
 I've only had 11 hecklers and over 700 lectures.

548
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,440
 It's past time for the press, scientific and political communities to do their homework.

549
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,880
 And I should add at least three UFO crashes have occurred.

550
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,560
 You'll hear more about those later in these hearings.

551
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:36,880
 Thank you very much.

552
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,080
 Chairman Bartlett and distinguished Citizen Hearing on Disclosure panelists and my hearing

553
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,880
 colleagues, my name is Linda Moulton Howe.

554
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:54,300
 I grew up in Boise, Idaho where my father, Chet Moulton, was Director of Aeronautics.

555
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,160
 One of his friends was Kenneth Arnold, who reported the unidentified flying objects over

556
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,480
 Mount Rainier in June of 1947.

557
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:11,720
 And a local reporter then coined the phrase UFO, unidentified flying objects.

558
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:17,560
 I remember my father dismissed the idea of extraterrestrials altogether and that is the

559
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,280
 bias with which I grew up.

560
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,360
 I attended the University of Colorado in Boulder when I earned a cum laude Bachelor of Arts

561
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,520
 in English Literature.

562
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,360
 And I went on to Stanford University in California to earn a master's degree in communication

563
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:39,120
 producing documentary films for the Stanford Medical Center.

564
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,920
 My master's thesis film was about the Stanford Linear Accelerator's first efforts to have

565
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,620
 computers analyze subatomic particle bombardments.

566
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:58,600
 From Stanford I went to TV news at KNBC in Los Angeles where my beat was science, environment

567
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,560
 and medicine.

568
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:07,840
 Later I was honored at WCVB in Boston as a producer sharing the station's Peabody Award

569
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,640
 for Science and Medical Programming Excellence.

570
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:18,720
 Then I became Director of Special Projects at the Denver CBS affiliate, KMGH-TV.

571
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:26,540
 I produced, wrote, directed, edited and reported a dozen TV documentaries about several live

572
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:32,400
 issues in the Colorado area and produced studio shows about science, medical and environmental

573
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,840
 issues that earned three regional Emmys, one national Emmy nomination and several other

574
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,360
 documentary film awards.

575
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:46,680
 I stress this only to say that when people address the mainstream media and those that

576
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:53,240
 are professionals not paying attention to this very important issue, that is not true.

577
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,720
 Many of us have tried.

578
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:02,240
 One of my documentaries was an investigation of the strange bloodless, trackless mutilations

579
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,680
 of animals ranging from cattle and horses to goats, sheep, pigs and rabbits and even

580
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,520
 wild animals such as deer, elk and a marmot.

581
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,700
 Many of you may not know that the United States Forestry Department for decades has had photographs,

582
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:26,480
 I've seen them with my own eyes, of deer and elk with the ear, the eye, the tongue,

583
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,200
 the jaw flesh, the genitals and the rectum cored out, all bloodless, but that is also

584
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:38,640
 kept as a top secret unless a reporter like myself ends up getting a leak from somebody

585
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,320
 who is inside the forestry department and shows me the photos.

586
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:52,460
 Now these mutilations at the time that I was in Colorado in 1979 have been appearing in

587
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:59,080
 a series of repeated cycles since the early 1960s and I came to learn that they were not

588
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:04,200
 confined to Colorado, but they were all over the United States, Canada and other parts

589
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,200
 of the world.

590
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,240
 The first research interview that I did for that animal mutilation documentary was with

591
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,140
 former Logan County Sheriff Tex Graves.

592
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:22,340
 He told me bluntly on my first meeting with him, "The perpetrators of animal mutilations

593
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,880
 are creatures from outer space."

594
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,360
 But he would not go on the record in front of a camera and say those words for a public

595
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,920
 to see.

596
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,760
 He said, "You will have to get somebody else to tell you that truth."

597
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:46,280
 And in fact, a few ranchers told me about beams of light from rounder glowing objects

598
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:52,360
 in the sky that they had seen with their own eyes pick up cattle from a pasture or lure

599
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:58,520
 an animal to a pasture, dead with the same bloodless excisions.

600
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:06,480
 The beam transport would explain why there are no tracks, not even the animals own tracks

601
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,520
 around bodies that are found on dusty pastures that have no grass.

602
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:19,680
 The animals are found in what is equivalent to face powder with no tracks around a 2,000

603
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:28,840
 pound or 1,800 pound animal that has an ear, eye, tongue, jaw flesh, genitals and rectum removed

604
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,420
 without any blood.

605
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:37,120
 The documentary that I produced, A Strange Harvest, was awarded a regional Emmy.

606
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:43,580
 Home Box Office in New York City later contacted me to follow up on A Strange Harvest with

607
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:51,000
 an hour special for HBO with a working title, UFOs, the ET Factor.

608
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,080
 A contract was signed and New York attorney Peter Gerstin, who filed the first freedom

609
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:04,400
 of information request back at the end of the 1970s for information about UFOs and his

610
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:14,400
 filing went to the CIA, the NSA, the DIA, the NRO, and other military offices.

611
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,400
 He arranged for me to have a meeting at Curlin Air Force Base in Albuquerque.

612
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:25,580
 Mr. Gerstin had received correspondence from an agent at the U.S. Air Force Office of Special

613
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:31,720
 Investigations about a dramatic landing of a disk and humanoid entities at Ellsworth

614
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,880
 Air Force Base in South Dakota.

615
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:41,080
 I was to go to a meeting at Curlin Air Force Base and get the names, addresses, and phone

616
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:46,720
 numbers of some of the eyewitnesses of an exchange between our military security and

617
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,520
 something from this landed disk.

618
00:52:50,520 --> 00:53:00,360
 But instead, the agent took out of a desk drawer pages, a document of sorts, and handed

619
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:06,040
 them to me saying, "My superiors have asked me to show this to you.

620
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,920
 You can read it.

621
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,960
 You can ask me questions, but you cannot have this paper."

622
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,520
 And he ordered me to sit in the middle of the room in order to read the document that

623
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,040
 he was handing me.

624
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:26,760
 Later, I learned that I had been both videotaped, audio taped, and photographed sitting in that

625
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:33,520
 chair reading that briefing paper and the responses and questions that I had to the

626
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:41,920
 AFOSI agent at the Curlin AFOSI office that day, April 9, 1983.

627
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:47,980
 The document had a title all caps on a front page, quote, "Briefing paper for the President

628
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,620
 of the United States on the subject of unidentified aerial craft."

629
00:53:52,620 --> 00:54:00,080
 And in this document, the phrase unidentified aerial vehicles was also used, UACs and UAVs

630
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,300
 instead of UFOs.

631
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:08,680
 The document gave a history of the U.S. government's history of retrieval of crashed or landed

632
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:17,120
 craft in Roswell, Aztec, and Magdalena, New Mexico, northern Arizona, and northern Mexico

633
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:23,960
 south of Laredo, Texas, and a second series of one or more crashes in the Roswell area

634
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,480
 in 1949.

635
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,560
 The alleged presidential briefing paper also described information from a live extraterrestrial

636
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,760
 biological entity.

637
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:43,160
 The acronym is EBA, E-B-E, taken from a crash site near Roswell, New Mexico in 1949, two

638
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:51,960
 years after the historically famous 1947 July crashes of not disks, but my understanding

639
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:59,880
 is wedge-shaped craft that contained small humanoid bodies, both dead and alive.

640
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:06,160
 I was told that one of the first scientists brought in on autopsies of dead alien bodies

641
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,880
 was a herpetologist who studies snakes and reptiles.

642
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:18,440
 The skin and eyes of the nonhumans were described as scaled like a snake's body, and the eyes

643
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,900
 had vertical slit pupils beneath dark protective lenses.

644
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:34,120
 Since April 9, 1983, I have witnesses and physical evidence that support that alleged

645
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,900
 presidential briefing paper shown to me at Kirtland Air Force Base, and I have been reporting

646
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,700
 about the hardest facts and evidence that I have been able to muster as an investigative

647
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:51,360
 reporter since then for television, for radio, and for books that I have done.

648
00:55:51,360 --> 00:56:02,120
 Today on April 29, 2013, 30 years later, as a longtime TV producer and investigative reporter

649
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:09,040
 who produces the science and environment website, earthfiles.com, and also reports monthly for

650
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:15,960
 premier radio networks broadcast of Coast to Coast AM in Los Angeles, I can, before

651
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,920
 you today, assert that the pressure of facts accumulated from military and intelligent

652
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:29,760
 eyewitnesses, from ranchers and pathologists, from pilots and astronauts, from fellow human

653
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,880
 experiencers in the UFO abduction syndrome, and from leaks by scientists and computer

654
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:42,400
 experts who have worked on back engineering extraterrestrial technologies extracted from

655
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:49,160
 non-human craft, there is no doubt that the United States government since World War II

656
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:55,320
 and the FDR and Truman administrations has known about the extraterrestrial interactions

657
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:01,160
 with earth and that their policies of denial in the alleged interest of national security

658
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,280
 are still in effect.

659
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:10,760
 My greatest challenge as a journalist is to get on the record what I am told by military

660
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:16,680
 and intelligence agents and other eyewitnesses on the record.

661
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,720
 National security in what is supposed to be a democratic government of, for, and by the

662
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,360
 people is not served by lies and secrecy.

663
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:33,200
 Every American and the whole world deserves the truth about non-humans past, present,

664
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,740
 and future interacting with this planet.

665
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:40,360
 Thank you.

666
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:51,800
 If I have done the time calculations correctly, we now have about five to six minutes for

667
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:56,680
 each of the six members of the committee to engage in questions with the panelists.

668
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:03,000
 As is my custom as a co-chair, I will reserve my questions till the end.

669
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,600
 I've always done that in the Congress.

670
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:13,560
 If my questions have been asked by my colleagues, I will simply thank the witnesses.

671
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:25,880
 So Mr. Dolan, I have a question, I wrote it, personal experience, have you had personal

672
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:31,840
 experience in this regard?

673
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:36,220
 I don't really know if any personal experience I've had is particularly noteworthy.

674
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:43,880
 On two occasions in my life, I saw what I think might be vaguely considered a UFO.

675
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:49,920
 Most interesting, many years ago with my son who was a small boy, I was holding his hand

676
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:57,120
 in a bright blue, perfectly blue sky, I saw an object that was quite unusual, brighter

677
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,840
 than anything I'd ever seen in the sky other than the sun and he was very small.

678
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:08,600
 He watched me staring at this thing, silent and wondering what happened to dad?

679
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:13,440
 And I turned to reassure him for one moment and I looked back literally one second later

680
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,440
 and the thing was gone.

681
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,200
 I have no idea what it was, that's really never been my motivation for studying this.

682
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:27,880
 I fell into this topic about 20 years ago while doing dissertation work on US national

683
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:34,480
 security circa 1950 and just stumbled into the topic of UFOs and I guess you could call

684
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,880
 it an obsession ever since.

685
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:48,180
 So why do you think, I mean I know it's opinion so we get this, why the steadfast silence

686
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:51,320
 and denial, what's the risk?

687
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:56,680
 I think the implications are vastly, very profound.

688
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:02,540
 If we try to rewind the clock 60 plus years back to the 1940s and just imagine, just pretend

689
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:06,960
 for the moment that it actually happened because many of us I think it did, that an event say

690
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:15,360
 at Roswell happened or maybe elsewhere or other types of grave violations of airspace

691
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,360
 were going on.

692
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,840
 If we think back to the very post World War II era, the world was in a state of flat on

693
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,240
 its back trying to get back, there were millions of homeless people around the world, people

694
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,560
 on the brink of starvation in the early Cold War.

695
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:34,600
 It was not a stable time and one would have to assume the last thing any president would

696
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:40,840
 be interested in doing would be to say to the world, well we have this other phenomenon

697
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,840
 here too.

698
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,960
 We don't know who these people are, we don't really know if they're friendly or hostile.

699
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,800
 How can you tell the world that you have this under control when you yourself don't really

700
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,680
 know the full implications of what this is?

701
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:57,040
 So I think the logical thing that would have been done and in particular if anything was

702
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,400
 recovered because this is key.

703
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,960
 If one of your top scientists or generals approaches you and says sir we've recovered

704
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,320
 this exotic technology that's not from our civilization and if you tell the world you

705
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:12,200
 have it, now you've got the specter of the Soviet Union, it becomes very difficult not

706
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,200
 to share this technology.

707
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:19,240
 The United States did not want to share atomic technology in 1947.

708
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,480
 Clearly why would they want to share something as exotic as ET technology or whatever.

709
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,360
 Well okay, but this is the 21st century now.

710
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:33,760
 Right, so what I think what happened is simply that secrecy becomes secret, it becomes profitable.

711
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,880
 It develops its own reason to be.

712
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:46,840
 It develops its own kind of logic and I also think that much of it has sort of gone away

713
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:53,660
 from formal government channels and seems to become increasingly privatized.

714
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,760
 So do I have time, any more time?

715
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,640
 Okay, one more quick question.

716
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,480
 Mr. Cameron, six witnesses threatened.

717
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,160
 How were they threatened and who threatened them?

718
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,560
 I'll give you an example of a couple of the witnesses.

719
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:19,960
 One witness was a woman who was a Steno for a military contractor who had been involved

720
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,160
 in discussions when it appears material was being moved from Wright-Patterson Air Force

721
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,940
 Base to Area 51.

722
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:32,640
 She was in on these meetings and she had agreed to go on camera with George Knapp after the

723
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:39,040
 story started to break in 1989, she was visited by two officers the same day she was going

724
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,640
 to go on camera and they said we just want to remind you, you have a security clearance,

725
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,120
 you're still under oath.

726
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:51,680
 We know that you and your daughter travel back and forth between Las Vegas and Los Angeles.

727
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,480
 There's a lot of desert out there.

728
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,280
 We would not want to have something happen in the desert.

729
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,360
 George Knapp told me personally this woman is so scared that 20 years later she's still

730
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,160
 will not talk about it.

731
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:09,520
 They had witnesses at Nellis Air Force Base, the golf instructor at Nellis Air Force Base,

732
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,880
 the golf pro, the guy who did the taxes for the generals.

733
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,800
 They had gotten to know all the generals and had been told the stories about the fact that

734
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,700
 the crafts were at Area 51, this is all for true.

735
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:27,840
 One of the key witnesses is a guy by the name of Alfred O'Donnell who the Appropriations

736
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,620
 Committee at Congress actually tried to talk to this guy.

737
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,400
 He was one of the highest ranking people at Area 51.

738
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,000
 George Knapp had a number of witnesses and he figured that he wanted to track down this

739
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,680
 Alfred O'Donnell, figured if anybody knew if the Area 51 crash saucer stories were true

740
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,420
 it would be Alfred O'Donnell.

741
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:48,360
 He got to know him, he got to be sort of friends.

742
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,720
 He said he basically stalked this guy because this guy would know and basically went to

743
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:56,800
 the guy's house, he's an expert on nuclear weapons from 1947 on, wired a lot of the first

744
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:03,040
 nuclear weapons, and he was showing him test site photographs from the nuclear stuff and

745
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,040
 then he closed the book.

746
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,980
 He said, "You didn't come here to talk about that, did you?"

747
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,200
 And George said, "No, I didn't come here to talk about that."

748
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,400
 He said, "You came here to talk about UFOs, didn't you?"

749
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,400
 And George said, "Yeah, that's why I'd like to know about it."

750
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,020
 And he said, "Well," and George said, "It took six months to get this guy to talk."

751
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:22,200
 And the guy bit by piece, he wasn't allowed to tape, he wasn't allowed to take notes,

752
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,600
 and in the end he basically said, "Yes, it's true."

753
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:34,440
 Area 51, we have the saucers there and George said, "Weren't you afraid that the story would

754
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,440
 get out?"

755
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,760
 He said, "No, we were afraid it would get out."

756
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,760
 He said, "What do you mean?

757
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,040
 You had an alien, it came all this way, you kept it captive."

758
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,400
 He said, "We didn't know what to do with it, we couldn't communicate with it."

759
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:50,320
 That is one of the highest level guys at the Area 51 site, is still alive, and a man who

760
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,360
 knows the whole story.

761
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,800
 >> Thank you, Ms. Kilfetrick.

762
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,640
 >> A few things, thank you very much for your testimony, very, very good, very good.

763
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,320
 Mr. Freeman, you were going to answer or add something to what Congressman Woolsey said,

764
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,880
 I'll give you that opportunity for a minute of my time if you'd like.

765
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,840
 >> Okay, I was going to recite six reasons for--

766
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,600
 >> Probably can't do six in a minute, give me a minute.

767
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,520
 >> Oh, sure you can, you want to figure out how the saucers work, you worry about the

768
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:21,040
 other guy figuring out how the saucers work, you worry about if an announcement would be

769
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,160
 made that the younger generation would push for an earthling orientation if we're told

770
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:31,180
 the planet's being visited, no government including ours wants that.

771
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:37,760
 We have the problem of Pat Robertson saying all the UFO stuff is the work of the devil,

772
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,120
 and all the intelligent life in the universe is here on planet Earth, I take issue with

773
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,120
 that.

774
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:48,960
 Finally, we have two special things, if they're coming here, some people say it's going to

775
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:54,440
 upset our whole technology, they've got things that will get rid of the oil industry, the

776
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,720
 car industry, plane industry, economic chaos.

777
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,160
 >> Reclaiming my time, thank you sir, thank you very much.

778
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:09,320
 Mr. Cameron, you mentioned that you are, and I'm assuming it's currently the President's

779
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:14,440
 Director of the President's UFO website, are you currently that?

780
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,440
 >> Yes.

781
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,080
 >> And that means for President Obama?

782
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:24,040
 >> No, I have a website that basically, my experience was I had a sighting, everybody

783
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,240
 was interested, but I basically wanted to find out who knew what was going on.

784
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:31,280
 I went up the chain of command, figured the President's the most powerful guy, this is

785
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,920
 one of the most important subjects, what does the President know?

786
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,400
 So what I've done, I have a website that accumulates all the stories of what the various Presidents

787
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,680
 have said, rumored stories and sightings, so that's what I've done, I have a site that

788
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,360
 deals with the Presidents and the subject of UFOs.

789
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,700
 >> Okay, so that's where I wanted you to explain that, first of all.

790
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,440
 So then does any of the Presidents, and what year did you establish that?

791
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,440
 Was that established?

792
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,440
 The website?

793
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,440
 >> It goes back about 15 years.

794
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,800
 >> Okay, so then the Presidents there, there are three or four, President Clinton, President

795
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,800
 Bush, one and two.

796
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,920
 >> I have the stories from all the Presidents.

797
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,720
 >> And do they acknowledge the website and have given you any support, or is it just

798
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,800
 like ooh, you can't talk about it?

799
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:17,080
 >> I've got no interaction with the White House, they have been on the site a few times,

800
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,080
 but no interaction.

801
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:21,240
 >> Okay, so it's for information for people of the world to access?

802
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,640
 >> For the public, because there's a lot of rumored stories, and I don't really say this

803
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,640
 is true, that's not true.

804
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,360
 There's a lot of rumored stories about various Presidents who have seen UFOs, what they've

805
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:33,520
 said about UFOs, and basically I just put it down so everybody can look at it.

806
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,760
 >> Okay, that's good information, we need that.

807
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,760
 Thank you, ma'am.

808
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,640
 It's always one woman that comes through for everything that we do, so we thank you for

809
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,040
 your different point of view and all of that as well.

810
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,400
 What do you do with all that information?

811
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:50,040
 You've seen it, you've read it in the middle of a room and photographed and all of that,

812
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,040
 what do you do?

813
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,760
 I mean, everybody becomes, we've got nuclear scientists and all of that at the table, are

814
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,760
 you frustrated?

815
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,280
 I mean, what are we going to do with this?

816
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:03,040
 It's a world phenomena, you all know better than I, we're kind of neophytes here except

817
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,840
 for the scientists here, you know, what do you do with it?

818
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,760
 Things like we're doing today in urgent Congress since 1968 has not had a hearing to do something

819
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:18,080
 else about it in the science committee that they did some 40 plus years ago, comment?

820
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:24,280
 >> My beat has always been science, environment, and medicine, it never changed.

821
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:30,000
 And it was getting into the animal mutilations and having the shock of law enforcement tell

822
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,760
 me that the perpetrators were creatures from outer space that was quite stunning.

823
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:41,360
 I did feel like I was Alice in Wonderland going through a mirror into a completely different

824
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,640
 reality than what we live in our nine to five daily lives.

825
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:53,600
 I produced the documentary that had a large broadcast in Colorado and the surrounding

826
01:08:53,600 --> 01:09:00,240
 states in 1980, May 25th, 1980 called A Strange Harvest.

827
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:07,000
 And after that as a professional working as director of special projects at the CBS station,

828
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:14,160
 I went on to do astronaut training in Colorado, Martin Marietta, and a thousand other subjects

829
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,040
 over the last 30 some years.

830
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:21,760
 >> So you are documented, you are, obviously people call on you so you're verified, by

831
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:26,720
 the way, the couple of the documentaries that you mentioned, are they available for our

832
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,160
 committee to each of us?

833
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:33,760
 >> Yes, all of my work is at my news website, earthfiles.com.

834
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,840
 It's always there, it's always available, I've done four books, several documentaries

835
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,840
 of which two are there.

836
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,040
 >> Which one or two would you give us, we can't read ten.

837
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,040
 >> A Strange Harvest.

838
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,040
 >> Okay, I wrote that.

839
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,440
 >> And A Strange Harvest, 1993.

840
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:53,640
 And those are the videos I would give you, the books too, that's an Alien Harvest, Glimpses

841
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,440
 of Other Realities, Volume One and Two, and Mysterious Life.

842
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,680
 >> Okay, but if we Googled your name we'd see all of that perhaps, right?

843
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,680
 >> Yes, earthfiles.com.

844
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,560
 >> And the only reason I'm rushing because five minutes goes quickly, I don't know if

845
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,560
 I'm out of time.

846
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,560
 >> Thirty seconds.

847
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,560
 >> Thirty seconds.

848
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,320
 Thank you for coming.

849
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,320
 >> Thank you.

850
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,320
 >> Okay.

851
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,320
 >> Thank you.

852
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:19,140
 >> Since, we're waiting for an answer of the next witness.

853
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:26,560
 >> With all due respect, let me correct, I pronounce it within my family Gravel.

854
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,560
 >> Gravel.

855
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,320
 >> It's a French name.

856
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,120
 >> Thank you.

857
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:39,240
 >> I want to associate my thoughts with Chairman Bartlett when he made the statement that it's

858
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:46,560
 the height of human arrogance to think that we are the only sentient human beings in the

859
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:56,200
 galaxies of the world that can think, that's human arrogance at its worst.

860
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,640
 What I'm struck with, with the testimony of all four of you and of course the readings

861
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:10,400
 that we had with preparing for this hearing, is the fact of secrecy itself, you know, why

862
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,480
 do we need this secrecy?

863
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,640
 And I'm asking this question to all four of you, what threats do you think exist to the

864
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:23,240
 national security that warrants this kind of security, this kind of an approach?

865
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,240
 Please.

866
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:31,480
 >> I started to say before, I can see six reasons for our government and other governments

867
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,720
 to keep things classified.

868
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,360
 First you want to figure out how they work, they make wonderful weapons delivery and defense

869
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,400
 systems and with the Cold War going on, if you do have wreckage and you want to figure

870
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,920
 out something, you're not going to want to tell your enemies.

871
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:52,800
 The second problem is what if they figure out how they work before you do?

872
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,320
 You don't want them to know, you know, they know, weapon, counter weapon, counter, counter

873
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,640
 weapon, we've been playing this game a long time.

874
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:05,480
 The third problem is if there were an announcement, I say by highly trusted individuals it's a

875
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,800
 little hard to find them around the planet, but my favorite odd couple is the Pope and

876
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,800
 the Queen.

877
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,640
 They're about the same age or they were until recently anyway.

878
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,280
 If they were to make an announcement that indeed UFOs are visiting, the planet's being

879
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,680
 visited, what would happen?

880
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,920
 Church attendance would go up, mental hospital admissions would go up, the stock market would

881
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:30,960
 go down, but I think based on 600 college lectures at the younger generation, which

882
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,440
 unlike me and probably you wasn't alive when there wasn't a space program.

883
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,720
 There was strong sentiment against space travel back not too many years ago.

884
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,360
 The younger generation would push for an earthling orientation.

885
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:49,080
 Let's face it from an alien viewpoint, we are all earthlings, Terrans as the science

886
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,960
 fiction writers would say.

887
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,720
 I know of no government on this planet that wants its people to owe their allegiance to

888
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,720
 the planet instead of that individual government.

889
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,640
 As far as I can tell, nationalism is the only game in town.

890
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:08,960
 There are some religious problems, extremists who say we're the only intelligent life in

891
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,320
 the universe and their followers don't want any part of visitors from outer space.

892
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,920
 He can't be.

893
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:22,360
 Planet was created in 4004 BC instead of 4 billion in 4 BC.

894
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:32,200
 A final thing, I have 7 times heard of cases in which pilots were scrambled to chase UFOs.

895
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:39,240
 There was a regulation issue, shoot them down if they don't land when instructed to do so

896
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,040
 when 7 pilots didn't come back.

897
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:47,360
 These were quiet discussions, these were not big public things.

898
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,840
 And if I've heard 7, there are a lot more cases like that.

899
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:58,760
 There were 200 fatal military plane crashes between 1951 and '56, including 5 where the

900
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:04,920
 pilots had over 100 missions in Korea where there were MiGs trying to shoot them down.

901
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,360
 That's a pretty good pilot to survive that.

902
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:14,560
 Comes back to the United States, no MiGs and his plane, as the New York Times said, disintegrated

903
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:20,400
 or disappeared, two strange terms to use in this context.

904
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,720
 So no families were told anything about that.

905
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:34,160
 And it won't come as a shock to you, but there were 166 Air Force guys on board reconnaissance

906
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:40,180
 planes that were tickling North Korea, Russia, and China right after the war.

907
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:45,400
 See how quickly the radar came on, what frequency they used and all that sort of stuff.

908
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:49,240
 166 wind up in planes that were shot down.

909
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,800
 Not one word in public about that.

910
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,920
 Families were not told until 2001 where a meeting was called and the medals were given

911
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,720
 out and an explanation was given.

912
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:03,600
 I say that only because a lot of people think, well, certainly they would have told the families

913
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,700
 those 7 planes.

914
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:12,920
 So that's an area of concern, I think, to admit that we can't do anything about these

915
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:13,920
 guys.

916
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:20,040
 But powerlessness is not something that attracts people to government.

917
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:24,360
 >> May I add a very quick follow-up in not taking a lot of time?

918
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:28,760
 I talked earlier about why I think that the possession of certain radical technology would

919
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,680
 have initiated some of the secrecy.

920
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:36,040
 Also, I think the need to maintain some level of social control, not knowing what these

921
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,680
 other beings were, at least in the early years.

922
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:44,400
 But I think what happens is once a secret goes on for long enough, it becomes a real

923
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,040
 nightmare to kind of contain.

924
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,920
 I can only imagine the difficulty that President Obama would face if he were somehow to make

925
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,920
 this announcement.

926
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,160
 I mean, really.

927
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:58,360
 If he were to -- if something were to force him to make an admission that, yes, these

928
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:03,760
 UFOs, apparently at least some of them are real, what does he then say at this press

929
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,260
 conference?

930
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:09,040
 I know what he'd like to say, which is, well, thanks everyone, I'm going on a vacation for

931
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,880
 about six months.

932
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,440
 Because there are a lot of follow-up questions that would be, frankly, very uncomfortable

933
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,760
 for him to deal with.

934
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,800
 I think one of the questions that most responsible journalists would want to ask is how on earth

935
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,240
 were you guys able to keep this secret for over 60 years?

936
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,720
 How did you do it?

937
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:33,320
 And the implications for getting into that whole issue are a nightmare.

938
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:40,320
 Was it you starting to deal with, has there been some level of control over the mainstream

939
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,480
 major media academic community?

940
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:50,120
 In fact, there are many off-the-shelf academic studies that show intelligence community influence

941
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,920
 over our major journalism and over our major academic communities.

942
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,200
 It's not a big secret.

943
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,560
 It's a longstanding relationship.

944
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,740
 But there would be some very deep questions to ask about that, about the nature of special

945
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:06,920
 access programs and unacknowledged special access programs and the primordial black budget.

946
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:12,760
 All of these would now become the target of citizen inquiry.

947
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:19,600
 And I believe firmly that an admission on this topic, in addition to all of the scientific

948
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:27,640
 and existential issues that it raises, also gets into just some nasty concrete political

949
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:32,520
 issues that I don't think any presidential administration would want to have to deal

950
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,520
 with.

951
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:45,040
 And I could add to that, from leaked sources, military and intel that I have encountered

952
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:54,720
 in my career, there is a complexity that as you go deeper beyond lights in the sky craft,

953
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,640
 a government interest in back engineering technology.

954
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:06,480
 There is testimony from, for example, someone who had worked at Wright-Patterson in the

955
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:17,640
 medical department who has told me, and this is a historic fact as far as I know, that

956
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:25,140
 one of the first autopsies that were done from one of the crashes in Roswell in 1947,

957
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,840
 and that was not the beginning.

958
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:34,600
 We had been retrieving craft and bodies from at least 1941 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

959
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:42,320
 But in terms of Roswell, one of the bodies, when the surgeon took a scalpel to start a

960
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:50,120
 T or a Y section on the autopsy, the report was this is not tissue.

961
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,120
 It was fabric.

962
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:57,360
 And that in 1947, our government was discovering that they weren't probably dealing with the

963
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,320
 prime intelligence that was behind the craft, that they were dealing with something that

964
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,160
 would fall into the area of androidism.

965
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:09,400
 Today we have drones that are overflying the world.

966
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:14,840
 Back in 1947, our government came to understand that some of the bodies that they were taking

967
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:21,120
 from these craft were not even biological tissue as we understand it.

968
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,420
 And then you combine that with a sentence that I read in the alleged briefing paper

969
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:30,860
 that I was shown at Curlin Air Force Base in the OSI office, the quote which has never

970
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:32,860
 left my mind.

971
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:38,180
 These extraterrestrial biological entities manipulated DNA and already evolving primates

972
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:41,560
 to create Homo sapien, close quote.

973
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:47,400
 Then that suggests that the relationship between what is in the skies, on the ground, underground

974
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:53,260
 and interacting with humans and animals and plant life on this planet, as one man working

975
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:59,060
 for the DIA in retirement told me, Linda, we are convinced that the intelligence interacting

976
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:06,520
 with this planet has been here for more than 270 million years predating the dinosaurs.

977
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:12,760
 If the size and the scope of this is that large, and if our government began to stumble

978
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:22,640
 on to these facts piece by piece in World War II and after, then I can understand why

979
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:29,920
 President Truman and Churchill and Eisenhower and that group of people would have said let's

980
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,920
 wait two generations until we find out what we're dealing with.

981
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:41,960
 And what makes me nervous and what bothers me is why in 2013 is the policy of denial

982
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:50,440
 not only in effect, but the people that I am talking to on the phone have visits by

983
01:20:50,440 --> 01:21:00,080
 somebody from the government saying you are not to talk to Linda Moulton Howe ever again.

984
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:07,240
 Something is very wrong in the underbelly of this country that I think is related directly

985
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:13,760
 to a policy of denial from World War II about the fact that extraterrestrial biological

986
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:20,560
 entities, to use our government's own phrase in its own alleged documents, are interacting

987
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,640
 with this planet have been for centuries and that there is an intimate relationship between

988
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:32,280
 what we are and what they made and that might explain why there is no wholesale evidence

989
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:37,280
 anywhere that the non-humans want to kill humans.

990
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,920
 They want, it appears from my point of view as an investigative reporter talking with so

991
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:49,840
 many people, that there is an ongoing research program about what is happening on this planet

992
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:56,040
 in the surface life on earth.

993
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:03,440
 We are now running about 10 minutes late.

994
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,440
 Pardon me.

995
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,000
 Yes, I understand that time is slipping away.

996
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,600
 Several of my questions have been asked.

997
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,640
 I hope that that is true for the next two witnesses so that their question period may

998
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,000
 be shorter.

999
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
 Congressman Cook.

1000
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,680
 I would like to claim my five minutes, Chairman, if that is all right.

1001
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:29,040
 I would like to ask Grant Cameron, maybe the first question, and if the others have a comment,

1002
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:37,160
 be very happy to take those two and Mr. Cameron, take a minute, but the others maybe ten seconds

1003
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:40,400
 if they have something to add.

1004
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:46,040
 I think you are the one that talked about five years of hearings for President Truman.

1005
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,840
 Briefings, yes.

1006
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,520
 And many, well, I know that Mr. Dolan also mentioned this.

1007
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,280
 I guess 16 different, did you say 16 different?

1008
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,000
 We figure between 16 and 20 briefings.

1009
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
 Okay.

1010
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:04,600
 Is it possible the Truman administration was concerned at the time more about either the

1011
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:11,120
 Soviet Union, which you did mention, I think, Mr. Dolan, or Nazi Germany as a source of

1012
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:17,800
 some of the unidentified flying maneuvers they were watching and reporting on and being

1013
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,840
 very concerned about?

1014
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,560
 I think it is basically the minute they looked at the Roswell crash, if that was the first

1015
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,720
 crash, they saw technology.

1016
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:27,720
 It's classified.

1017
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:28,720
 End of game.

1018
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,720
 This is, you're not giving this to the Soviets, you're not giving it to the Chinese.

1019
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,640
 This is our type of technology.

1020
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:40,640
 On Thursday, I'll refer to a Canadian government document, 1950, where the Canadians went to

1021
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,640
 the United States, talked to American officials, and one of the things that they were told

1022
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,960
 is that mental phenomena was involved with the saucers.

1023
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:52,760
 So there's a lot of technology here, and you just have to think, are you going to give

1024
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:57,680
 the technology that you may hear this week at this session, are you going to give it

1025
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,800
 to Al-Qaeda, are you going to give it to the Chinese?

1026
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:04,560
 To me, it was simple that Truman and the people around Truman saw technology.

1027
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,560
 We need this.

1028
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:10,320
 This is unbelievable technology, and whoever gets this technology rules the world.

1029
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,360
 We're not giving it away.

1030
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,360
 It's classified.

1031
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:16,240
 End of the story, and that's how it has started, and that's how it's been maintained.

1032
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:21,200
 Let me just add, sir, to answer your question relating to the Soviets and Nazis and so forth.

1033
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:26,920
 In the early era of this, these types of questions were being asked.

1034
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,840
 They absolutely were.

1035
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:34,520
 The question is, because you have different levels of security, and the declassified documents

1036
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:41,520
 that we have, really the top secret and above, we have very few of those.

1037
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:46,200
 So the declassified documents that are available to citizens are of the level of secret and

1038
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,640
 confidential and restricted.

1039
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:52,800
 Lower levels, they're still important, but they're not typically the very few that are

1040
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,320
 actually of top secret.

1041
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:01,560
 And I think that this is significant, because what has come to us are some lower-level classified

1042
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:06,840
 debates over the nature of these, and many of those did focus on, did the Soviets create

1043
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,440
 a flying saucer with their cache of German scientists?

1044
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,680
 Did we do this?

1045
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:16,680
 In those documents, I have seen no significant evidence to point to the Soviets or our own

1046
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,680
 German scientists.

1047
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,680
 Okay.

1048
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:25,120
 Before I invite maybe 15 seconds from both Mr. Friedman and Ms. Howe, could you also

1049
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:32,440
 comment on the testimony here that hasn't really said a whole lot.

1050
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:38,160
 It was mentioned briefly, but a whole lot about sightings before the 1940s, before the

1051
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,160
 Second World War.

1052
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,160
 I mean, did we...

1053
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:47,280
 I know you mentioned that there have been credible sightings for many, many years before,

1054
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:52,760
 but we really don't get a whole lot of interest on the part of an administration until the

1055
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,760
 '40s.

1056
01:25:53,760 --> 01:26:00,480
 Doesn't that add a little bit of question in terms of whether what we've just been talking

1057
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:06,820
 about might have been a real concern for the number of hearings being held?

1058
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:09,020
 I can add one thing.

1059
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:17,160
 What happened in July of 1945, we tested a bomb, white sands, and then we dropped two

1060
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,380
 in August on Japan.

1061
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:29,040
 And I believe that that action, which was a nuclear event, became a focus to this intelligence,

1062
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,480
 and therefore that's how the government became so intensely aware.

1063
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,200
 Can I add?

1064
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,200
 Sure.

1065
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,200
 I've done...

1066
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:42,200
 The presidents, I spent a lot of time trying to find stories of UFOs back in history through

1067
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,200
 presidents.

1068
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,180
 It starts in Roosevelt's day.

1069
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:46,520
 It ties into the atomic bomb.

1070
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:51,280
 If you go through presidential history, presidents are watched very closely, all their records

1071
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,280
 are kept.

1072
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,800
 I can find nothing before Roosevelt.

1073
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,560
 So this is tied into the atomic...

1074
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:02,840
 Okay, but you're not saying, Mr. Cameron, are any of you saying that President Wilson

1075
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:09,960
 would have never been interested in phenomena that might involve extraterrestrials?

1076
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:15,120
 I think the difference is that we really only in our own society develop much of a capability

1077
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,120
 of detecting them.

1078
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:20,000
 I mean, in World War II, we get radar, so we develop electronic means of detection.

1079
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,800
 We, for the first time ever, have a lot of people in the air.

1080
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,600
 So I think in earlier times, it's not that this phenomenon didn't happen, but there were

1081
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,880
 fewer stories and not really in front row center of our consciousness.

1082
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:38,040
 By the end of World War II, there were three things that told our visitors from out there

1083
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:42,640
 that soon we'd be going out there, which would scare the heck out of them because we're such

1084
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,160
 a primitive society.

1085
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:50,840
 Dark bombs, powerful rockets used to kill, not to deliver the mail, as some people said

1086
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:55,280
 they would, and powerful radar at the beginning of the electronics revolution.

1087
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:00,680
 The only place in the world in July 1947 where you could check out all three of those was

1088
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:05,480
 southeastern New Mexico, which is where Roswell is.

1089
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:10,560
 I'm going to reclaim just the last 30 seconds if I can, too, and again, if you'll take just

1090
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,800
 maybe a quick yes or no.

1091
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:23,840
 In your views, is it possible that if there indeed is such thing as extraterrestrial,

1092
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:31,120
 unidentified flying objects, that they would be more likely to be artificial intelligence

1093
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:37,520
 instead of normal intelligence, given timescales of travel near a star, what, two to three

1094
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,640
 light years away, for example?

1095
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:45,600
 I think artificial intelligence is an extremely valid hypothesis I've entertained for many

1096
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,600
 years.

1097
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,160
 I think they would be the product of an advanced ... I mean, we're less than a generation away

1098
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:55,000
 from having our computers talking to us and claiming possibly to be sentient themselves.

1099
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,560
 This is what AI theorists, and they're all mainstream people, is a very common belief,

1100
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:04,320
 so I have to assume that some other civilization will have gotten to that point.

1101
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:12,240
 A confirmed physicist working on ring lasers at Wright-Patterson told me in the 1990s that

1102
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:19,760
 he had firsthand knowledge about the extraterrestrial story, and that he, as a physicist in the

1103
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:25,720
 work that he was doing, that they knew, meaning the people that are involved with studying

1104
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:31,640
 the phenomena in the government, that we are dealing with technology so advanced that they

1105
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:37,880
 literally can bend space-time and move point to point through the universe.

1106
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:44,160
 That physicist from Wright-Patterson, at a table, used what is now a metaphor generally

1107
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,360
 in this whole subject.

1108
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:51,440
 He took the napkin on the lunch table, and he put it and said, "Linda, this is what they

1109
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,440
 do."

1110
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,200
 He put one point, and he did like this.

1111
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,880
 This is space-time.

1112
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:03,720
 We're dealing with technologies that can bend space-time and put the corner to the corner.

1113
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:11,600
 That is why Euclidean geometry and time, as we know it on this planet, have no relevance

1114
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:18,320
 to the phenomena and the intelligence that we're dealing with.

1115
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:23,600
 Thank you.

1116
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,960
 Time does have some relevance for us, and we are running late.

1117
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,720
 There are two left.

1118
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,720
 I'm sorry.

1119
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,720
 That'll be a stretch.

1120
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:35,160
 Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1121
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:39,560
 Thanks for all of you for testifying.

1122
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,960
 Question.

1123
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:49,320
 Has there been a decrease in the number of incidents that have happened, at least in

1124
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:53,840
 this country, or because it seemed like this was talked about a lot, and there were a lot

1125
01:30:53,840 --> 01:31:03,000
 of sightings at some time, whether it was over the Prairie State, but that seems ... You

1126
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,040
 don't read about it very much today.

1127
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,000
 That's the kicker.

1128
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
 It's not a question of how much is going on.

1129
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,640
 It's how much do we hear about it.

1130
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,200
 I check most of my audiences at the end of my lecture.

1131
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,440
 I don't have guts enough to do it at the beginning, and find that 10 percent of the attendees

1132
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:22,320
 believe they've seen a flying saucer, but then I ask, how many of you reported what

1133
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,320
 you saw?

1134
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,400
 Ninety percent of the hands go down.

1135
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:31,380
 MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network, is getting over 600 reports a month.

1136
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:36,920
 You don't hear about most of those cases, where the public's grown accustomed, I guess,

1137
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,520
 or the media's unwilling to get involved.

1138
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,440
 How many UFO reporters do you know?

1139
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:46,520
 I know of two competent journalists who are really into UFOs.

1140
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:50,080
 That's an awful small number, George Knapp being one.

1141
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,000
 What about in other countries?

1142
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,680
 Are they reported, or is that-

1143
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,320
 I find sightings everywhere.

1144
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:02,480
 The sightings are very common, but what isn't uniform are proper distribution networks or

1145
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,960
 reporting systems that are in place.

1146
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:10,240
 What we've developed here in the US are a number of websites that collect reports.

1147
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:15,700
 As I mentioned earlier, my estimate is a rough one, but it's not less than 10,000 reports

1148
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:23,060
 actually are written by people per year, 10,000 in North America, the US and Canada.

1149
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:25,080
 Elsewhere in the world, there are obviously many sightings.

1150
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:29,360
 They're increasing, they're not decreasing, because people are now having better capabilities

1151
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,360
 of reporting these.

1152
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:36,080
 One of the problems with under less developed nations elsewhere in the world in years past

1153
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,840
 is just if you saw a UFO, who do you report it to?

1154
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,800
 There was really no mechanisms to do it.

1155
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,680
 That's improving now, so now we're seeing reports out of China, India, Africa, and really

1156
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:52,240
 around the world, but still there aren't- there's not a lot of infrastructure among

1157
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:56,320
 civilian groups, for example, who really would be the ones that publicize this to get the

1158
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,320
 word out.

1159
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,240
 You have your YouTube channels and people doing this on their own.

1160
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:04,360
 What really I think is needed is a kind of coordinated global kind of organizational

1161
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,760
 effort, and hopefully we'll get that.

1162
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,920
 Another problem is language.

1163
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:14,640
 I am constantly confronted with the issue that something happens in China or South America

1164
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:18,600
 or a country that does not speak English.

1165
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:24,520
 I'm an American journalist trying to report so that an American audience can understand.

1166
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:30,320
 I have worked sometimes for an entire week just trying to find a reporter in China or

1167
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:36,240
 someplace who could help me do a translation so that it could get closer to first-hand

1168
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,240
 facts.

1169
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,800
 It is so difficult.

1170
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:45,320
 We're on a planet and where communication is basically blocked, whether it is country

1171
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:50,640
 to country or even neighborhood to neighborhood in China, because the syntactical differences

1172
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:56,160
 in the language there are so overwhelming that a man I know who lives there, works there

1173
01:33:56,160 --> 01:34:02,520
 from England, who tries to help, you still have translation problems there within very

1174
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,200
 short distances.

1175
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,600
 And so you take that to this complex phenomena.

1176
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:15,800
 I know for a fact every month across my desk and in my computer world, hundreds and hundreds

1177
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,120
 and hundreds of reports coming from around the world.

1178
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:25,560
 How do we follow up unless we have translators and an open government policy around the world

1179
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:30,600
 where people feel that they can report honestly what they've encountered without some sort

1180
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:36,120
 of retribution by the government, which is distinctly the way it is working in the United

1181
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:41,220
 States, or criticism from fellow human beings?

1182
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:47,440
 Humans are more afraid of ridicule and criticism from humans than they are of nonhumans.

1183
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:56,320
 Can I just make a point that I made in my presentation, which sort of sums this up.

1184
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,560
 The problem is the coverage.

1185
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,280
 It's not how many sightings there are.

1186
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,400
 The more people are covering it, the more sightings you're going to get.

1187
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,200
 Basically it comes down to the story of Chase Brandon.

1188
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:09,640
 Chase Brandon was identifying himself as the second most powerful person in the CIA outside

1189
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:13,120
 the director to speak publicly on behalf of the CIA.

1190
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:17,380
 He was the liaison for CIA to Hollywood.

1191
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:19,640
 He could speak publicly on behalf of the CIA.

1192
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:23,960
 He comes out in front of two million people and says, "I saw the files.

1193
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,480
 I saw a box.

1194
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,680
 Roswell was real.

1195
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:28,120
 There was aliens.

1196
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,340
 This is for real."

1197
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:32,080
 And nobody covered the story.

1198
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,440
 It's as simple as that.

1199
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:36,360
 It's just not being covered.

1200
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:41,600
 Thank you.

1201
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,600
 Thank you very much.

1202
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,840
 As I had anticipated, most of my questions have been asked.

1203
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:49,640
 There was lots of discussion on why a cover-up.

1204
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,640
 Congressman Cook asked a question.

1205
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:55,240
 There wasn't a lengthy discussion of it, and that is there have been a number of sightings

1206
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:59,360
 before anybody had an airplane or a lighter than aircraft in the air, and I think that

1207
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,760
 people need to understand that this is not just a current day.

1208
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,640
 As our technology has developed, the sightings have become more frequent, but there have

1209
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,120
 been sightings way back in history.

1210
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,120
 Am I not correct?

1211
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,120
 Correct.

1212
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,120
 That is absolutely correct.

1213
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,120
 Okay.

1214
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,600
 I just wanted that to be on the record.

1215
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:18,360
 By the way, extraterrestrials are not anti-biblical.

1216
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:22,120
 If you read the book of Job, you should expect them.

1217
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:26,160
 Maybe they can't get here, but they sure got to heaven as far as the book of Job is concerned.

1218
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,820
 You can read about them there.

1219
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:31,080
 The one question I had which wasn't answered, and I would like you don't have to give an

1220
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:37,080
 answer now because time is up, but I would like for the record for you to tell us how

1221
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,560
 many unexplained sightings out there.

1222
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:46,360
 Now, lots of these things can be kind of wished away and explained away to people that get

1223
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,360
 on a craft.

1224
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:51,040
 They could have rehearsed their lies so that they now, under hypnotism, tell you the same

1225
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,040
 lie.

1226
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,920
 But there are some things that just can't be explained away.

1227
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:59,600
 How many sightings have there been, unexplained sightings, that have been accompanied by radar?

1228
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:05,200
 Sightings are easy, lights and clouds and so forth, and that can behave in very erratic

1229
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,200
 ways.

1230
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,320
 But, you know, how many of these sightings have been accompanied by radar tracks?

1231
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,800
 If you could provide that from the record, it's not just a few, I understand.

1232
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,800
 It's a great many of those.

1233
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:19,640
 But I think the public would be very interested in how many unexplained sightings out there

1234
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:24,400
 have been accompanied by radar where these objects were doing things that no known Earth

1235
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,700
 craft can do.

1236
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:28,240
 You can provide that for the record?

1237
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:30,160
 We can try.

1238
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:36,000
 We don't know, and we also know that such reports are carefully covered up to use the

1239
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
 expression.

1240
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,920
 But I've seen some reference to those things.

1241
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,080
 Do the best you can, because I think the public would like to know.

1242
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:46,960
 Of publicly known, there have to be more than 100, probably several hundred, if we were

1243
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,520
 to tally them together.

1244
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:53,400
 And there presumably are many that just are classified.

1245
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:57,080
 But there are quite a few that we do know about that have been declassified or that

1246
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,560
 came out one way or another.

1247
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,560
 There's quite a few.

1248
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,560
 I don't know about thousands.

1249
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:06,700
 If you could give some indication, it's not just one or two, some indication so that the

1250
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,640
 public can know how many of those.

1251
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,720
 This has been a very interesting hearing.

1252
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:11,720
 Thank you very much.

1253
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:14,040
 The hearing will now stand in brief recess.

1254
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:14,760
 Thank you very much.
