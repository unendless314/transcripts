1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,180
 I would like to call the afternoon session of our hearing assistance hearing on disclosure

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,180
 to order.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:21,420
 Gentlemen, if you would rise and repeat after me, I'd appreciate it.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:29,100
 I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,480
 And nothing but the truth.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,600
 To this committee today.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,260
 To this committee today.

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,900
 Thank you very much.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,520
 We'll begin with Captain Roger Salas.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,120
 Am I pronouncing that right, sir?

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
 Salas is correct.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
 Thank you.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
 Thank you, sir.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,600
 Mr. Kilpatrick and panel, I would first like to briefly describe the incident that I experienced

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,560
 in March 1967.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,080
 At that time, I was a First Lieutenant, U.S. Air Force Station at Maldenstrom Air Force

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,860
 Base, Montana.

18
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,040
 I was trained in assigned duties as a missile launch officer for the Minuteman I intercontinental

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,140
 ballistic missile.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,720
 I was designated Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander and part of a two-man crew.

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,260
 My commander at that time was Lieutenant Frederick Mywold.

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,300
 He's now deceased.

23
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,540
 I will briefly review the -- well, the diagrams showing the launch control center, the launch

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,340
 facility we will show you shortly when one of the other speakers present.

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,820
 We were on duty inside the Oscar Launch Control Center, a concrete capsule located about 60

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,900
 feet underground.

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,800
 We had operational control over 10 Minuteman nuclear missiles.

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,640
 Each missile operates independently and has its own source of primary and backup power

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,940
 systems.

30
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,900
 It is important for you to note that the command and control for these missiles was entirely

31
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,920
 located within the capsule.

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,300
 There was absolutely no means to affect any of the missile systems from outside the capsule.

33
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:11,060
 On the evening of March 24, 1967, while my commander was on a scheduled rest break, I

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:19,020
 received the first of two phone calls from my topside flight security controller, FSC.

35
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,060
 The first call was to report unidentified lighted objects flying above the facility.

36
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,780
 They reported they were flying at very high speeds, making very odd maneuvers, nothing

37
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,360
 that an aircraft could do, and they just wanted to report it.

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:46,140
 I didn't pay much attention to that first call, and I basically hung up on them.

39
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,380
 Just later, the FSC phoned again and reported in a very agitated state that there was a

40
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,060
 large oval-shaped object hovering above the front gate.

41
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:04,100
 It was a red pulsating lighted object, approximately 30, 40 feet in diameter, the best he could

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,540
 describe it.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,940
 It was difficult to distinguish a structural part of it on the inside, except that it was

44
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,900
 a glowing red pulsating object.

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,700
 He had all the men out there with their weapons drawn, and he wanted me to tell him what to

46
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,340
 do next.

47
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,580
 I, of course, told him something like, "Make sure nothing comes inside the perimeter fence."

48
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:39,060
 Of course, our primary duty was to secure those nuclear missiles.

49
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,260
 Immediately after that call, I started to inform my commander about the incident.

50
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,780
 As I started to inform my commander, our missiles began to shut down.

51
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,140
 We lost alert status on all 10 missiles while this object was above our facility.

52
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,820
 When we queried the fault system, all missiles reported guidance and control system failure.

53
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,140
 We had a way of querying faults within the system called VERSA.

54
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,740
 It's a voice activated system, and we were getting channels 9 and 12, which is guidance

55
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,660
 and control system.

56
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,300
 At the same time, we had indicator lights showing security violations at two of the

57
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,700
 launch facilities where the missiles were physically located.

58
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,940
 While Lieutenant Mywald reported the incident to the Wing Command post, I phoned upstairs

59
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,060
 and directed the security alert team to be sent to those launch facilities with security

60
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,620
 violations to investigate those indications.

61
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,380
 At that time, the FSC reported to me that the object had flown off at high speed.

62
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:50,060
 When the security alert team arrived at the affected LFs, LFs meaning launch facilities,

63
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,500
 they reported seeing the object hovering over those sites.

64
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,280
 As they approached closer to the object, they lost all communications with the FSC.

65
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,740
 After speaking to the Wing Command post, Lieutenant Mywald informed me that the same

66
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,280
 thing happened at another flight.

67
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,740
 At that time, I assumed that meant that night, but it turns out what he meant was it happened

68
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,540
 at another flight about a week earlier, and that's the Echo flight incident, which I'll

69
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,540
 talk about shortly.

70
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:28,620
 Right now, I'd like you to hear the portion of the conversation I had with Colonel Mywald,

71
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,220
 who retired as a full colonel.

72
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,780
 I had this conversation sometime in 1996.

73
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,780
 Can we play the first audio, please?

74
00:05:40,780 --> 00:06:01,900
 Because they were doing maintenance on, I don't know, the guidance cans or something,

75
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:11,900
 and I had a conversation with Colonel Mywald and he said, "You know what, I'm going to

76
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
 tell you something.

77
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,900
 This is the first time that I've ever heard of this, and I've never heard of it before.

78
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,900
 I've never heard of it before.

79
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,900
 I've never heard of it before."

80
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

81
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

82
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

83
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

84
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

85
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

86
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

87
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

88
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

89
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

90
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

91
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

92
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

93
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

94
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

95
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

96
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

97
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

98
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
 He said, "I've never heard of it before."

99
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

100
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

101
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

102
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

103
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

104
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

105
00:06:45,900 --> 00:07:06,660
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

106
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:25,660
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

107
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:42,500
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

108
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:59,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

109
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

110
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

111
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

112
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

113
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

114
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

115
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

116
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

117
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

118
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

119
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

120
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

121
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

122
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

123
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

124
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

125
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

126
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

127
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

128
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

129
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

130
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

131
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

132
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

133
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

134
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

135
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,940
 I said, "I've never heard of it before."

136
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:42,940
 And he described the fact that on two of his launch facilities, he had maintenance crews out there and security guards.

137
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:53,940
 And when the first missile went down in his flight, they reported that there were UFOs overhead as the missiles went down.

138
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,940
 He lost all 10 of his missiles in rapid succession.

139
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,940
 That incident occurred on March 16th, 1967.

140
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,940
 He launched them and they went down?

141
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,940
 No, no, the missiles were not launched.

142
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:20,940
 They reported that the objects were above them, and at that point the missiles started shutting down, disabled.

143
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:34,940
 The second audio recording you heard was that of Colonel Mywald talking about the fact that we had security light violations and we had to send guards out to one or more of the LFs.

144
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,940
 And they reported seeing the UFOs again.

145
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:47,940
 By the way, I've got more audio available that's where Colonel Mywald supports my entire statement about what occurred.

146
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:57,940
 So he was consistent on supporting this up until the time he passed away last year.

147
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,940
 After we were relieved by another crew the next morning, right back to the base, we reported to the squadron commander's office.

148
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,940
 There we were ordered to sign non-disclosure statements regarding our specific incident.

149
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,940
 I did sign a non-disclosure statement.

150
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,940
 And we were ordered not to talk to anybody about this.

151
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,940
 It was then designated a highly classified incident.

152
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,940
 At no time did we lose power during the incident, I want to emphasize.

153
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,940
 We always had electrical power.

154
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:42,940
 The sensitive information network, SIN cables that carried the signals to the missile systems were triply shielded from electromagnetic interference.

155
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,940
 The preliminary investigation isolated the failure to the logic coupler at each missile.

156
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,940
 The logic coupler is associated with the missile guidance system.

157
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,940
 That's about the best I can explain to you what the logic coupler does.

158
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,940
 I'll refer you to a portion of the unit wing history.

159
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:14,940
 I believe you have documents that I supplied you with that talk about the echo flight incident.

160
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,940
 I'll just read part of it.

161
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:27,940
 It says in the opinion of the team was that externally generated signals caused the generation of these two channels and shut down the launch facilities.

162
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:38,940
 The possibility of this is very remote due to the fact that all ten couplers would have to fail in the flight within a few seconds of each other.

163
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:45,940
 This statement confirms that signals were sent to each individual missile separately in order to disable them.

164
00:11:45,940 --> 00:12:00,940
 From my knowledge of the operating system at the time, neither I nor the investigative team could define the method or means by which these signals were sent to disable the missiles each in the same manner,

165
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:07,940
 meaning each missile failed for the same reason, guidance and control system failure.

166
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:15,940
 Mr. Robert Kaminsky was the Boeing team leader for the investigation of the echo flight shutdown.

167
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:23,940
 In a response to our inquiry, he stated this kind of event is virtually impossible once the system was up and running.

168
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:33,940
 The team met with me to report their findings and it was decided that the final report would have nothing significant in it to explain what happened at echo flight.

169
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:42,940
 Just one moment, Captain. We did not explain it. Just working with my congressional research assistant on the end of the table, we are going to allow ten minutes for each of you.

170
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,940
 I'm not sure. I just got the time sign for the captain and I don't believe that he's been talking ten minutes, has he?

171
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,940
 He has.

172
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,940
 He has been talking ten minutes. Captain, can you -- and since we didn't let you know ahead of time, I'm going to give you additional three minutes if that's okay.

173
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,940
 Thank you very much. I'll try to get through it as quickly as I can.

174
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,940
 That's okay.

175
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:10,940
 After meeting with the engineers to discuss the results of their investigation, Mr. Kaminsky was notified by his supervisor that he should not submit his final report because the incident was reported to be a UFO event.

176
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:19,940
 Even though the Boeing company was the principal contractor for the M91 missile, the report on the incident was not submitted by specific request of the Air Force.

177
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:28,940
 However, the Air Force did perform their own classified investigation where they identified a possible failure mode as stated above.

178
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:41,940
 In my opinion, we did not have the technical capability to produce a machine then or now that would be able to instigate the failure mode of these missiles identified in the unit wing history.

179
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:49,940
 In addition, the unidentified objects displayed the physical and flight characteristics that no known aircraft type could achieve then or now.

180
00:13:49,940 --> 00:14:07,940
 Therefore, I have concluded these objects were non-terrestrial in origin. An important related activity ongoing, and this is important, on December 17, 1969, the official U.S. Air Force investigation to the UFO phenomenon was terminated.

181
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:17,940
 The principal basis for this, and you have the Air Force position on UFOs, I believe, I've given you a copy of that.

182
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:29,940
 The principal basis for this termination was the evaluation of a report prepared by the University of Colorado entitled "Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects."

183
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:37,940
 In 1966, the U.S. Air Force awarded a half million dollar contract to the University of Colorado for the purpose of studying the UFO phenomenon.

184
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:51,940
 I'll refer to this study as the Condon investigation for its team leader, Edward Condon. In fact, it was never intended to be a scientific study because the Air Force did not propose that any scientific hypothesis regarding the phenomenon be evaluated.

185
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:58,940
 The Condon team relied on input and evaluations of report UFO incidents from Air Force officers at various bases.

186
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:06,940
 The Condon team was, except for one individual, not authorized to review classified reports of Air Force incidents regarding the phenomenon.

187
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:15,940
 They were not even informed that classified UFO files existed until after the termination of their study. I have evidence supporting this.

188
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:23,940
 With respect to the 1967 Echo and Oscar flight UFO incidents, there was a deliberate effort to keep information about those incidents from the Condon committee.

189
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:39,940
 In 1967, Dr. Roy Craig, the chief investigator for the Condon committee, was informed by Mr. Raymond Fowler, a contractor working for Sylvania on Minuteman Electrical Systems, that the Echo flight shutdowns at Malmstrom had occurred during UFO sighting.

190
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:50,940
 In October '67, he visited Malmstrom to inquire about this. Dr. Craig recalls this inquiry with Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Chase, the base operations officer at Malmstrom.

191
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,940
 After Colonel Chase hinted, I had exchanged pleasantries in his office. This is a quotation.

192
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,940
 I asked him about the Echo incident. The Colonel caught his breath and expressed surprise that I knew of it.

193
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:08,940
 I can't talk about that, he said. Colonel Chase had assured me that the incident had not involved the UFO.

194
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:17,940
 Since Colonel Chase was the last man I would doubt, when he conveyed this information, I accepted the information as factual and turned the review over to Bob Lowe,

195
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:27,940
 who had received -- Robert Lowe was the deputy accountant, and he was the only one cleared to look at classified information.

196
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:39,940
 When Dr. Robert Lowe, the deputy accountant, requested the Air Force allow him to review the secret report of the Echo incident, he was informed that the report would be too highly classified to allow that review.

197
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:50,940
 Dr. Craig did not review any -- did not interview any of the many witnesses that were named to him by Ray Fowler that he could have interviewed.

198
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,940
 He did not interview either of the crews, Echo or Oscar crew.

199
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:07,940
 In addition, the Air Force officer, Project Blue Book, was deliberately misinformed about these incidents in a letter from Colonel James Menott, and I think you have these letters in front of you.

200
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,940
 He was a right-pat, Blue Book, essentially.

201
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:24,940
 A request of Colonel Chase in June of '67 inquired of reports they had received that there were equipment malfunctions and abnormalities during the UFO sightings.

202
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:33,940
 The written reply from Colonel Chase stated, "This office has no knowledge of equipment malfunctions and abnormalities in equipment during the period of UFO sightings."

203
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:40,940
 This evidence and the Air Force -- Captain, I think you just have a short piece to go, is that right? Just one page left?

204
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,940
 Just very short. Yes, sir. Please proceed.

205
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,940
 I'm almost done. Please proceed.

206
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,940
 And by the way, this is a very complex case. Absolutely. We can tell. Yes, sir. Thank you, and we appreciate your testimony.

207
00:17:51,940 --> 00:18:00,940
 This is evidence that the Air Force purposefully denied the con investigators the knowledge that the Echo and Oscar flight shutdowns were UFO-related incidents.

208
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:07,940
 Since the Air Force cites this particular study as the primary reason for the official rejection of the UFO phenomenon

209
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,940
 and claims that no UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force was ever an indication of threat to our national security.

210
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:26,940
 And in light of my own experience and others, I must conclude the U.S. Air Force was and is engaged in lying and disinforming the public about the realities of the UFO phenomenon.

211
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:33,940
 That's the end of my statement. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

212
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:44,940
 Very, very briefly, I just want to point out the fact that the next two witnesses that you will hear from, Mr. Scindelli and Mr. Scott,

213
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:51,940
 this is the very first time they are going public, and I want to honor these guys for having the courage to do so. Thank you.

214
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:59,940
 Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kathy. Mr. Scindelli.

215
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:06,940
 My name is David D. Scindelli, Captain, U.S. Air Force, retired.

216
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:15,940
 In 1966, I was involved in an incident while stationed at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota.

217
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:25,940
 I was told to never speak of the incident again and also told that as far as I was concerned, it never happened.

218
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,940
 Because of that, I am before you today with a bit of trepidation.

219
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:42,940
 I must say a lot of trepidation, as I have never before shown my face in person on this matter.

220
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:51,940
 I was a Minuteman ICBM launch control officer, a first lieutenant, and a deputy missile combat crew commander

221
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,940
 in a two-man launch control, launch crew with my crew commander who held the rank of captain.

222
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:09,940
 He was about 15 years older than I. I held a top secret clearance, which was required for my job.

223
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,940
 It all began one morning when I was watching TV while having breakfast,

224
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,940
 and I heard the local news announcer mention that some residents in the town of Mole Hall, North Dakota

225
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,940
 had seen strange lights overnight, which they attributed to a UFO.

226
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:34,940
 This caught my attention because I was scheduled for duty that morning at a launch control facility called November Flight,

227
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:42,940
 about three miles west of Mole Hall, and about 37 miles north of Minut, North Dakota.

228
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:49,940
 I lived in the town of Minut at the time, and I drove to the air base to attend the morning pre-departure crew briefing

229
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:56,940
 at Wigan headquarters, where all 15 missile crews would normally meet each day prior to pulling alert duty

230
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,940
 at the respective launch control facilities.

231
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:08,940
 During that pre-departure crew briefing, it was mentioned that some missiles at November Flight had gone off alert,

232
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,940
 but there was no further information provided.

233
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,940
 I immediately connected this to the news item that I heard earlier in the morning

234
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,940
 regarding a possible UFO sighting near the town of Mole Hall.

235
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:30,940
 When the briefing was over, several of the launch crews seated near me commented about the news item,

236
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,940
 which they had also heard that morning, and there was speculation about a possible connection with November Flight.

237
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:46,940
 My crew commander had also heard the news item, and we were both anxious and quite curious about what we might find

238
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,940
 as we drove out to the launch control facility.

239
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:59,940
 If you could display my second slide.

240
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:07,940
 On this second slide, I don't believe you members have a picture of this, but you can see it on the screen here.

241
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:18,940
 This is the November launch control facility from an air view from Google Earth.

242
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:25,940
 There is an access road to the facility from the north coming down to the flight facility,

243
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,940
 where there's a main gate at the perimeter fence.

244
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:43,940
 The perimeter fence goes around the launch control facility building topside, and there's a garage to the right of the main gate.

245
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,940
 The usual procedure upon arrival was to inspect the grounds and building,

246
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:56,940
 but this time my commander immediately went into the security section of the building to debrief security personnel and guards.

247
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:05,940
 The security center was the topmost north side of the building near the main gate.

248
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,940
 I entered the facility from the back door at the end of the facility and then encountered the site manager,

249
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:18,940
 a tech sergeant, who immediately took me into the day room and asked if I had been briefed on the previous night's events.

250
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,940
 I said I hadn't.

251
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,940
 We then proceeded toward the windows on the west side of the day room, where he described to me the large object

252
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:35,940
 with flashing lights that had been hovering just outside the fence that night,

253
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:42,940
 and he spread his arms out in front of him to indicate its size, the size of the object.

254
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:54,940
 Based on his description, I estimated the object may have been 80 to 100 feet wide and approximately 100 feet from the building, maybe a bit closer.

255
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:01,940
 I immediately asked if it had been a helicopter, and he said that it just hovered with no noise being heard,

256
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,940
 quite unlike the usual noisy helicopters heard from within the building.

257
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,940
 I also asked what the flashing lights were like, but he could not answer.

258
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,940
 They were unlike any he had ever seen.

259
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:21,940
 They were not like the usual beacon lights on planes, but something like a pulsating glow.

260
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:31,940
 He then said the object, while hovering close to the ground, then glided to the right toward the north end of the building and out of sight.

261
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:39,940
 The object then came into view from the security section of the facility and hovered just behind and slightly to the right of the main gate.

262
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,940
 Concealed partly by the large garage located within the fenced area to the right of the gate.

263
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:54,940
 As you can see there, the garage is labeled, the second position of the object.

264
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:03,940
 This location put the object almost directly above the hardened launch control capsule, located 60 feet below ground.

265
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:12,940
 All our missiles, our 10 missiles, were located 4 to 14 miles away from the launch control facility.

266
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,940
 This capsule was located approximately underneath the garage.

267
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:27,940
 This was the launch crew quarters and the launch control center for all 10 interconnected nuclear-tipped missiles that were located away from the launch facility.

268
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,940
 Security personnel confirmed everything that the site manager had related to me.

269
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:42,940
 My commander and I then proceeded to take the elevator down to the launch control center, the capsule, to relieve the two-man officer crew below.

270
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:54,940
 After entering the capsule, our eyes were immediately transfixed on the launch control console, which showed that all missiles were off alert and unlaunchable.

271
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,940
 We had never seen such a thing before.

272
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:12,940
 The outgoing crew briefed us on the wild events that transpired overnight and indicated that the missiles malfunctioned at the time the object was hovering directly above the capsule and next to the main gate.

273
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,940
 We speculated on the possibility of an EMF pulse that might have created the situation.

274
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:32,940
 We had no doubt, however, that the 10 outlying nuclear-tipped missiles of November flight had been compromised, tampered with, and put out of commission by the object that had paid a visit.

275
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:48,940
 Normally, it was quite unusual to have even one missile down, except for maintenance, and Wing headquarters was very proud of having more than 95 percent uptime for all 150 missiles of the Wing.

276
00:26:48,940 --> 00:27:03,940
 The following morning, after we had been relieved by the follow-on crew, we arrived Hopside, and I attempted to further query the flight security controller who had been on duty at the time of the situation.

277
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:10,940
 But he interrupted me, and he said that he had been instructed not to discuss the incident.

278
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:23,940
 That is when my commander then told me that he had received a call while I was on a scheduled respite break down below, and he told me -- and he was told that we were never to discuss the incident.

279
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,940
 When I asked where the directive came from, he said the OSI.

280
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,940
 He evidently received a call from the OSI.

281
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:49,940
 With no discussion allowed on the subject, between him and me together, or with anybody else, my crew commander and I were left in limbo and left on our own to conjure in our own minds how other situations might unfold and be handled.

282
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,940
 Normally, the Air Force would train us on all procedures.

283
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,940
 We were in a simulator constantly training.

284
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:05,940
 This serious lack of follow-through by the Air Force was more than bewildering, and it served to keep this situation on our minds.

285
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,940
 Together, there were a dozen of us involved with this incident.

286
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:27,940
 My commander and I were not there during the encounter, but we had to deal with the ramifications of the incident, and I'll never forget the frightened emotion on the faces of topside airmen who were gathered with me when I was briefed by the site manager.

287
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:52,940
 Besides those of us at the launch control facility, there had to be many more people involved with this, including maintenance people who had to retarget and reline the missiles, also additional security personnel to guard and protect the missile launch facilities, and who knows how many others on base were concerned.

288
00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:03,940
 Everyone had been silenced. The incident was never discussed, and I never heard a word of any other incident from people that I associated with.

289
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:14,940
 I never spoke a word about my incident for almost 40 years, and my wife never knew.

290
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:39,940
 After several years of searching the Internet in the hopes of finding someone who would give me a clue about my incident, I then found what was described by Captain Robert Salas, and I felt immediate joyous freedom from my haunting memory.

291
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,940
 I then informed my wife.

292
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:53,940
 Since then, I have run across several missileers from my days at Minot who were there with me in the wing, and two of them have gone public with their own experiences.

293
00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:00,940
 Two others have described to me their unique experiences, but they have pleaded that I not divulge their names.

294
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:10,940
 They fear losing their first pension, are losing their personal integrity and keeping it secret, or have been ridiculed.

295
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:21,940
 I also know of two other officers involved in incidents, but they will not admit to their secret, probably for the same reasons.

296
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:30,940
 And then there's the late Captain Val Smith of my squadron, who is mentioned in official documents released by FIA.

297
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:50,940
 He was interviewed by the late Dr. Alan Heineck of Blue Book fame, who wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post, published on 17 December 1966, which described the incident that Smith was involved with on 25 August 1966.

298
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:58,940
 Heineck stated in the article, "This incident was not picked up by the press.

299
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:09,940
 It is typical of the puzzling cases that I have studied during the 18 years that I have served as the Air Force's scientific consultant on the problem of UFOs."

300
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,940
 Display the third slide, please.

301
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:32,940
 Just prior to release of this post article, the Minot Daily News got wind of it, and then published on 6 December 1966, a front page news item with major bold headline that read, "Minot Launch Control Center Saucer, Cited as One Indication of Outer Space Visitors."

302
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:42,940
 The front page. I remember this article. I thought, "Oh, maybe I could start talking."

303
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:50,940
 In 1966, when I was at Minot, the evidence was everywhere that something quite unique was happening.

304
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,940
 But I was embedded in a shell of silence.

305
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:08,940
 The Air Force knew the truth. The Air Force knew that I knew the truth, and that is the only reason they warned and instructed me that it never happened.

306
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:23,940
 Thank you.

307
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,940
 And thank you, sir, for your courage today and for your service.

308
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,940
 Sergeant Scott.

309
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,940
 I'm Tech Sergeant David Charles Scott, United States Air Force Security Police, retired.

310
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:52,940
 At the time of my sighting, I was an Airman First Class with a secret security clearance and was assigned to Alpha Flight 91st Missile Security Squadron, Strategic Air Command, Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota.

311
00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:11,940
 November, 1974. It was after midnight when Airman Bill Gray, a member of my security alert team, and I were dispatched from Alpha 1 Launch Control Facility to an alarm situation at one of our 10-minute manned nuclear missile sites.

312
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,940
 Probably just another jackrabbit setting off an outer zone alarm, we thought.

313
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,940
 As we drove there, Gray spotted a strange light in the night sky, called it to my attention.

314
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,940
 It appeared to be about the size of a star in the sky, but was pulsating red.

315
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:39,940
 We checked the site and found everything secure. Gray said the strange light had gotten bigger and acted weird when I was below.

316
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:48,940
 Then we parked our vehicle off-site to await the alarm system to reset and the order which would allow us to leave the area.

317
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:57,940
 Now the strange light in the sky was pulsating and changing color in a sequence red, blue, and yellow.

318
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:04,940
 Suddenly our radio went dead and the idling engine of our vehicle quit.

319
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:10,940
 Gray and I sat there on guard duty for 45 minutes, protecting our missile site.

320
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:16,940
 We wondered aloud if the strange light above was a UFO.

321
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:28,940
 When the light changed to white and pulsated three times and in quick succession, it disappeared and our engine came to life as the radio also came back on.

322
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:36,940
 As it did, Sergeant Hicks, our flight security controller, called and ordered us back to Alpha 1.

323
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,940
 All alarms had reset properly back at the missile site.

324
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,940
 We arrived back at Alpha 1 a little after three in the morning.

325
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,940
 We reported our story to Sergeant Hicks about the strange light.

326
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,940
 We wanted to convince him that we had not fallen asleep on duty or we weren't drunk.

327
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,940
 He said, "I believe you, men."

328
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,940
 Then Sergeant Hicks hit us with a bombshell.

329
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:11,940
 All Minuteman nuclear missile site alarms in our wing had sounded simultaneously.

330
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:23,940
 Many security police and security alert teams reported seeing the strange lights, which Gray and I saw, and they too lost radio communication and vehicle power.

331
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,940
 "You know what I think?" Gray asked. "I think it was a UFO."

332
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940
 Sergeant Hicks just nodded.

333
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:36,940
 I ventured. "Should we report it? Gray and I aren't lying. We'll write statements."

334
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,940
 Gray signaled his agreement with a nod.

335
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,940
 Sergeant Hicks said, "Why stir up a lot of trouble?

336
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,940
 The official Air Force position is that UFOs don't even exist.

337
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:54,940
 Let's just drop it unless you two want to get laughed out of this service."

338
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:06,940
 A few nights later, in the security police barracks back at Minot Air Force Base, I was listening to a news broadcast from Winnipeg, Canada, radio station.

339
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:18,940
 The announcer read the story of an incident which had occurred just a few nights before, and fighter planes of the Canadian Air Force had scrambled to pursue the UFO.

340
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:26,940
 The fighters tracked it until it climbed at a steep angle and, with blazing speed, disappeared.

341
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,940
 The Canadians responded to the UFO that was over our missile site.

342
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:54,940
 When that UFO, when that strange light disappeared, the Canadians picked up on it because the reporter on the radio then stated the United States Air Force would release the report on this incident and it would be released in May of 1975.

343
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,940
 But the day came and went without official comment.

344
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:07,940
 And as far as I know, the U.S. Air Force has never officially recognized that event.

345
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:28,940
 Completed, sir? You're complete? Thank you very much, Sergeant Scott. Thank you. Very riveting and thank you for your service as well. Now, Captain, I won't even try to pronounce your name. Please say it for us.

346
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,940
 Fenstermacher.

347
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,940
 Fenstermacher.

348
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,940
 You're on, Captain. Thank you for coming.

349
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:48,940
 Thank you. If we have time, I have some pictures and graphics of the LCFs and the LFs and the LCCs if we have time for it. It's not really pertinent, but I thought you might like a little tour of the facilities.

350
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,940
 We have them as a slide for paper or on our screen?

351
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,940
 On the screen.

352
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
 Okay. Thank you.

353
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:02,940
 I was a captain in the Air Force and a Minuteman III combat crew commander from 1974 to 1977.

354
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:09,940
 I was stationed at FE Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming and assigned to the 400th Strategic Missile Squadron.

355
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:17,940
 Quite honestly, I was and still remain a skeptic and at the time did not believe in this UFO phenomenon.

356
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:25,940
 In the fall of '76, my deputy and I were on duty at Romeo Launch Facility, or LCF.

357
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:37,940
 The LCF was the part of Romeo that was above the ground, as we saw with David Schindley, and the launch control capsule was the one that we took an elevator down to.

358
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,940
 It was located 60 feet below the ground and behind an 8-ton door, so we were pretty secure in there.

359
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:54,940
 In order to stay awake, my deputy and I were monitoring the VHF radio communication between our security alert team, which we friendly called the COPS.

360
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:04,940
 David was one of them, David Scott, and between our flight security controller, FSC, our topside NCO.

361
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:14,940
 The SAT team was out doing their regular routine checks. I think they were responding to one of those jackrabbits at one of our launch facilities.

362
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:25,940
 So they were out and away. At approximately 2 a.m., the FSC called the SAT and said, "Hey, pull over. Get out of the vehicle and look around."

363
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,940
 That's all he said. Gave no direction or any guidance.

364
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,940
 A few seconds, and he also said, "See what you see."

365
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:41,940
 A few seconds later, they reported they saw nothing, and they said, "Oops, wait a minute. We do see something in the distance."

366
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:54,940
 The FSC, "Well, what do you see?" And they said in an excited voice, "It was a light in the sky. It was a bright white pulsating light, and they could see some other colors in between the pulsations."

367
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,940
 The FSC asked them where the light was located, and the reply was that it was some distance to the north.

368
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:06,940
 And then after a pause, they said, "Geez, it really looks like it's near the LCF or near where you are."

369
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,940
 The FSC then asked the SAT to return back to the launch control facility.

370
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,940
 My deputy and I kind of looked at each other and did a double take because what the heck was that all about?

371
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:33,940
 So we called the FSC on our hotline and asked them what was going on. He very calmly said that right now, right above the LCF, there was a silent object with a very white pulsating light between the pulsations.

372
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:42,940
 He could see a red and blue. I asked for specifics, and his best guess, well, he said it was a fat cigar. It looked like a fat cigar.

373
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:48,940
 And his best guess was that it was 80 to 100 feet above the ground and 40 to 50 feet long.

374
00:40:48,940 --> 00:41:00,940
 It was hard to see his perspective exactly because he didn't know if it was way high, it could have been 1,000 feet long. If it was way low, it could have been less, but that was his best guess.

375
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:08,940
 While we were talking, he reported that it was moving down the access road to the east and very slowly and very quietly.

376
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,940
 I asked him to keep us updated. My deputy and I talked about what we should do with this information.

377
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:25,940
 In a few minutes, the FSC called back and said the object could stop a few miles to the east and appeared to be above the closest launch facility, our LF.

378
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:39,940
 So we ordered the SAT team, who was now on their way back to the launch control facility, to go to that LF that had the object above it, and they said they had to return to the launch control facility for batteries and for their flashlights.

379
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:50,940
 Ten minutes or so later, we asked the status of the SAT team, and we were told that they made it back to the LCF, but not had departed yet. They were just about ready to go.

380
00:41:50,940 --> 00:42:03,940
 The object moved further east along the access road above another LF. We again ordered the SAT team to that location, and they reported they had the first gas up their truck.

381
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,940
 It seemed to take them a long time before they appeared to be on their way.

382
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:27,940
 Shortly after the object went to the first launch facility, we reported the incident to our SAT command post at F.E. Warren, and the NCO that took the call laughed at us and said, "Call us back when that thing eats the SAT team," and hung up.

383
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:37,940
 As well as logging everything in the official log, my deputy and I, who each had prior service, meaning we were enlisted before we were an officer,

384
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:45,940
 we started taking personal notes. In addition to the official notes, we wanted to document everything that transpired.

385
00:42:45,940 --> 00:43:00,940
 At our next hourly 400th SMS crew check for the flights Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, and Tango, we told the other crew members what our object had done and received laughter and an attitude of general disbelief.

386
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:07,940
 What are you guys crazy? Right after the group communication, the crew from Quebec called.

387
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:17,940
 They were the team we had dropped off on the way to Romeo and said that earlier that morning they had a similar object above a couple of their launch facilities.

388
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:25,940
 We asked what direction they were heading, and they said that they appeared to be heading towards me at Romeo.

389
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:33,940
 We asked what happened when they reported it, and they said, "Are you crazy? We didn't report it. We would have been laughed at."

390
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:42,940
 Well, he was right about that. They also mentioned that the SAT team that they had sent to one of the LFs had had an accident leaving the LF,

391
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:51,940
 and the Quebec crew seemed to find humor in that sad accident, and that's important for what happens a few years later.

392
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:59,940
 We contacted the FE Warren SAC command post again several times and reported, "Have you logged this yet?"

393
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:08,940
 They said, "No." I pushed it forward, got an officer in charge, and stated that if they didn't log this, if they didn't take this seriously,

394
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:17,940
 I was going to call the base commander. It was now 3 o'clock in the morning, and the base commander would have not liked getting woken at 3 o'clock, but I would have.

395
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:25,940
 Then we got a call back from a senior NCO at the command post asking for more details, so they appeared to be logging it.

396
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,940
 The object moved to another LF, and the SAT team never made it to that one either.

397
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:42,940
 Our FSC kept us to praise of each movement and reported that at 4 a.m., approximately, it moved away very rapidly to a star-sized object and then disappeared.

398
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:53,940
 At no time did our missiles go offline, though. At no time did our missiles go offline, and I now understand why. Only recent information came out for that.

399
00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:00,940
 Meanwhile, back in 1976, the next morning, we were relieved by another crew for a normal return to LFE Warren,

400
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:08,940
 and when we went topside, we found the FSC curled up in a chair in kind of a fetal position.

401
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:15,940
 He had been relieved by the day FSC, but was not able to sleep and obviously was very distressed.

402
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:24,940
 The SAT members were conveniently not at the LCF. My deputy and I were both by our service and had a good rapport with our FSC,

403
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:30,940
 and we asked him about the difficulty that the SAT team had about going to the LFs.

404
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:39,940
 After making us promise that we would not report the SAT, he told us that, in fact, they never left the launch control facility,

405
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:46,940
 and they said they were not going to any LF that had that thing above it.

406
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:55,940
 So we picked up our crew member from Quebec, and we returned trip to FE Warren and discussed the excitement of that early morning hours.

407
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:02,940
 They insisted they would not report the incident and that if we reported it, they would deny that it happened.

408
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,940
 If we reported their involvement in it, they would deny that it happened.

409
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:12,940
 Upon our return to our squadron, we reported the incident with our flight commander,

410
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:19,940
 and the next morning we were called in by the commander of the 400th SMS.

411
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:26,940
 He asked us about the incident, and when he discovered we had personal notes, he asked to see them.

412
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,940
 Once in his hands, he tore them up and said we were never to talk about this again

413
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:37,940
 and required us to sign documents that I'm a little fuzzy about what they really said.

414
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:44,940
 We reluctantly signed them after going into a broom closet to talk about it for 10 minutes.

415
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:52,940
 At our next couple of departure meetings, an officer that we'd never seen before told us that this incident was classified

416
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,940
 and that it officially never happened, and I always wanted to question which was it.

417
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,940
 Was it classified or did it happen?

418
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:08,940
 After a press conference in September 2010, I was given a name of a former Quebec SAT team that wanted to talk to me.

419
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:16,940
 I contacted and heard a story, and I'm confident he was one of the SAT members on duty that night at our incident Romeo.

420
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,940
 This is what he told me.

421
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:28,940
 As they approached the Quebec 9 in their vehicle, they saw a bright pulsating light with a beam of light extending down to the launch facility.

422
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:34,940
 While attempting to accomplishing one of their many checklists, SAT is known for their checklist,

423
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:41,940
 he actually reached into the beam. That spooked both of the SAT members, and they jumped in their truck,

424
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,940
 and as they raced away, they had an accident, and the truck was damaged.

425
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:52,940
 That tied into me that that, in fact, was the Quebec team that was on duty that night

426
00:47:52,940 --> 00:48:00,940
 when my Quebec commanders told me that their SAT team had an accident, so I was confident they were them.

427
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:10,940
 I asked, you know, when they got back to F.E. Warren, they were ridiculed by the fellow SAT members.

428
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:18,940
 Someone even drew a drawing of them seeing a UFO, hitting a cow, drinking booze, and they were ridiculed for their time,

429
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,940
 and this guy was really, to this day, upset about that ridicule.

430
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:31,940
 I asked him to share his story with others and make a formal statement, and he said, "No, this is it."

431
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,940
 He was done, and he would not talk to anybody about this again, including me,

432
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,940
 and he, in fact, has not responded to any calls or emails from me.

433
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:51,940
 I kept silence about this 1960-1976 incident. After all, a good officer follows his or her orders.

434
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:59,940
 I caught Larry King live on a Friday night on July 18th of 2008, and I came in at a segment,

435
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,940
 and I saw a former Air Force officer talking about a similar situation.

436
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,940
 I did not get the beginning of the segment, as I think I said.

437
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,940
 This guy's name was Bob Salas, and I thought he was one of the crew members from Quebec.

438
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:20,940
 He was describing my incident, you know, and then I found out, in fact, his happened in 1967.

439
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,940
 Mine, all Air Force-based, not if you are.

440
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:31,940
 A skeptic on that show did not believe Mr. Salas' story and seemed to doubt his credibility, his honesty, and his sanity.

441
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:37,940
 After much thought, much later, I contacted one of the guests on the show, Robert Hastings,

442
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,940
 and over time, it took me like four months to get up the information,

443
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:49,940
 and I slowly came out first anonymously, came forward first anonymously, first with my first name,

444
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,940
 and then I said, "What the heck? If they come after me, they come after me."

445
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,940
 Because I had the same trepidation that you did.

446
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,940
 Would I lose my pension? Would I disappear? Et cetera.

447
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:06,940
 So, here I am. This is what led to this.

448
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:17,940
 [applause]

449
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:24,940
 I served on the Armed Services Committee as well as the Air Force Academy Board for six years of my 14 years in the Congress.

450
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,940
 I know the pressure that you're under. I know when you sign those things, they're like for life.

451
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:36,940
 So, I appreciate all your courage and your service, and we all do as a body in the House of Representatives and Senate as well.

452
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,940
 So, some things they just don't know, but we're going to take it to them. Okay?

453
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,940
 [applause]

454
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,940
 Mr. Doley. Thank you, Madam Chair and committee.

455
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,940
 I am not a former member of the United States military,

456
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:57,940
 but I have devoted my life to researching the matter of UFOs and national security.

457
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:05,940
 What we know from research and archival work is that from the beginning of the atomic age,

458
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:11,940
 there have been good reports, very good reports, of unknown objects with extraordinary capabilities

459
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,940
 being in the vicinity of our most advanced nuclear facilities.

460
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:21,940
 They certainly appear to be interested, if not always tampering, definitely interested.

461
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:26,940
 We're fortunate in having obtained a few items of interest through the Freedom of Information Act.

462
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:31,940
 It's obvious that much remains beyond our reach, but what we have is definitely of interest.

463
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,940
 I'm going to describe a few of these cases to you,

464
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,940
 but first I want to describe an event that is not in a declassified document.

465
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,940
 It's a written account from a credible witness that really is quite fascinating.

466
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:50,940
 This is from a U.S. Navy officer named Byron D. Varner, who wrote a privately published book.

467
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:58,940
 It's called "Living on the Edge--An American War Hero's Daring Feats as a Navy Fighter Pilot, Civilian Test Pilot, and CIA Mercenary."

468
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,940
 There's an interesting title for you.

469
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,940
 The book includes a UFO encounter by another Navy pilot, a man named Roland Powell.

470
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:15,940
 Both of these gentlemen were interviewed at length by the then head of the Mutual UFO Network, Mr. Walter Andrus.

471
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:21,940
 Mutual UFO Network, or MUFON, is the largest civilian UFO organization in the U.S., has been for years.

472
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:31,940
 So here's what happened. In July 1945, near the close of the Pacific War, the Hanford Atomic Facility, located in the state of Washington,

473
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:38,940
 one of the key elements of America's new nuclear infrastructure was there.

474
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:46,940
 Now, although at this time no one was expecting a Japanese threat to it as the end of the war was near,

475
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:53,940
 but there were still standby aircraft armed and ready at all times just in case anything were to happen.

476
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:59,940
 At noon, on a date they don't know exactly, but it was July 1945, an alert was sounded.

477
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:06,940
 Radar had detected a fast-moving object that was now in a holding pattern directly above the Hanford plant.

478
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:12,940
 It was very high. No one was able to see it at first, only on radar.

479
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:21,940
 Six pilots flying Grumman F6F Hellcats were sent up. Finally, they saw it, and they flew to intercept it.

480
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:26,940
 It was estimated to be about 65,000 feet, very, very high up.

481
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:34,940
 No one was able to recognize it. It had what the book described as "a saucer-like appearance, bright, very fast, very high."

482
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:43,940
 The pilot, Roland Powell, later described this object to be as large as "three aircraft carriers, side-by-side, oval-shaped,

483
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:48,940
 very streamlined, like a stretched-out egg, and pinkish in color."

484
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:54,940
 He said it gave out a kind of vapor around the outside edges, he believed, from portholes or vents,

485
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:00,940
 and he speculated that the vapor was being discharged to form a cloud as a disguise.

486
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,940
 Anyway, the pilots were baffled. They were told to go higher.

487
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,940
 They replied, "If we go much higher, we're going to ruin these engines."

488
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:17,940
 And the answer came back, "Blow the engines if you have to, but use full power, full military power, full throttle injection, maximum continuous, go for it."

489
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:25,940
 They were then told that if the engines quit, they were to glide back toward the airport and hope that you make it.

490
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,940
 Even so, no one was able to get close enough to the object.

491
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:33,940
 It didn't seem to do anything. It just hovered there, as if observing, staying well enough out of reach.

492
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,940
 The pilots were quite amazed at its ability to hover.

493
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,940
 Finally, some engines, according to Roland Powell, did begin to fail.

494
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,940
 Fuel consumption got critical, and the planes returned to base.

495
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,940
 After this, the craft just disappeared as quickly as it came. It did not return.

496
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:53,940
 They had pushed their aircraft up to 42,000 feet, which was 5,000 feet above their maximum ceiling.

497
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,940
 It was very obviously a serious event. No press coverage, as you would expect.

498
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:04,940
 Now, you might argue, you might quibble that this is just a story unconfirmed by government or military documents,

499
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,940
 but it was a detailed story from an experienced World War II pilot, and you can take it for what you will.

500
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:20,940
 We do, however, have a number of declassified government documents that describe UFOs being seen over America's nuclear facilities in the early atomic era.

501
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:26,940
 Several from the FBI describe a series of events over and near Los Alamos.

502
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,940
 This is, again, another central component of America's nuclear program.

503
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:38,940
 One of these FBI documents from January 31, 1949, and then there was another from a year and a half later, in August of 1950,

504
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:48,940
 describe what you can only call an invasion of sensitive airspace repeatedly by unknown and extraordinary objects.

505
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:55,940
 So the first document gives specific dates for the initial sightings when they began in December 1948.

506
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:02,940
 In that month, they occurred on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 20th, and 28th of that month.

507
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:10,940
 The witnesses were all very high caliber. We're talking special agents of OSI, airline pilots, military pilots, Los Alamos security inspectors.

508
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:16,940
 There was some speculation that these objects might have been Soviet, but there were no reasons offered, no evidence offered.

509
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:22,940
 In fact, there's no evidence to this day. Media rights were also ruled out in this analysis.

510
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:28,940
 The initial conclusion was that they were either dealing with a previous unknown natural phenomenon or something manmade,

511
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:34,940
 except no one seemed to know any project anywhere that could have caused these sightings.

512
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,940
 And again, after more than 60 years, we still don't.

513
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:44,940
 By the way, the second of those documents referring to Los Alamos incursions, this is by August of 1950,

514
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:50,940
 stated that by then a total of 150 observations had been made.

515
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,940
 You think about it, 150 over that region in about a year and a half.

516
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:59,940
 By then, they'd been able to determine that there were three types of objects being seen.

517
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:05,940
 First was a type known as green fireballs, which were objects, this is in the words of the memo,

518
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:11,940
 moving at high speeds in shapes resembling half moons, circles, and disks emitting green light.

519
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:19,940
 The second type was a bit more of the in your face variety, that is, disks, round flat shaped objects

520
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:26,940
 or phenomena moving at fast velocity and emitting a brilliant white light or reflected light, that's the memo.

521
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:32,940
 And then the third type were meteors, which you might breathe a sigh of relief,

522
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:38,940
 except that the author then immediately says, well, aerial phenomena resembling meteoric material,

523
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,940
 moving at high velocity and varying in color.

524
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:46,940
 The colors noted were white, amber, red, and green, so quite a range.

525
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,940
 We don't know what these objects were to this day.

526
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:55,940
 Another key place where the U.S. developed its atomic technologies was at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

527
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:00,940
 Here's where the Manhattan Project had established a pilot plant to produce plutonium.

528
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,940
 UFOs were reported there as well.

529
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:09,940
 A declassified teletype from October 13, 1950, stated that the night before,

530
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:16,940
 an Air Force radar installation picked up 11 unknown objects, perhaps more, traveling across Oak Ridge.

531
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:21,940
 They were slow, low in the sky, less than 5,000 feet, maybe 1,000.

532
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,940
 Fighters were scrambled, but they saw nothing.

533
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,940
 They didn't have any explanation for this.

534
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,940
 The radar was in perfect operating condition, everyone knew their job.

535
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,940
 That was only the beginning at Oak Ridge, an FBI teletype of December 5, 1950,

536
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:40,940
 writes of six unidentified objects over Oak Ridge from the previous day.

537
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,940
 It's clear that people were scratching their heads.

538
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,940
 Some wondered if this was maybe a weather phenomenon.

539
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,940
 It doesn't appear to be because the sightings continued,

540
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:53,940
 and we get another teletype from just a few days later, December 8, from the FBI's Richmond office.

541
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,940
 Here's a quote.

542
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:00,940
 "This office very confidentially advised by Army Intelligence Richmond

543
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:10,940
 that they had been put on immediate high alert for any data whatsoever concerning flying saucers."

544
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,940
 Violations of airspace there occurred on the 15th and 16th of December, 1950,

545
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,940
 and quite a few over the next few months.

546
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,940
 And recall that this is during the Korean War.

547
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:25,940
 You have a major crisis occurring on the other side of the world, monopolizing the news

548
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,940
 and the efforts of the United States military,

549
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:31,940
 and yet you get a statement like this, that they want any information on flying saucers.

550
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,940
 You have to ask why.

551
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,940
 Odd craft were seen for quite some time over Oak Ridge.

552
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:43,940
 A fascinating document from late 1953 describes a visual sighting of a UFO seen over Oak Ridge.

553
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,940
 This is an incredible case.

554
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:53,940
 An F-86 fighter aircraft had just flown by, after which a black object was seen to appear out of a white cloud.

555
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:57,940
 It was about 12,000 to 15,000 feet altitude.

556
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:01,940
 It began to travel in large circles very rapidly for about five minutes.

557
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,940
 Sometimes it looked cigar-shaped, sometimes round.

558
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,940
 Now here, this is the report.

559
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,940
 Quote.

560
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:14,940
 "Object was extremely black in color, having an appearance of a deep black metal exterior with a fine gloss."

561
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,940
 It's quite detailed.

562
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,940
 "It did not leave a vapor trail. No sound was heard.

563
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:24,940
 The object flew east at a tremendous speed for what appeared to be three miles where it stopped.

564
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:29,940
 The object was then joined by two more of these same objects.

565
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:39,940
 A formation similar to a spread V was formed, and the objects at a tremendous speed flew in an eastward direction."

566
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,940
 Words fail me at this point. It's rather extraordinary.

567
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:48,940
 Incidentally, there's one more document describing a UFO over the Hanford nuclear plant, which I mentioned earlier.

568
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:54,940
 Well, we have an Air Force memo from August 8, 1950, which shows us that the Hanford facility continued to be of great interest.

569
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,940
 Let me just read this brief statement.

570
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:04,940
 "Since 30 July 1950, objects round in form have been sighted over the Hanford AEC plant."

571
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,940
 That's Atomic Energy Commission plan.

572
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,940
 "Air Force jets attempted interception with negative results.

573
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:23,940
 All units, including the Anti-Aircraft Battalion, radar units, Air Force fighter squadrons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, have been alerted for further observation.

574
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,940
 The Atomic Energy Commission states that the investigation is continuing."

575
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:36,940
 And by the way, there are no subsequent FOIA documents that we've gotten over what the nature of that investigation was, even though we assume it happened.

576
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,940
 So all I can say is good grief.

577
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:44,940
 Do you think they were taking this necessary, seriously, rather? Yes, I think they were.

578
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:52,940
 There are many more of these, and I'll be talking about some of those in the next panel.

579
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,940
 "I think that these are more than mere accident or coincidence.

580
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:02,940
 Anyone charged with security over these vital installations would have to take these events very seriously.

581
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:16,940
 Indeed, not to do so would be a grave violation of one's sworn duty to protect and defend such installations, and it would not be hard to see why deep secrecy would dominate the subject of UFOs."

582
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,940
 There are many other incidents regarding UFOs and nuclear installations that occurred in later years.

583
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:24,940
 As I mentioned, I'll discuss some of them shortly in the next panel.

584
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:35,940
 There's even evidence that these types of events have continued to occur much more recently, although they were a little harder to confirm due to the unresponsiveness and stonewalling of affected agencies.

585
01:02:35,940 --> 01:03:01,940
 Yet the events which took place so long ago not only demand a scientific analysis, but they also cry out to be understood for what they were, a key component in the implementation of secrecy so profound, so serious, that they contributed to the creation of a state within a state, not bound by the traditional American goals of public openness and responsiveness to the people.

586
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:05,940
 One might argue such events are so serious that the public really doesn't have a need to know.

587
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,940
 Well, I beg to differ.

588
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:15,940
 I do think that citizens in a free republic, if they are to govern, which is the basic idea, do have a need to know about the important things in their world.

589
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:16,940
 Thank you.

590
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:19,940
 Thank you very much.

591
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:20,940
 Thank you very much.

592
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,940
 Excellent.

593
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:22,940
 Excellent information.

594
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:31,940
 We're now going to open it to our members, and we're going to start with Congressman Bartlett.

595
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:58,940
 As I've sat and listened to this testimony, I was asking myself a question. If for my good, there is a cover-up of these sightings, then what else might the government do for my good?

596
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:10,940
 This is kind of Orwellian, 1984.

597
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:17,940
 Mr. Dole, what was the reference for size, because the description of one of these is different than the description of others.

598
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:18,940
 It was enormous in size.

599
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,940
 What was their reference?

600
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:30,940
 Well, when I drive down the road and I have a little speck on my windshield, it doesn't look very big, but by golly, it can obscure my vision of a whole darn car down the road.

601
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:36,940
 So perception here, you know, there has to be some reference point before you really know how big something is.

602
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:37,940
 I certainly agree, sir.

603
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,940
 References for size are notoriously inaccurate.

604
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,940
 You get this frequently.

605
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:47,940
 I assume you're referring to the first incident I mentioned, the Hanford case of 1945, where the pilots--

606
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,940
 Well, he said it was as big as a couple aircraft carriers.

607
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,940
 Yeah, I don't know how he came to that conclusion, to be perfectly honest with you.

608
01:04:53,940 --> 01:05:02,940
 You do have in the research a few confirmed, and by confirmed I simply mean radar plus visual accounts of very enormous objects.

609
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,940
 It has happened.

610
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:06,940
 It seems incomprehensible.

611
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,940
 In this particular case, I really don't know.

612
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:15,940
 He simply, to his perception at that time, it looked very enormous.

613
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:20,940
 The sightings that were talked about are all fairly old.

614
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,940
 What's happened more recently?

615
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:28,940
 Well, I don't want to jump if you had to say something, Robert.

616
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:36,940
 Recently, let's say 2010, there was a shutdown of 50 missiles at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base.

617
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,940
 This was announced by the Air Force.

618
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:48,940
 It was eventually announced that it was a computer glitch.

619
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,940
 Now, I'm very wary about that.

620
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:59,940
 I'm not sure I believe that, but we do have witnesses that have come forward, both civilian and Air Force,

621
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:03,940
 that said they saw an object in the sky at the time of these shutdowns.

622
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:08,940
 This is still being investigated, but these incidents are still going on.

623
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:12,940
 They used to be reported by the press.

624
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:16,940
 I don't see reports now in the public media.

625
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:28,940
 Do they just not report them because of the climate, the psychological climate that we're in?

626
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,940
 Or are there no sightings recently?

627
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,940
 I've seen no reports recently.

628
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,940
 Well, I'd just like to mention a couple of things with regard to that.

629
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:39,940
 It was mentioned previously in the Bentwaters panel.

630
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:43,940
 They talked about personnel reliability reporting,

631
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:51,940
 where they keep tabs on people involved with nuclear weapons and make sure they stay reliable.

632
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:58,940
 This is one way the Air Force is applying pressure not to report these things,

633
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:08,940
 but we certainly know from reports we're getting from time to time that these incidents are continuing.

634
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:17,940
 But that's one of the reasons I think Mr. Fenstermacher noted that some of their people were very reluctant to report what they saw,

635
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,940
 and I'm sure that had to do with the PRP program.

636
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:28,940
 Two points. Since all of you have followed this activity, you know,

637
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:35,940
 we're not the only country that has Minutemen missiles in holes in the ground pointed at somebody.

638
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,940
 It's the somebody that we're pointing at.

639
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:44,940
 Did they have any, as a result of the implosion of the Soviet Union, the data that came forward and a lot of their files,

640
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:54,940
 do you have any knowledge as to whether or not the Russians or the Soviets had a similar experience with their missiles?

641
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:58,940
 Anyone that wants to answer that? We'll start with Captain Scott.

642
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:04,940
 I'll start with one that I think is in my book that I've given you a copy of.

643
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:11,940
 This was an incident, I think it was 1982. It was in the Soviet Union.

644
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,940
 And it was, you know, the witnesses come forward and are named.

645
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:21,940
 And actually, I think there was an ABC special on this particular incident.

646
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:32,940
 But as I recall, UFO came over and actually started their missile on the launch sequence.

647
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,940
 And thankfully, it was shut down from that launch sequence.

648
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:41,940
 But there have been, there definitely have been sightings over Soviet bases.

649
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:48,940
 There's a large, large quantity there also of incidents where UFOs were seen over missile bases.

650
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:57,940
 Did they have the same effect that is stopping the ability of the missile to work through whatever device?

651
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:00,940
 I'm not familiar with any specific case like that.

652
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:10,940
 Okay. And Captain Fenstermacher, did you nod at your head like you had some knowledge in that?

653
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:16,940
 I saw the same report that Bob Salwas had. I saw it on ABC.

654
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:21,940
 And I've read other reports, but nothing quantifiable, you know.

655
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:29,940
 Plus, if I read reports about some of the people coming forward like we have, I wouldn't necessarily believe them, you know.

656
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,940
 But I've read reports about it.

657
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:42,940
 And instead of knocking them offline, actually it started the launch process, which really to me is more worrisome.

658
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,940
 Yeah, because they suspected us.

659
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:52,940
 But so either the launch sequence was interrupted or they backed down.

660
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:53,940
 It was initiated.

661
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:54,940
 It was initiated.

662
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,940
 Yeah.

663
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:04,940
 But apparently, it's the control mechanisms that you could still start to launch sequence,

664
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:11,940
 but the control mechanisms were the ones that were interrupted by whatever forces were in effect.

665
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:19,940
 So I was just curious that, you know, if there was a focus of attention on U.S. ICBMs,

666
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:25,940
 obviously extraterrestrial would have an interest in the Soviet ICBMs

667
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:32,940
 and also would have interest in ICBMs in the world today, not by other countries.

668
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:33,940
 At the very end of the Soviet --

669
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:34,940
 Richard, I was going to just come to you.

670
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:35,940
 Oh, I'm so sorry.

671
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:40,940
 Maybe your research -- now you've found something. This was anecdotal. Now what did you find?

672
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:44,940
 Well, in the last couple of years of the Soviet Union's existence,

673
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:51,940
 there was a remarkable amount of openness in the press from the Soviet military on this matter, quite a bit.

674
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,940
 It was like a window of opportunity, as people used to say at the time.

675
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:59,940
 And there were a number of cases, one at Kasputin Yar in 1989.

676
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:03,940
 I don't think that involved nuclear, but that was a rocket launch facility.

677
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:06,940
 There was an unknown object that appeared. It involved a jet scramble.

678
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:09,940
 It was quite extraordinary, very dramatic.

679
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:14,940
 There was a case just outside Moscow in March of 1990,

680
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,940
 which involved an unbelievable encounter by an object

681
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:25,940
 that was playing all sorts of games with the Soviet jet interceptor, seen by multiple witnesses.

682
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,940
 The Soviet minister of defense spoke about it.

683
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:31,940
 The Soviet top general for air defense spoke about it.

684
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:34,940
 They both discounted that this was American. They said, "It's not a chance."

685
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:42,940
 In fact, the top Soviet commander said, "There is no way we're ever going to try to attack this.

686
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:47,940
 It was vastly beyond anything that we or anyone we know had."

687
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,940
 So there were quite a few very dramatic cases,

688
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,940
 and there were some that involved nuclear facilities, but we don't have as much information.

689
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,940
 Thank you. My time's up.

690
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:00,940
 Thank you. Congresswoman Hooley.

691
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,940
 Thank you, Madam Chair.

692
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:09,940
 I have some questions just in general, and maybe we'll start with Captain Salas.

693
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:16,940
 These were all classified, and you took the oath that you wouldn't tell.

694
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,940
 Keep them as a secret. Why are you talking now?

695
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,940
 Thank you for asking that question.

696
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:30,940
 I did not speak about this for almost 30 years. I kept my oath.

697
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:36,940
 In 1994, I happened to pick up a book called "Above Top Secret" by Timothy Goode.

698
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:40,940
 On page 301 of that book, it stated in a very short paragraph

699
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:48,940
 that missiles were shut down in Malsom Air Force Base during UFO sighting in 1967.

700
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:54,940
 I immediately thought that that was my incident because it described it fairly well,

701
01:12:54,940 --> 01:13:02,940
 and I decided to go ahead and request, under the Freedom of Information Act,

702
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,940
 information about that specific incident.

703
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:11,940
 They were talking about the echo flight shutdown because I thought that was my incident.

704
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:15,940
 So I didn't mention anything about UFOs when we sent the inquiry.

705
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:25,940
 I just asked for, well, actually my researcher, James Klotz, who was with MUFON at the time,

706
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:28,940
 requested this information under FOIA.

707
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:32,940
 The Air Force wrote back and said, you know, this incident is classified.

708
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:38,940
 However, because of the time lapse, we're going to declassify it.

709
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:44,940
 And so they did. They declassified the echo shutdown incident, and they started sending me documents.

710
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:53,940
 So I started speaking about it at that point because I thought at that point that that's where I was

711
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:57,940
 because you have to understand all these facilities look pretty much the same.

712
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:01,940
 I knew I wasn't in the same squadron as Echo,

713
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:07,940
 but I did know that at times we did help out when they were short on crews.

714
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:17,940
 It wasn't until 1996 when I contacted my commander, Fred Mywall, that I realized I was at Oscar flight.

715
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:25,940
 And then I realized I'd been speaking out of turn, so to speak,

716
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:31,940
 because I had violated my oath by not speaking about my specific incident.

717
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:40,940
 I made a decision to continue speaking about it, and I've been speaking about it ever since.

718
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:43,940
 I've never been harried by the Air Force.

719
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:48,940
 Nobody's ever knocked on my door and said, can't talk about it.

720
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:51,940
 So I continue to speak about it.

721
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:53,940
 Well, we're glad you do.

722
01:14:53,940 --> 01:15:01,940
 For any one of you, I think so often when we hear the initial UFO,

723
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:10,940
 we always think of it as somewhere outer space, don't know, this is a huge universe, where they come from.

724
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:17,940
 Do you think they're from somewhere in outer space,

725
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:29,940
 or do you think these are made by some country that we, in our little universe, that we know about?

726
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:30,940
 Tell me what you think.

727
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:34,940
 Madam, these are questions that not only private researchers have been asking,

728
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:37,940
 but also classified researchers have been asking.

729
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:43,940
 When you go back through the history that we know of, back in the late 1940s,

730
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:49,940
 when this first appeared on the scene within the Air Force, there were competing solutions to this problem.

731
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:54,940
 Right off the bat, you had analysts who were convinced that there was no possible way

732
01:15:54,940 --> 01:16:00,940
 that this could have been Soviet manufacture or American, that the performance capabilities were too advanced.

733
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:04,940
 There were other people who did suspect the Soviet Union.

734
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:07,940
 In fact, during the incident over Los Alamos that I mentioned earlier,

735
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:14,940
 there was speculation, wondering, could this have been a Soviet type of technology?

736
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,940
 There's just no evidence for that.

737
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:26,940
 We all realize that within the black budget world, there are vastly advanced types of technologies in various ways.

738
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:33,940
 In many cases, NSA computing, for example, is at least three decades ahead of the rest of the world.

739
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:38,940
 At least they were in the 1960s, and they probably still are.

740
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:44,940
 There are other black budget groups that have, who knows what they have.

741
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:46,940
 That's always a thing.

742
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:52,940
 If you were to see a perfectly hovering triangle, and there are triangular UFOs hovering above you today,

743
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:55,940
 you'd have to ask yourself, is this ours or theirs?

744
01:16:55,940 --> 01:17:01,940
 This is one of the fundamental questions that serious research asks these days,

745
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,940
 because it's very difficult.

746
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:09,940
 I will just offer my own opinion that a large portion of these objects are not ours.

747
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:14,940
 I think that's what you find when you speak with individuals within the classified world.

748
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,940
 I've been privileged to do that many, many times.

749
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:21,940
 Some extremely prominent individuals, if I may say, and that is their opinion as well.

750
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,940
 Thank you.

751
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,940
 Thank you, Congresswoman.

752
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:29,940
 Congressman Cook, please.

753
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:35,940
 Congressman Fenstermacher, unlike some of the other testimony here today,

754
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:40,940
 you said that you didn't wait too long before you started talking about it.

755
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:43,940
 Am I correct in understanding that?

756
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:46,940
 I just came forward after I saw Bob Salazar.

757
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:47,940
 Oh, excuse me.

758
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:49,940
 I misunderstood that then.

759
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:56,940
 I just want to say I would commend all of you for coming out with your statements.

760
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:02,940
 And I certainly understand the reasons why for many, many years you may be reluctant.

761
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:10,940
 But had you -- I thought I had heard something that I misheard, obviously.

762
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:20,940
 But the reason I'm asking this is because I want to ask you all each about the Air Force Project Blue Book.

763
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:27,940
 Blue Book was being done -- you know, there's a lot of money spent on Project Blue Book by the Air Force

764
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:31,940
 during, what, the '47 to '69 period.

765
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:36,940
 And some of your events occurred that you've talked about, certainly that you saw as your event,

766
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:42,940
 occurred while Blue Book was still being funded and written about.

767
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:47,940
 And Blue Book is, as I understand it, totally published now.

768
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,940
 It's out.

769
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,940
 And let me make sure I understand.

770
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:57,940
 I think the ear of your -- what you saw witnessed --

771
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:58,940
 Seventy-six.

772
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,940
 Seventy-six.

773
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:01,940
 And again --

774
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:02,940
 Seventy-four.

775
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:03,940
 Seventy-four.

776
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:04,940
 Seventy-six.

777
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:05,940
 Seventy-six.

778
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:16,940
 So both the two captains right directly in front of me here, the things that you saw,

779
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,940
 is there any indication in Project Blue Book about those?

780
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:25,940
 Or were you ever contacted in regards -- I take it you were never contacted in regards to Project Blue Book at the time?

781
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:28,940
 Or am I wrong on that?

782
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:31,940
 Or by anybody in the Air Force that was telling you that that's what they were doing?

783
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:37,940
 They were gathering -- I realize they may take your statements and not tell you why they're taking them.

784
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:43,940
 So the only thing they did with me is shove a piece of paper in my face and told me to sign it.

785
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:46,940
 I never heard another word about it afterwards.

786
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:53,940
 In researching -- I've been researching this subject for 18, 19 years now.

787
01:19:53,940 --> 01:20:01,940
 And recently I discovered that Project Blue Book had secret files.

788
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:07,940
 They had two sets of files, one available to the public and a set of secret files.

789
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:12,940
 And so again, I've got evidence of this.

790
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:24,940
 So no, when the Conant investigator came to Malmstrom Air Force Base to talk to our deputy base commander, Colonel Chase,

791
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:31,940
 Colonel Chase said this was a classified incident, you could not review the report.

792
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:37,940
 So they put it in a classified Blue Book file at the time.

793
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:43,940
 And do you have any feeling on the same question, Captain Schindl?

794
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:48,940
 At the time I knew nothing about Blue Book per se.

795
01:20:48,940 --> 01:21:00,940
 I do recall an incident or instance during my time at Minot where there was some discussion among some crew members about Blue Book.

796
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:09,940
 But I never knew what that was at the time until 40 years later.

797
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:14,940
 And then I find out about Blue Book and then I find out about this article in the Saturday Evening Post.

798
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:17,940
 And I find out about Val Smith, who's in my squadron.

799
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:22,940
 And then I find out about released documents from the Air Force that mention his name.

800
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:26,940
 And now I understand that's where the talk about Blue Book came from.

801
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:36,940
 It's very likely that not too many people in the Air Force, even captains and colonels and everything else, even generals, knew that much about Blue Book.

802
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:37,940
 Am I right?

803
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:41,940
 I imagine that you've reviewed some of what's in Blue Book since.

804
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:53,940
 I mean, recently, for example, is there anything in Blue Book that's been published now that would indicate anything close to what you saw in Montana

805
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:59,940
 or in North Dakota, Minot, or in Wyoming or in the other?

806
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:00,940
 Have you looked at that?

807
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:02,940
 In other words?

808
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:03,940
 No, sir.

809
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:04,940
 Okay.

810
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:10,940
 And do any of you have any feeling as to why Blue Book, why they stopped Blue Book?

811
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:16,940
 Or do you have any, can you give us your opinion, totally opinion, of why Blue Book was discontinued?

812
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,940
 Yes, Mr. Cook.

813
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:21,940
 I alluded to it in my statement.

814
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:27,940
 The Condon investigation, which was supposed to look into the UFO question for the Air Force, was a whitewash.

815
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:35,940
 It was intended to allow the Air Force to wash its hands of the UFO question.

816
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:53,940
 And I have evidence of that. The evidence that I have is the fact that Dr. Craig, who was the chief investigator for Condon, was given information about the Echo and Oscar flight shutdowns. He was given names and dates, et cetera.

817
01:22:53,940 --> 01:23:08,940
 And never followed up on it. The Condon investigators never followed up on it. Robert Lowe never followed up on it. It was never mentioned. And that's because it was classified.

818
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:14,940
 I would like to just answer your question very quickly. I can give you the quick lowdown on Blue Book.

819
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:21,940
 Blue Book was formed in 1952 as a result of a tremendous upsurge in UFO sightings that were happening at that time.

820
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:27,940
 That was the only time in Blue Book's history that they actually had a staff that was capable of doing investigations. They had about 12 people.

821
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:32,940
 Their percentage of unknowns for that year was quite high. It was almost 25 percent.

822
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:40,940
 The order came down after the CIA sponsored Robertson Panel, which was at the very end of the Truman administration, to say, that's too high.

823
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:57,940
 That this problem is too big and we need to knock UFOs out of the public mind. And Blue Book was then gutted and stripped of really all capabilities. And for the rest of its existence, it had no more than a staff of about four or five people with no capability and on strict orders.

824
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:12,940
 This is an explicit Air Force order of 1954-55 saying you are required to get your number of unknowns down to a bare minimum. And they did that by hook or crook. Didn't matter. So it became very much a kind of an open joke, to be quite frank.

825
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:20,940
 The Blue Book explanations were generally not considered very valid because they were not sufficiently investigated in any scientific way.

826
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:28,940
 Chair, one quick follow-up question that will take ten seconds to answer.

827
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:49,940
 Is your opinion then, Mr. Dolan, that the Air Force is more reluctant even today than they were during that period of '52 to '67 to even talk about or discuss or take information from captains and sergeants and colonels and even generals, any kind of pilots and so on, than they were then?

828
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:55,940
 Absolutely, I believe that. This is a complete nightmare for them to deal with.

829
01:24:55,940 --> 01:25:20,940
 Our final presenter before our break, our ten minute break or so, will be Congresswoman Wolsey. Well, I was sitting here, thank you, all five of you, and Steve who was there before you, getting really uncomfortable about the position this has put you in all these years.

830
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:31,940
 And honoring you in my heart for getting past that and getting here today and knowing that was not an easy thing to do.

831
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:43,940
 But I wanted to then reflect back on why is this panel, why are we all retired members of Congress?

832
01:25:43,940 --> 01:26:03,940
 Well, you know what? We don't have a lot to lose. But it would be, this would be one of the issues that a sitting member would risk losing an election over.

833
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:17,940
 60 second, I mean, ad. And clearance, yeah, to find out data that you have to have clearance for.

834
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:46,940
 And but then that was the third piece of this is to me and I feel maybe I'm being too optimistic. I think this week is going to change the feeling and respect that the common constituent, the regular member of our country, the population, the populace.

835
01:26:46,940 --> 01:27:00,940
 I think if they pay any attention to this, they are going to have a different respect for it. And they'll be able to say it.

836
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:16,940
 Instead of whispering to me, people who knew that I get teased a lot because I'm the one of the most left progressive members that have left the house, but that was in the house.

837
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:27,940
 And so my constituents, they're really supportive of me. Lucky me. But they would come in and they would whisper, you know, Congresswoman, I think there's something to this.

838
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:43,940
 And I would say, well, if it is or isn't, I'm going to go and find out why we can't find out. And they can count on, you know, that I would do that. But I'm not sure I would have done it if I was a sitting member. I have to be honest with you.

839
01:27:43,940 --> 01:28:01,940
 Ms. Woolsey, may I make a comment? For the last year, we have been sending documents, myself and Mr. Victor Bigliani of Zeeland Communications have been sending documents to Representative Peter King of New York.

840
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:09,940
 He's got all the documents. He's got my book. He knows my story, but he has not acted on it.

841
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:18,940
 I've also briefed Congressman Rohrabacher, a congressman from California. I think he's still in Congress.

842
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:19,940
 Yes, he is.

843
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:26,940
 I briefed him, I think it was the year 2000, and he still hasn't acted on this.

844
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:30,940
 Well, there's 433 other members that haven't acted also.

845
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:51,940
 So I hope that this week could make it more comfortable for them and maybe help put the pressure on our government to be more open and to stop covering up and having secret files. So I thank you very much for being here.

846
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:54,940
 Thank you very much.

847
01:28:54,940 --> 01:29:01,940
 We're going to take a short 8, 10 minute stretch or break for a moment and when we come back we'll conclude for the afternoon.
