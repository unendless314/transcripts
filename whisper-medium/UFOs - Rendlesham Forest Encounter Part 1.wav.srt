1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth to this committee

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,660
 today. Thank you very much. And welcome to our visitors and presenters this morning.

3
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,880
 I'm going to start at the right and have each member take 30 seconds just to introduce yourself.

4
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,680
 We have our counselor on the end who was an excellent expert witness yesterday. Would you

5
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:55,080
 get about 15 seconds please open up with introductions. We have new people in the room. So yes. Identify

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:03,480
 us. Yes. My name is Dan Sheehan. I'm general counsel for the committee and I've been involved

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,560
 in this for about 20 years probably in these kind of hearings since representing Dr. John

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,040
 Mack in front of the Harvard Faculty Committee and prior to that time had participated as

9
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,020
 I mentioned in the preparation of a special report from the Congressional Research Service

10
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:26,940
 to President Carter on this issue back in 1977. Thank you very much sir. Madam Congresswoman.

11
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,940
 Yes I'm Congresswoman Darlene Hooley. Left Congress four years ago. Had a wonderful experience

12
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,160
 while I was there. It was an amazing thing to do. And I am back home in Oregon and have

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:50,240
 a business and delighted that I was invited. I served on the science committee. Delighted

14
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,400
 that I was invited to attend these meetings and I will tell you yesterday was spectacular.

15
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,360
 Really appreciate all the witnesses. And I learned something new. It was fascinating

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:09,920
 to me. Thank you. Thank you. My name is Mike Ravel. Senator from Alaska for two terms.

17
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,040
 Been out of office for 40 years. So but I found the hearings absolutely very interesting

18
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,560
 edifying and I really want to congratulate those who put this conference on. Thank you.

19
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,560
 I'm Roscoe Bartlett. I had the great honor of serving Maryland's sixth district in the

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,560
 Congress for 20 years. I didn't come to the Congress until I was 66 years old. So obviously

21
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,520
 I had a life before that. I have a Ph.D. I worked for the military. Various, every way

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,920
 you can work for the military for 20 years before I came to the Congress. Taught medical

23
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,200
 school. Really a great honor to serve and really pleased that I was asked to be a part

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,320
 of this activity. Thank you. Congresswoman. I'm Lynn Woolsey from just across the Golden

25
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:02,880
 Gate Bridge from San Francisco. Retired four months now after 20 years in Congress. And

26
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,780
 served the entire 20 years on the science committee and on the education and labor committee

27
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:19,120
 and find this issue that we're talking about this week absolutely stimulating and important.

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:30,200
 Not just the extraterrestrial piece of it, but mainly the governance and knowing what's

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,440
 going on in our government and comparing with other governments. So I too am honored that

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,160
 I was asked to be part of this. Thank you. Congressman. I'm Merrill Cook. I had the great

31
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,700
 opportunity to serve the state of Utah as a congressman from the second district which

32
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,720
 is basically the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. I, among other committees, I was pleased

33
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,480
 to serve on the science, the space subcommittee and the aviation subcommittee. Thank you.

34
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,360
 Need no introduction on the end Mr. Bookman. I'm Dr. Joseph Bookman. I held a PhD from

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,040
 Indiana University. I ran for Congress in 2008 as a Libertarian. I'm currently the chair

36
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,000
 of the Libertarian Party's platform committee. And I serve as a researcher for the Paradigm

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,960
 Research Group. Thank you. And I'm Congresswoman Carolyn Kilpatrick. 14 years in the House

38
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,160
 of Representatives. 12 on the Appropriations Committee. First African American woman to

39
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,600
 serve on the Defense Appropriations Committee which was a thrill. And served on the Air

40
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,500
 Force Academy Board for five or six years in that time. So you have here over 80 years

41
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,560
 of service and public service and giving. And I want to tell you to a person some of

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,960
 the best. So the, again, to commend staff for putting this together. I know you guys

43
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,480
 have been in it 30, 40, 50, 60 years and up. We're neophytes and we're here to learn and

44
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,880
 to hopefully take back something so that we can move forward like the rest of the world

45
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:01,720
 on this topic. Okay, Mr. Pope, thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair, fellow committee members.

46
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,760
 My name is Nick Pope, formerly of the British Ministry of Defense. I had responsibility

47
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,360
 for the UFO issue from 1991 to 1994. And with your permission I'm just going to read a brief

48
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,600
 statement onto the record. The United Kingdom's best known and most compelling UFO incident

49
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,240
 is a series of sightings that occurred in December 1980 and are collectively known as

50
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,440
 either the Rendlesham Forest incident or the Bentwaters incident. The sightings took place

51
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,080
 near the twin military bases of Bentwaters and Woodbridge. These were bases in the United

52
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,600
 Kingdom operated by the United States Air Force. There were several dozen military witnesses,

53
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,680
 the most senior of whom was the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Holt.

54
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,000
 I'll give a brief summary of events as I see them before focusing on events aspects of

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,040
 the case on which I have more direct knowledge. On December 26, 1980, two members of the United

56
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,560
 States Air Force, my colleagues John Burroughs and Jim Penniston here, who had been sent

57
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:16,120
 to investigate a suspected crashed civilian aircraft, encountered an unknown craft which

58
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,440
 had apparently landed in a small clearing. One of them got close enough to see strange

59
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,960
 hieroglyphic symbols on the side and indeed to touch it. The craft rose slowly above the

60
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,080
 trees and then accelerated away at great speed. A subsequent analysis of the landing site

61
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,760
 showed indentations in the ground, scorch marks on the sides of the trees and radiation

62
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:47,080
 levels which the Ministry of Defence's Defence Intelligence staff assessed as being significantly

63
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,860
 higher than the average background. The committee will have a small pack of papers including

64
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:00,580
 that Defence Intelligence staff assessment. The UFO was briefly tracked on military radar.

65
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,000
 Two nights later the UFO returned and fired light beams at the deputy base commander and

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,880
 a small team of men who had gone to investigate. It later fired light beams at a particularly

67
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,760
 sensitive area of the military base. Though these events happened many years before I

68
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,320
 joined the Ministry of Defence, it was a case that was raised with me on numerous occasions

69
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,920
 during my time working on MOD's UFO project between 1991 and 1994. It was certainly the

70
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,520
 case on which I received most inquiries from UK parliamentarians, from the media and indeed

71
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,080
 from the public. So as to be able to better respond to these questions I not only read

72
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,960
 all the relevant papers on the case but also launched a retrospective review of the incident,

73
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,560
 something akin to what the police would call a cold case review. Subsequent to this I've

74
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,120
 met in a private capacity most of the witnesses to this incident. Investigations by the United

75
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,440
 Kingdom were inconclusive. I do not know the results of the US investigations because as

76
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,000
 the MOD documents released under the UK's Freedom of Information Act show some evidence

77
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,840
 was removed by the US authorities without informing the British government. Specifically

78
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,560
 the MOD case file reveals and the committee members will have this document too, that

79
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,040
 shortly after the incident General Gabriel visited the twin bases of Bentwaters and Woodbridge,

80
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,080
 was briefed on the incident and took various items relating to the investigation back to

81
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,920
 his headquarters in Ramstein, Germany. At the time General Gabriel held the post of

82
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,920
 Commander in Chief, United States Air Force in Europe. The MOD document concerned though

83
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,240
 carefully worded leaves little doubt that the UK authorities were less than pleased

84
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,960
 with evidence being removed in this way, with the MOD not being informed at the time and

85
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,960
 not so far as I'm aware being briefed subsequently on the conclusions of whatever United States

86
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,960
 Air Force and or Department of Defence investigation followed General Gabriel's visit.

87
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,640
 My cold case review showed that General Gabriel's removal of the evidence was one of a number

88
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,520
 of factors that adversely affected the contemporaneous investigation. A combination of confusion

89
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,760
 over jurisdiction, i.e. between the UK and the US authorities, delay and poor information

90
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,760
 sharing fatally undermine the original investigation. Part of the problem was that the US investigation

91
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,840
 was in of itself a direct contradiction of the US government's public line on UFOs,

92
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,640
 namely that the subject is of no official interest and that no official investigations

93
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,320
 took place after the termination of the USAF's investigative program, Project Bluebird, at

94
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:00,360
 the end of 1969. This clearly put senior United States Air Force officers in an extremely

95
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,520
 difficult position and it was clear to me that the US authorities wished to hand the

96
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,000
 investigation off to the British while the Ministry of Defence was equally keen to see

97
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,480
 the Americans take the lead. The confusion over precisely what happened at the time is

98
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,240
 compounded by the fact that some Ministry of Defence Defence Intelligence staff UFO files

99
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,760
 covering the time period of the Rendlesham Forest incident have been destroyed, seemingly

100
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,600
 without proper authorisation. While I'm aware that this action has generated some conspiracy

101
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,560
 theories, I'm not aware of any evidence that suggests this was a deliberate attempt to

102
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,480
 hide information, though I know that some people dispute that point. While some internal

103
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,640
 Ministry of Defence emails expressed delight at the loss of these files, my assessment

104
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,460
 is that these were unfortunate remarks by comparatively junior staff and were motivated

105
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,920
 by nothing more sinister than the relief of not having to respond to further Freedom of

106
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,640
 Information Act requests for the documents. By the Ministry of Defence's own admission,

107
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,480
 there was no definitive explanation for the Rendlesham Forest incident and the case remains

108
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,880
 unexplained to this day. However, when pressed to make a statement on the incident, MOD consistently

109
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,640
 said that the events were judged to be of no defence significance, quote unquote, a

110
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,320
 catch-all soundbite that the MOD consistently used with all UFO sightings explained or unexplained.

111
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,240
 In this way, MOD could justify taking no further action, whatever the circumstances of a case.

112
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,000
 It's worth quoting in conclusion the assessment of Lord Hill Norton, retired five-star admiral

113
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,280
 who was former chief of the defence staff and former chairman of NATO's Military Committee.

114
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,560
 Commenting on MOD's no defence significance line on Rendlesham Forest, Lord Hill Norton

115
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,720
 said, "My position, both privately and publicly expressed over the last dozen years or more,

116
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,460
 is that there are only two possibilities, either (a) an intrusion into our airspace

117
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:14,160
 and a landing by unidentified craft took place at Rendlesham as described, or (b) the deputy

118
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,960
 base commander of an operational nuclear-armed US Air Force base in England and a large number

119
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,740
 of his enlisted men were either hallucinating or lying." It's difficult to disagree with

120
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,480
 that assessment. In the course of my cold case review, I examined

121
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,360
 critically all the various theories that thought to explain the sightings in conventional terms

122
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,680
 as misidentification, hoax or delusions. None of these theories fitted the facts. Most people,

123
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,560
 whatever their views on the UFO mystery, have probably heard of the alleged crash of a UFO

124
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,320
 at Roswell. Arguably, in the Rendlesham Forest incident, we have a UFO incident more recent,

125
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,480
 better documented and better evidence than the Roswell incident. Thank you, Madame Chair.

126
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,480
 Thank you very much. I want to now yield to Patrick. I don't want to mispronounce your

127
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,400
 name and I appreciate you having your testimony to us last night.

128
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,000
 Thank you, Mr. Frescona. Please proceed. Madame Chair, my name is Patrick Frescona.

129
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,560
 I am legal counsel to James Penniston and John Burroughs, both of whom proudly and passionately

130
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,320
 served our country in the United States Air Force. Mr. Burroughs and Mr. Penniston are

131
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,560
 seated with me this morning along with Nick Pope, formerly with the United Kingdom's Ministry

132
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,320
 of Defense. Mr. Pope has been a long-time advocate for full disclosure of the events

133
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,600
 for which we will discuss today. For me, it is indeed nothing short of an honor to be

134
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,600
 seated beside these gentlemen. Thirty-three years ago at the zenith of the Cold War in

135
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,040
 1980, Staff Sergeant James Penniston and Airman First Class John Burroughs were assigned to

136
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,200
 the twin Royal Air Force bases of Bentwaters and Woodbridge near Suffolk, England. At that

137
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,880
 time, RAF Bentwaters and Woodbridge were leased by the United Kingdom to the U.S. Air Force.

138
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,440
 Together, the twin bases were home to the largest tactical fighter wing in existence

139
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,880
 anywhere in the world at that time. James Penniston held U.S. as well as NATO security

140
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,280
 clearances and was responsible for the protection of sophisticated war-making assets in addition

141
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:26,880
 to the personnel located at the bases. By December of 1980, he was the senior security

142
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,560
 officer in charge of base security at the twin base facility. After midnight on December

143
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,040
 26, 1980, Airman Burroughs along with Staff Sergeant Bud Steffens were on patrol. Together,

144
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,960
 when they noticed strange lights emanating from just outside the east gate of the Bentwaters

145
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,120
 base in the adjacent Rendlesham Forest. Mr. Burroughs had been stationed at the twin base

146
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,720
 facility for nearly two years and had never seen such an unusual phenomenon previously

147
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:02,800
 in the forest. Sergeant Steffens and Airman Burroughs telephoned Central Security Control,

148
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,920
 Tennessee from the kiosk at the east gate to report the unidentified lights just beyond

149
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,160
 the bases perimeter. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Penniston was briefed by Staff Sergeant Steffens

150
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,920
 regarding the strange lights that they had seen. Mr. Penniston was further informed that

151
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,280
 the lights did not result from a crash but had landed in the forest. This is a remark

152
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,000
 he discounted by Sergeant Steffens and proceeded to notify the base control center that there

153
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,080
 was instead a possible downed aircraft. Mr. Penniston also learned that an object had

154
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:43,360
 been seen on radar over Rendlesham Forest. Moreover, a call came over his radio that

155
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,960
 eastern radar had also confirmed an object that disappeared from their screens over the

156
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,400
 forest. The team Mr. Penniston assembled to investigate the lights in the forest consisted

157
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,200
 of himself, Airman Burroughs, and Airman Ed Kabancik. As he and the rest of the team approached

158
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,120
 the forest, they experienced uncharacteristic problems with their radios. As a result, Mr.

159
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,160
 Penniston instructed Airman Kabancik to remain at the edge of the forest to act as a relay

160
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,760
 for transmissions between he and Mr. Burroughs as they entered the forest themselves. As

161
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,080
 these two gentlemen proceeded into the forest, they were expecting to find a downed aircraft.

162
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,000
 Upon arriving at the suspected crash site, it immediately became apparent to both Penniston

163
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,760
 and Burroughs that they were not looking at a crashed aerial vehicle or, for that matter,

164
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,200
 any kind of vehicle they had ever seen. Suddenly, a blinding flash of white light emanated from

165
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,880
 that craft, instinctively causing Airman Burroughs, excuse me, Mr. Penniston and Burroughs to

166
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,200
 drop to the ground. As both men returned to their feet, they witnessed a triangular craft

167
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,720
 approximately nine feet long by six and a half feet wide at rest in a small clearing

168
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,760
 in the forest. Also observed were blue and yellow lights swirling around the exterior

169
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,920
 skin of the craft as if they were part of the craft's skin itself. The air in the vicinity

170
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,160
 of the craft felt electrically charged and was in fact so full of static electricity

171
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,080
 they could feel it all over their clothes, skin and throughout their hair. Nothing, absolutely

172
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:27,320
 nothing in the military training of these men had prepared them for this encounter.

173
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,080
 After perhaps ten minutes had passed without any recognizable aggression displayed by the

174
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,400
 craft, Mr. Penniston concluded there was no threat to either himself or Mr. Burroughs

175
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,720
 and the rest of his response team or, more importantly, to the Bentwaters base itself.

176
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,040
 Consequently, he commenced a thorough on-site inspection of the craft in accordance with

177
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,480
 the usual security protocols. His inspection of the craft included photographs, notebook

178
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:00,360
 entries and radio contact with Airman Kubancik for relay back to the Bentwaters Control Center.

179
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,640
 Mr. Penniston noted a row of symbols which was two and a half feet long and about three

180
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,760
 inches in height on one side of the craft. The symbols Mr. Penniston saw were pictorial

181
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,120
 and hieroglyphic like in design, the largest one being a triangle which was centered in

182
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:25,200
 the middle of others. All of the symbols were etched into the skin of the craft which was

183
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,060
 self-warmed to the touch and smooth as glass. Approximately 45 minutes after arriving on

184
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,600
 scene with the craft, it rapidly began to brighten. In response, both Penniston and

185
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,640
 Burroughs took defensive positions away from it and watched as the craft became airborne

186
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,420
 without generating any air or sound disturbance. The craft maneuvered through the trees as

187
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:53,960
 it ascended skyward then streaked away at an unbelievable rate of speed. In fact, Mr.

188
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:01,320
 Penniston described the craft's departure speed in his field notes as impossible. The

189
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,720
 craft's departure from the forest was observed not only by Mr. Penniston and Burroughs but

190
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,400
 by more than 40 Air Force personnel, all of whom were trained observers assigned to the

191
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,120
 81st Security Police Squadron. The information acquired during Penniston and Burroughs' investigation

192
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,200
 in the forest was dutifully reported by them through normal military channels. Their team

193
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,120
 and other personnel who witnessed the craft were instructed to treat the investigation

194
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,420
 as top secret and not to discuss what they had seen. The camera film containing photographs

195
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,480
 of the craft Mr. Penniston took were turned into the base lab but when he picked them

196
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,260
 up they were strangely all overexposed rendering them useless. Add to this oddity that following

197
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,160
 the encounter in the forest both Penniston and Burroughs were interrogated by government

198
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,840
 agents believed to be from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations in which narcotics

199
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,500
 were even given them prior to interrogation as if they were some kind of enemy captives.

200
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,640
 The previous description of the encounter Jim Penniston and John Burroughs had in Rendlesham

201
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:14,440
 Forest in late December of 1980 was not solitary. John Burroughs would join Colonel Charles

202
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,760
 Halt on another investigation in the forest two nights subsequent when an illuminated

203
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,840
 craft moved silently through the forest before becoming multiple aerial objects overhead.

204
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,960
 Colonel Halt generated an official Air Force memorandum commonly referred to as the Halt

205
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,280
 Memo in which he memorializes this event. Moreover the Colonel has even stood in this

206
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:46,160
 very room we are in today and said he believed the objects were under intelligent control.

207
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,360
 Jim Penniston and John Burroughs both began suffering from physical ailments after their

208
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,400
 encounter in the forest. Ailments which did not exist prior to joining the Air Force but

209
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,460
 ailments which began almost immediately after exposure to the craft in the forest. These

210
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,540
 ailments have persisted in both men to this day. In 2011 I began assisting both gentlemen

211
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,760
 in propounding Freedom of Information Act requests on the Central Intelligence Agency,

212
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,080
 National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Department of the Air Force, Defense

213
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,840
 Advanced Research Projects Agency via the Department of Defense, Air Force Office of

214
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,140
 Special Investigations, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. All of the previously

215
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,840
 listed divisions of our government responded to our inquiries for information regarding

216
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,680
 John and Jim by essentially saying they had nothing on file about them. The one exception

217
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,360
 is the CIA's response which was the most frustrating of them all by their stating that

218
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,520
 they could neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of records responsive to

219
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:56,000
 our request. In other words none of the governmental entities we contacted, those we just named,

220
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,740
 even the Air Force seemed to know anything about a John Burroughs or a Jim Penniston

221
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,680
 despite the fact that we're all fairly certain they served in the United States Air Force

222
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,320
 for many years. We have repeatedly sought to obtain the medical records of John's and

223
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,320
 Jim's default requests but have yet to succeed. John's physicians in particular have requested

224
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,000
 his service medical records especially those related to what it was he and Jim came into

225
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,480
 contact with in the forest. They have requested this information time and time again from

226
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,760
 John in order to provide the best chance to treat his medical problems which have at times

227
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,720
 been life-threatening. We even enlisted the help of a former senator from John's home

228
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,480
 state of Arizona but still did not get anything other than learning that the Veterans Administration

229
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:56,800
 has a classified records section. In closing I want to say that in December of 1980 I was

230
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:05,240
 thousands of miles away from Rendlesham Forest studying in college. I was completely unaware

231
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,920
 of the incident. I was completely unaware of these gentlemen. It would not be but for

232
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:20,120
 another 28 years in 2008 that I would first encounter that incident and become aware of

233
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,200
 it. But once I learned of their story I felt compelled to assist them however I could as

234
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,200
 this was an event of tremendous fascination, importance and one with casualties too. It

235
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,080
 has been cowardly the way their requests for medical records and the like have been rejected

236
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,040
 using excuses like we have no records responsive to your request or the requested records are

237
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,400
 no longer under our purview. Nevertheless we continue undaunted in our search for these

238
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,480
 gentleman's medical records so that their physicians may properly treat them as John

239
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,920
 Burroughs once said to me Jim and I have been left behind on the battlefield of the Cold

240
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:07,160
 War. Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you very much for the both of your testimonies. It's

241
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:13,320
 very hard to explain why a country this great can treat our military so poorly. I want to

242
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,640
 yield now to Mr. Pennington. Sergeant are you prepared? Thank you madam. I appreciate

243
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:27,960
 that all of you are here today and I look forward to your questions and I'll try to

244
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,640
 answer them as honestly as I can. It's been 32 years though. There's a few gray areas

245
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:42,120
 that I can't recall on so I'll try to answer them as best as I can and keep it strictly

246
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:49,400
 to the facts. Thank you. Thank you sir and thank you for your service. Sergeant Burroughs.

247
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,580
 Thank you madam. My name is Tech Sergeant John Burroughs, United States retired. In

248
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,720
 December 1980 I was assigned to the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at Aria Bentwaters which at the

249
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,120
 time was the largest tech fighter wing in the United States Air Force. During the opening

250
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,320
 day of testimony you were exposed to the history of UFOs and the cover up that's taking place.

251
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,280
 Today you will be hearing from military personnel who are involved in some of these incidents.

252
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,160
 One of the factors that I feel is being overlooked is the human toll that takes place with the

253
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,880
 witnesses that are involved in these incidents. Our job was to investigate and report back

254
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,400
 in what we observed. What we were not prepared for is what happened to us afterwards. In

255
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,600
 our case we were not only let down by our chain of command but there's also evidence

256
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,440
 showing that we were brought in and interrogated by OSI and other agencies. What you're about

257
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,280
 to hear is what happened to us in the forest, the investigation took place afterwards and

258
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,920
 the evidence showing our incident is still classified 32 years later. Thank you. Were

259
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:58,520
 there other witnesses of this craft other than the two of you? Yes, on the first night

260
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,320
 there was a security flight that was working and then also a law enforcement flight that

261
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,120
 was working and that totaled somewhere between 40 and 60 people at varied. It was over the

262
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,000
 Christmas holidays plus we had a number of civilian witnesses that came forward later

263
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,200
 on. Were there any but you two who were close to the craft and saw it on the ground or do

264
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:31,280
 the others simply see it leaving and coming? On Bentwaters, the bases are two bases that

265
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,080
 are geographically separated by three miles of Wurundjerum Forest. The main operating

266
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,720
 base is on Bentwaters. That's where all the control centers are. Now the security forces

267
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:50,120
 working that night that were on Bentwaters, I think it was about 13 of them seen at land.

268
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:58,960
 Then everybody else that was working our restrict areas on Woodbridge at Charlie and Delta area,

269
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:06,560
 they seen the object in the woods but it was mostly a dome of light that was over the woods

270
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:15,520
 and as far as getting direct contact with the vehicle itself was John and I and Kibansack.

271
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:23,320
 But everybody that was working on Woodbridge base that night and Bentwaters base that night

272
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:34,840
 seen it take off. That was observed by everybody. When it landed, I gather that it was not detailed

273
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:42,880
 enough so there was some concern that it might be a crash of one of our aircraft? Well, when

274
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:51,960
 I approached the craft itself, we were familiar with all types of aircraft and silhouettes.

275
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,840
 We practiced routinely. We could tell by looking at the silhouettes what kind of aircraft they

276
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:05,400
 were Warsaw Pack or if they were Chinese or ours. But the craft itself was void of things

277
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,920
 that aircraft need to fly. I mean, it did not have a crew compartment that I could see,

278
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:18,920
 did not have exhaust, did not have intake. I did not know what the front was. So it was

279
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,440
 pretty void of all those things. And aerodynamically, well, it was a brick. I mean, there's no way

280
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,420
 that thing could fly. And my mindset at the time was that was not going anywhere. It was

281
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,000
 just going to stay there. So I had all the time in the world.

282
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,920
 >> Can I take a second to add to that? The reason why we were sent out there by our shift

283
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:46,760
 commander and after discussion on the phone was the fact that Eastern radar was contacted

284
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:52,080
 and notified us that there was some kind of object over the base that disappeared in the

285
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,960
 forest. Because it was off base, our jurisdiction was limited. But because the possibility existed

286
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,440
 that something actually crashed in the forest, the decision was made by the shift commander

287
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,920
 to allow us to go out into the forest to investigate. At the same time, the local authorities were

288
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,200
 contacted also. >> Was there a radar track before it landed?

289
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,760
 It was picked up on radar before it landed? >> Yes, what we were informed was Eastern radar,

290
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,960
 our local radar, both picked up something on radar over the forest area outside of Woodbridge

291
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,860
 Airport space. >> Okay. What were the approximate dimensions

292
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,160
 of the vehicle? >> Well, I had to pace them off. I took a

293
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,960
 large stride, so I measured it as nine feet by nine feet by nine feet. I'm six foot two,

294
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,780
 so I measured it estimated at six and a half, seven feet tall. We did have berms, earthen

295
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:51,960
 berms that was in the forest, and so the area was uneven somewhat. It was actually a very

296
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,320
 small craft, and that was one of the puzzling parts of it, is it was just too small for

297
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:04,680
 it to be piloted, in my opinion. >> Was there any investigation of the landing

298
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:12,440
 site? Was it cordoned off, and did experts come to see what artifacts might have been

299
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,640
 left there? >> Yes, well, the security forces did, besides

300
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:25,000
 obviously us two, did an investigation the following morning, which included several

301
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,660
 security personnel, and then also about a week later, a little less, Colonel Halt informed

302
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,400
 us that a team from Langley came in, and they cordoned the whole area off on the east end

303
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:46,280
 of adjacent to the east gate where the area was, and they provided their own entry control,

304
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,880
 and they wouldn't allow us in the area. They were there a few days, and then left, packed

305
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,840
 up and left. >> The documentation relative to this, is

306
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:03,320
 it now existing, or has it been lost, destroyed? >> May I take that, please?

307
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,760
 >> Yes, sir. >> Yes, the British government's file on this

308
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,960
 incident has been declassified and released under the UK Freedom of Information Act, and

309
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,960
 you should all have in front of you Colonel Halt's initial memo to the Ministry of Defence,

310
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,660
 which certainly mentions the radiation readings that were taken at the landing site by a number

311
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:32,480
 of people, including the disaster preparedness officer, Monroe Nevels, who did the assessment.

312
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,560
 You should also have in your pack a British government document, again released under

313
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,000
 the Freedom of Information Act in the UK, which is the defence intelligence staff assessment

314
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 of those radiation levels that were reported to us, and you'll see that that document suggests

315
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,800
 that the readings were about seven times higher. >> One more, please. Thank you. Continue.

316
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,200
 >> Those who debunk the whole UFO thing, what do they do with this incident? How do they

317
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:07,360
 explain it away? I mean, it was real, you saw it, it was tracked on radar. How do they

318
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,160
 explain it away? >> We believe the cover-up started within 24

319
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,120
 hours after the incident. There was an individual sat downtown and made contact with some of

320
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,640
 the local, what they call reporters and investigators that were involved in UFOs, and it was spread

321
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:30,240
 around that there was some kind of alien contact in the forest. Also what went on after that

322
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,880
 was there was a debunker that came forward and tried to explain it away as either Colonel

323
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,800
 Halt, who was a combat controller prior to becoming command officer, that he was either

324
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:50,400
 fooled by stars, planets, or the local lighthouse. >> Well, how did they explain the radar track?

325
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,680
 >> It's just like all the other documents that we present. They just try to downplay

326
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,920
 what we have. >> They're not talkable.

327
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,680
 >> They're not talkable. >> Yeah, I've had a very long-time curiosity

328
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:10,180
 and interest in this, and my major concern has been what do you do with those sightings

329
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,220
 that were accompanied by a radar track? You know, you can have searchlights off of clouds

330
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,800
 and they can appear to move very, very rapidly and the eyes can be fooled. But, you know,

331
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:25,860
 when you have both a visual sighting, several people seeing it, and picked up on radar,

332
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:32,000
 you can't just wish that went away. And I'm just curious how they deal with those number

333
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,360
 of incidents that have both visual sightings and a radar track, and in this case, you know,

334
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:44,120
 a landing. And am I to understand that there are few existing records that the records

335
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:52,280
 of this incident, like those of Roswell, are gone? >> Some of the paperwork has survived,

336
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:58,360
 but to answer the specific question about how governments deal with UFOs that are simultaneously

337
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,600
 tracked on radar, in my experience at the Ministry of Defense, the issue is decoupled.

338
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,920
 In other words, the Ministry of Defense will then say, when responding to questions, radar

339
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:21,720
 is not an exact science and anomalous returns can arise through faults or through meteorological

340
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:29,440
 effects. So governments will typically downplay the radar in that way, and then, as I say,

341
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,160
 decouple it from the eyewitness testimony, as if they were two separate issues.

342
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,960
 >> That is true. You can have spurious results. But when that is accompanied by visual sightings,

343
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,560
 doesn't it give that some credibility to the radar track?

344
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:49,840
 >> It does, yes, sir. But that's simply how the Ministry of Defense would downplay that

345
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,360
 issue. >> Officially in Britain, is this handled

346
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,040
 the same way it is in our country, just denial that it exists?

347
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:06,200
 >> The Ministry of Defense UFO project was based very much on the United States Air Force

348
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,200
 program Project Blue Book, right from the terms of reference through to the investigative

349
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:20,600
 methodology. And, yes, very much the conclusion was we accept that people do see strange things

350
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:26,400
 that can't always be explained, but we do not believe these things to be of any defense

351
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,000
 interest or significance. That was the party line.

352
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,480
 >> You know, a few of these, one here and one there, and it's easy to accept that that

353
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,320
 might be just hallucination or something, but when there are so many, so many different

354
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:51,880
 places over so many years, doesn't it become pretty much obligatory that something's, that

355
00:35:51,880 --> 00:36:02,100
 we recognize that something's there? >> I agree. And, indeed, that's one of the

356
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:08,680
 reasons why I continue to speak out on this issue. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Defense's

357
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:15,280
 UFO project was the victim of defense cuts in 2009 and has now gone the same way as the

358
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:22,240
 USAAF program Project Blue Book. >> I think that this attempt to cover up, clearly

359
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:31,120
 there is that attempt to cover up, reflects an attitude on leadership about the general

360
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,600
 public that I have a lot of trouble with, that somehow the general public is not able

361
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,200
 to cope with something like this, that they have to be protected, that they would panic,

362
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,880
 that they're too dumb to understand or something like that. I just don't think that this is

363
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,320
 the way that our general public ought to be viewed. If it's out there, if it's real, we

364
00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:02,680
 have a right to know. And the government, which covers it up, they can cover that up

365
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,720
 and make assumptions about what I ought to know, what I ought not to know. That gives

366
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,400
 me a lot of concern. Thank you very much for your testimony.

367
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,960
 >> Thank you. I note that Sergeant Burroughs, you had something you wanted to add there?

368
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,240
 >> No, ma'am. >> You're fine. Thank you, Congressman. Congresswoman

369
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,320
 Hooley, please. >> All right. Thank you very much. Thank you

370
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,840
 all for being on this panel. And Sergeant Penniston and Sergeant Burroughs, thank you

371
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:35,080
 for hanging in here. This has been a lot of years you've carried this around with you.

372
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,800
 What are you doing now? Not in this minute, in life.

373
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:50,480
 >> Okay. I got that. No, we're in the process of making this a historical document. We're

374
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:58,480
 writing a book, the three of us together to put this out. And I recently, you know, was

375
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,720
 a human resource director for a county government for 20 years. Actually, I've been on the service

376
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:11,240
 and retired now for 20 years this year, so. >> And in your record -- well, Sergeant Burroughs,

377
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,760
 what are you doing now? >> Yes, ma'am. I retired from the Air Force

378
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,640
 in 2006. And I took a couple civilian jobs and also was a basketball coach. But because

379
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:30,560
 of my current medical conditions, I'm basically limited in what I can do and I'm trying to

380
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:37,840
 work on getting disability. >> So your current medical situations, both

381
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:47,240
 of you. So are you getting treated by the Veterans Administration for this -- your illnesses?

382
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:58,480
 >> Barely. Okay. They have addressed a few issues, like with the interior problems of

383
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:06,760
 disbalance issues. See, one of the problems was is initially -- we were supposed to treat

384
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:13,520
 it as top secret, which we did. I followed orders. Then when I did that, I had to go

385
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,920
 to the base of the hospital because I was having problems walking. I mean, it was like

386
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:25,520
 within three weeks after the incident. So here I am with a dilemma. Do I violate orders

387
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,400
 and tell them -- because they asked me and they said, have you been exposed to radiation

388
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:40,120
 recently? So I followed orders and said no. I mean, it was obvious that that was radioactive

389
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:46,960
 out there because it was so warm to touch. >> So you did touch it. That was going to

390
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,360
 be -- >> Yeah, that's probably the worst decision

391
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:59,120
 I made, I think, touching that. Yeah. I didn't -- after the initial contact with it and the

392
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,080
 explosion of light, I didn't touch it again, though. I just walked around it and tried

393
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:14,440
 to write down as many notes as I could. Getting back to the medical issues, I got out in 1993,

394
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:22,360
 and early 1994, I went to -- I was just having a terrible time sleeping. I mean, I was getting

395
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:28,640
 maybe two to three hours a night of sleep, and so I decided to -- I went to my doctor

396
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,280
 and she said, well, maybe I'll send you to a psychiatrist. It could be some PTSD. I didn't

397
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,800
 call it that then, but -- and I said, okay, we'll try that.

398
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,040
 >> And this is a VA doctor? >> No, I had to pay for that myself. They

399
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:47,040
 went -- the VA said I didn't have a medal for combat in England, so I know that makes

400
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,440
 no sense. I said I had an incident -- I told them all about that. I had an incident. I

401
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,240
 said I can't -- it was classified and I can't tell you what it is, but it's fair -- viable

402
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,560
 with the government, not necessarily the Air Force. But anyway, they wouldn't -- I went

403
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,840
 to my own doctor, my own MD, and she referred to me to a -- I told her I wanted a reasonable

404
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,000
 price -- a psychiatrist. I mean, that's impossible. I want you to know that. There's no reasonable

405
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,920
 pricing on that. So I go there, and, you know, after a couple

406
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,040
 of visits, she says, you know what I'd like to do? Because I think she was thinking like,

407
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,120
 oh, maybe you're abused when you're a child or something like that. I don't know. Who

408
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:33,400
 knows? And she said, I'd like to do some hypnosis with you and, you know, transgressional hypnosis

409
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,240
 and we'll try that. She says I'm going to tape it because that's what I use for notes.

410
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,360
 And I said, okay. And so -- and she says you won't remember nothing. I'll make sure that

411
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,040
 you don't remember anything from it. And she said we'll get you to sleep in the morning.

412
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:54,040
 I said great. And then I come out of the hypnosis. It was like two hours. And she's like -- she

413
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:59,920
 looked like I don't -- her mouth is down at the bottom of the table. And she says, tell

414
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,920
 me about RF Woodbridge. And I said, wow. And I said, I think it's classified. I don't know.

415
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,800
 And she says, well, she said, you know, and I remembered when I got out, that was a specific

416
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,080
 question I asked about it being classified. And they come back with some weird answer.

417
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:26,280
 The Pentagon, the information office said that nothing classified happened at Bentwater,

418
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,800
 so therefore nothing is classified for you to worry about, which is so ridiculous of

419
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:40,000
 an answer from the Pentagon. I mean, what they should have said is the incident is classified.

420
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,640
 And then that means I can't talk about it.

421
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,680
 >> But that doesn't -- that wouldn't mean you couldn't be treated because you can talk

422
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,680
 in generalities.

423
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,680
 >> Right.

424
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:56,920
 >> Yes, I have been exposed to radiation. So I did have another question.

425
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,200
 >> Did you want me to answer?

426
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,280
 >> Yeah, I want you -- yes, please, Mr. Burrows.

427
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,600
 >> So for me, shortly after the incident happened, I started not feeling well. At one point,

428
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:14,760
 my gums turned white. A couple, three months later, while home on leave, I became very

429
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,680
 ill and went into the emergency room. Okay. The doctor there listened to my chest and

430
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,480
 came back and says, well, what does the Air Force say about heart murmurs? And I looked

431
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,160
 at him and I says, I don't have a heart murmur. I just shortly joined the Air Force and my

432
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,200
 physical said I had a clean bill of health. And one of the other interesting things to

433
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,320
 know about a heart murmur is you're not allowed to enter the United States Air Force if you

434
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,320
 have a heart murmur.

435
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
 >> Of course not.

436
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:48,520
 >> It's against regulations. So at that point, I wasn't sure how or why I got it. And the

437
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,200
 other question was, later on when I had vision problems was from the doctor down at Wilford

438
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:01,440
 Hall was have you ever been exposed to radiation? Again, I did not relate back at that point

439
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,240
 to the time in the fields at Reynolds Forest. Three years ago, I got really sick one day.

440
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:16,000
 I went into the urgent care thinking I had bronchitis. They put me on an EKG machine

441
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,600
 and they rushed me to the hospital. I was an AFib, congestive heart failure. At that

442
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:27,280
 point, they did a bunch of tests in the hospital. They shocked my heart back into regular rhythm,

443
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,120
 but none of the tests were conclusive on why I would have AFib or congestive heart failure.

444
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:37,120
 I was released, followed up with my civilian doctor, and eventually the insurance company

445
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,120
 blocked any more tests because there was nothing showing why I could have any of those incidents.

446
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,280
 I was a nonsmoker as far as cigarettes. I didn't drink alcohol. Everything was clearing

447
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,880
 my arteries and everything else and my doctor was perplexed. My heart did rebound and I

448
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,680
 went back to normal life. Eight months later, I walked into the emergency room and my heart

449
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:04,320
 rate, my heart fracture rate was down to ten percent. I was the walking dead. They transferred

450
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:09,020
 me immediately down to a heart hospital in Phoenix, Arizona.

451
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,000
 So you're not, but you're not being treated by the VA?

452
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,880
 No, I'll get to that in a minute. I'll get to that, how it's all about. Because of

453
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:23,480
 all this, Mr. Frisco and I started inquiring with the government, the VA and everybody

454
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,600
 else about, because my doctor's requesting my medical records from the military, about

455
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:36,120
 my records. Senator Kyle, who I sent a letter to in December or January of 2010, took my

456
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:44,400
 case. He started looking into it, okay? During the process of his investigation, we received

457
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,380
 a letter, which we have here today, and a phone call from his, from one of his senior

458
00:45:50,380 --> 00:46:00,080
 staffers saying it appears to be that my records are located in a classified VA section, which

459
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,560
 the staffer told me, which is not well known to anybody, to include members of Congress.

460
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,800
 She said we came across this when we were doing an investigation on PTSD and Agent Orange

461
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,580
 and we kept running into things that we couldn't get past, and we discovered this classified

462
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:25,560
 section, okay? My initial request for my VA records were denied. The VA said that because

463
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:31,240
 I had not filed for disability, they would not even release my medical records, which

464
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:38,380
 belonged to me. They would not release my records to my doctor so I could receive treatment,

465
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,020
 because I had not filed for disability and allowed the VA to review it. Senator Kyle

466
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,560
 had me go in, file a disability claim, and bring him that claim. This was in June of

467
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:53,800
 2010. In November of 2010, after not hearing from him, we sent him a letter. His response

468
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,960
 back to us was I was unable to obtain your records. My suggestion is, because I'm retiring,

469
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,960
 is to try to contact Senator McCain and see what he can do for you. Now, I've gone almost

470
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:12,280
 a year without getting any reaction or any kind of care from the Veterans Administration

471
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,240
 because my records are classified. Finally, after a few months, Senator McCain was able

472
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:24,360
 to move up my claim and I was seen by the VA in Prescott, Arizona. When I met with the

473
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,320
 doctor who was reviewing my case, we started discussing my case. She looks at me and she

474
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,000
 says, because I keep referring back to 79, 80, and 81. She looks at me directly in the

475
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:43,360
 face and says, sir, I have no DD form 214 for you from 1979 to 82. It does not show

476
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,480
 you being in the United States Air Force. And supplicantly, I have no records, no medical

477
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,480
 records of you during that time frame. I looked at her and I said, oh, what a surprise. That

478
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,860
 means they're classified. She looked back at me in shock and said, there's some things

479
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:05,420
 we don't have a need to know. There's people above us that handle this.

480
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:12,060
 Thank you. What I was going to say that, and I would like to ask Mr. Polk a question, but

481
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:18,040
 what I was going to say was, have you gone through your congressional offices? Because

482
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:24,600
 I know in my district, we would have turned that into a major case and demanded, you can't

483
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,320
 tell them what the outcome has to be, but you can demand information all the way down

484
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,960
 to why, you know. What was interesting about both. And asking

485
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,600
 for a waiver. What was very interesting about Senator Kyle

486
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,320
 and Senator McCain is they would not comment on anything other than they would attempt

487
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:46,360
 to get the VA to treat us. That was it. Right. But McCain got you that far.

488
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,080
 Well, I'm currently now, I was, yes, interviewed by the VA.

489
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,440
 Okay. And Mr. Penness. I'm not having too good of a success with

490
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,840
 Senator Kirk. Well, push. I mean, you really have to because

491
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,200
 -- Excuse me. I yield to Kyle some additional two minutes.

492
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:12,200
 Oh, thank you. Because they are your advocates to, I mean, it's our responsibility to be

493
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:21,240
 the interference between, and the conduit between our constituents and federal agencies.

494
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,680
 And the idea that you were in the Air Force and they say you weren't, I mean, this is

495
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,360
 not okay. And these, your members of Congress and senators

496
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:40,200
 have to go front for you on this. We're doing this alone.

497
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,200
 I know. But --

498
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:51,480
 We're not getting the help that we need with it. I mean, when Pat, our attorney, I mean,

499
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,900
 we're retired Air Force. There's no doubt about that, I mean.

500
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,720
 But he tried to get my records. And the only records they're going to provide

501
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:06,840
 him is from the time I got out. Yeah, I know. But what I'm hearing is that

502
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:15,040
 those boroughs and probably yourself, Jim, that they are denying you were even in the

503
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,520
 Air Force the first -- when you were in -- I mean, that is -- come on, that's criminal.

504
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,960
 This is the United States of America. So something has to be fixed with that.

505
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:40,160
 I have to ask Nick Pope a question, okay? I want to know why, when the incident happened

506
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:48,320
 in Great Britain and it wasn't even on the American base, why did the Americans become

507
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,240
 the lead in the investigation? This was in Great Britain.

508
00:50:53,240 --> 00:51:01,900
 My assessment of that is that because the incident was regarded as a security incident,

509
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:07,000
 the Americans did have the jurisdiction to go off base.

510
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,120
 It's -- the umbrella piece of legislation, as I understand it, is the NATO status of

511
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:19,480
 forces agreement. And jurisdiction can actually be concurrent

512
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,920
 in a security situation. The U.S. do have the authority to go outside

513
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:30,480
 the wire. But the U.K. have jurisdiction, too.

514
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,520
 But the U.S. took primacy because it was a security event.

515
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,720
 Okay. Thank you. Let me just make a statement here. I've been

516
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,520
 advised by our congressional research service gentleman on the end there that because you

517
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,520
 were so obedient and had such short opening statements, we do have a little leeway time

518
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,620
 here. So I'm going to yield the congresswoman two

519
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:57,640
 more minutes for the attorney here. Thank you. Mr. Fresco, go on.

520
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:06,400
 I just wanted to add that I'm not helping these gentlemen for my career sake, okay?

521
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:15,120
 I'm doing it because they're worthy of an effort being put forth on their behalf.

522
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:20,000
 And as I had said in the opening statement, their case is so compelling.

523
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 There's just no way I could leave it without trying to do something for it.

524
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,160
 I wanted to say, though, I worked for a member of the California delegation in the 1980s,

525
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:37,580
 a legislative assistant there, too. And one of my issue areas was Bureau of Land

526
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,600
 Management. The oddest thing we came across in that office

527
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:47,800
 at the time were nude sunbathers in the deserts of California that I would have to deal with.

528
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:54,000
 Shame, shame. Well, it goes to the next point I want to

529
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,360
 make, which all I would do is call the liaison with BLM and have them send a call out there

530
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:05,160
 and move them on. But it's interesting to watch the reaction

531
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:12,200
 whenever I approach, particularly in this case with John, Senator Kyle's office.

532
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:17,840
 Everybody gets to a point, for lack of a better word, weird at some point when you bring up

533
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,720
 the rendition case. Everybody gets weird at some point.

534
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,440
 And although I understand the senator was retiring, he had had almost a year, or rather

535
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:34,280
 his -- some L.A. in his office did. If that had been me, Congressman Thomas

536
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:40,320
 would have fired me if after a year I had not resolved a constituents problem.

537
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:49,760
 So nothing against Senator Kyle or his staff. But it goes to show how there is a wall at

538
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:57,240
 some point you reach in this case. And thus, we're at the point that we are.

539
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,640
 And searching for answers. Well, I'm hoping that others of my colleagues

540
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,480
 up here are going to continue this conversation, because they've told me I've outwarned my

541
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,280
 welcome for a moment. Very good, very good line of questioning.

542
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,480
 Thank you, Congresswoman. Senator Gravel.

543
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:20,400
 I'll continue to pursue that line of questioning. I get my health services from the V.A., so

544
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:29,160
 I have some hands-on experience with them. Is this the first time you've brought your

545
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:36,400
 case in a public hearing? Or has it all been on direct contact through your attorney or

546
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,600
 through your own efforts with the V.A.? Is this the first time this is being made public?

547
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:47,440
 Yes, sir. What we were trying to do is work within the system, which has failed us so

548
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:54,720
 far, and trying to get some kind of, you know, care and results on what's going on. And like

549
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,400
 Mr. Friscona said, every time we reach a certain point, we get stonewalled. So at this point

550
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,360
 we felt it was time to make it public. Let me just give you a little bit of advice.

551
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:12,320
 You know, God helps those who help themselves. And so you've got to be a lot more aggressive.

552
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:19,320
 When the political system that you interface with, not even got to the V.A. yet, was not

553
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:26,680
 responsive with any immediacy, and this is what Carol, the congresswoman, was referring

554
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:33,480
 to, is that, you know, it's a given on our side, in our activities, that when you have

555
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,600
 a case that just cries out for attention, you just put the muscle on it and you make

556
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:44,440
 sure that there's an intelligent response. And so I'm somewhat horrified to just hear

557
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:51,640
 your story, because, you know, we're dealing with bureaucracies, and bureaucracies are

558
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:57,360
 human beings, and some human beings are responsive, and some are not. And you clearly have run

559
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:03,920
 into a series of bad luck of those who aren't responsive. The classification problem that

560
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,380
 stymies me, that they would classify your records or not acknowledge that you had served,

561
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:15,640
 you have a discharge document, right? Okay. So that proves that you were somewhere for

562
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:24,840
 some period of time. And so I just really want to say that get back on this. You'll

563
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,200
 obviously, there'll be some attention as a product of this hearing, but I think that

564
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:39,120
 you want to get back to your congressional persons and really be aggressive. This is

565
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:46,520
 just unfair. This is just gross incompetence and negligence on the part of the government.

566
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:52,960
 And you're the victims of this. And my wife and I, whenever I go to a doctor or I bring

567
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,680
 my wife along, you need an advocacy. You need somebody to stick on top of the issues, not

568
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:05,520
 just because you're somewhat in a bad situation when you're in front of a doctor, you're just

569
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,520
 giving them the information. Sometimes they're competent, sometimes they don't care. I had

570
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:20,840
 a doctor in the VA and she told me I really wasn't ill. I was wasting her time. There's

571
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:26,560
 more important people to see that are ill. Well, I made a complaint right to the top

572
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:33,360
 at that VA hospital and I want a new doctor, period. And the new doctor I got was a sympathetic,

573
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:40,520
 caring person and helped me a great deal. So you've got to take that responsibility

574
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:48,480
 on yourselves. And that's the best advice I can give you is be aggressive. Don't put

575
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:55,640
 up with this crap from a bureaucracy that's unresponsive and whether it's a congressional

576
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:01,480
 area that's unresponsive or the VA that's unresponsive, you know, here again, squeaky

577
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:07,020
 wheel gets the grease. And so you've just got to do that. And you've got to take somebody

578
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:12,360
 with you to act as an advocate during an examination because you can't remember everything that

579
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:19,920
 they're saying to you. Let me ask, can you share with us a little bit more, first Jim

580
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:27,000
 and yourself, the physical problem that you're experiencing? Well, like I said earlier, it

581
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,160
 started out with the inner ear problem. Eventually... Which affects your balance. Right. But you

582
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,560
 know, if you do, if you're in that, have that condition long enough, you end up compensating

583
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:47,600
 quite a bit, you can do those things. They eventually did say it was Meniere's disease

584
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:54,120
 on separation, when they did do that. And I can get treated for that, which I do get

585
00:58:54,120 --> 00:59:03,440
 medicine for that. But approximately two years after the incident, I mean, I got violently

586
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,760
 sick and I got put in the hospital and apparently I had my heart infection and it was heart

587
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:15,160
 related and I've never had anything like that before. And I almost died. It was a touch

588
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:22,040
 and go situation. And anyway, I pulled through it and I like to have those records. Why would

589
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:29,160
 that happen? And everything they come up with, they always ask... Are these records VA now

590
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:34,400
 or private records? Well, these are US Air Force. Okay. When I was in... During, when

591
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:43,080
 you were in service? Sure. Or active duty. Yes. In your VA records right now, is it on

592
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:49,680
 a computer? In other words, are you in the system at this point? Yes, I'm in the system

593
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,640
 for the Meniere's part. The other stuff, they won't treat it. But everything should be in

594
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:00,080
 the computer. In other words, it's a history and the Congress has appropriated a lot of

595
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:06,360
 money to get this down. If the gentleman will yield to me one minute. I sure will. It's

596
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:13,240
 my understanding that they started from a certain point and went forward. They have

597
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:19,680
 these guys' records in a box somewhere or in a file cabinet or something. And they intend

598
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:27,920
 to bring it all up to date. But I would guess that they're not for back then when they don't

599
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,360
 even acknowledge they were in the Air Force, that it's in the computer. How old are you?

600
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:40,560
 I'm 58. Okay. So, I'm old enough that I bounce one from the other. If I'm not happy, I'll

601
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:48,920
 go to Medicare or VA, preferably VA. And your age? 52, sir. Okay. You both got a little

602
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:57,640
 bit of time to wait. But in your case, there's no record at all of you in the VA system?

603
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,840
 Okay. Two things happened with Senator Kyle. Number one, when he initially requested my

604
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:08,360
 records, they didn't exist. They weren't where they were supposed to be. And after a second

605
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:15,960
 letter was sent, and it was interesting the way the St. Louis treated him, they told him

606
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,720
 they'd try to look into it for him. They said, "We'll try to locate his records, but they're

607
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,560
 not where they belong." Eventually, they were able to get part of my personnel records released.

608
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:36,920
 Okay? And then from the personnel records, my DD form 214 is missing from 79 to 82. When

609
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,840
 I went in and saw the doctor, she was the one that brought up to me that there was no

610
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:46,200
 medical records in her file that she had received for me from 79 to 82. And she looked at me

611
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,720
 funny and said, "There's no record of you being in the Air Force from 79 to 82." And

612
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,600
 I pulled out a piece of paper that I brought with me showing where I came in the Air Force

613
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:01,160
 enlisted in 1979. And I also showed her the physical showing that I came in with no heart

614
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:06,400
 problems, and my exit physical with heart problems. And that changed her attitude towards

615
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,640
 me at that point. And again, like I said, she looked at me and said, "There's some things

616
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,160
 that we don't have need to know." And I said to her, I says, "Well, how are you going to

617
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,320
 do a fair evaluation on my case? Because you're the one that's going to recommend whether

618
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,160
 I receive disability and what kind of treatment I get. Am I correct?" And she said, "Yes,

619
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,360
 sir." And she says, "Well, sir, what I can tell you is there might be somebody above

620
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,600
 me that'll have to look into this incident at this point."

621
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,760
 Well, yeah, that's sort of pattern. I hate to admit this as a former senator, but my

622
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:40,920
 experience generally has been that you get better casework from the House member than

623
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:46,640
 you do from the senator. And I hate to admit that, but that's a fact.

624
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,640
 Can I bring up a point?

625
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:54,760
 Sir, can I bring up a point though? The reason why we contacted Senator Kyle was his vast

626
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:01,120
 experience in helping veterans. He had a vast staff in Phoenix, then we did our research

627
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:06,080
 that their job, and they were very successful at helping veterans solve their cases.

628
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,200
 Were they successful helping you?

629
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,440
 No, sir, they weren't. And she was very frustrated.

630
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,120
 That's my case right there.

631
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:16,120
 Right. She was very frustrated with me. When I met face to face with her, she told me,

632
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,960
 "You're probably never going to know what happened to you, but hopefully we can at least

633
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,920
 get you some care." That's what the aide told me.

634
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,760
 They've got to learn what happened to you, because you can't go to a doctor and have

635
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:33,280
 a mystery or have a void, because they can't practice medicine that way. I'm fascinated

636
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:41,520
 by one thing. I'd like to move away from the VA. And again, let me, it's your responsibility

637
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:47,800
 to be aggressive and not take no for an answer. You've served, you paid your dues, and you're

638
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:55,720
 entitled to be taken care of by the country that you've served. So if you're not getting

639
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:02,400
 satisfaction here, go there, but be aggressive. The thing that I'm fascinated by, now, you

640
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,160
 did not touch the craft. He touched the craft, right?

641
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,640
 No, sir, I did not touch the craft.

642
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:13,240
 Okay. Now, I want you to walk us through. You're walking up to it, and you touch it.

643
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,280
 What do you do? Touch it, that? Do you grab it? Tell us about that.

644
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:23,920
 Okay. Well, after the explosion of light, and we did hit the ground, I mean, I thought

645
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,440
 it was going to explode.

646
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,440
 That's good training.

647
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,440
 Yeah.

648
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:33,720
 I mean, it was reaction. So there was no noise. So I got up and compiled myself, just composed

649
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:42,880
 myself just a little bit, and I said, "Well, I got to do what I'm supposed to do. I need

650
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:48,120
 to investigate and get as much information as I can and report it back to some of the

651
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:56,680
 higher pay grade, you know, who can make a decision on this." I felt since there was

652
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:04,880
 no reaction from it at the beginning, it was non-hostile. I mean, it didn't look like it

653
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,080
 was going to go anywhere. It looked like it was fixed. It was going to stay there. So

654
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:17,520
 I started doing the walk around 360 of the object, and as I came around, I seen there

655
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:23,400
 was an inscription on the front, and I was actually relieved. I thought it was going

656
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:32,320
 to say United States Air Force, Nassau, some product. I was looking for that. And when

657
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:39,320
 I seen the glyphs, I, you know, your imagination does, when I went into that forest, I never

658
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:44,720
 believed in UFOs, ET alien, and I still don't, by the way.

659
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,720
 This is what you saw, right?

660
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:52,760
 That's what I saw. So, you know, I'm having a hard time rationalizing this because I really

661
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,240
 wanted it to be an aircraft crash, too. I mean, there's all kinds of things I wanted

662
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,640
 it to be because it didn't look like an aircraft crash. I was just trying to make it an aircraft

663
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:07,320
 crash because we lost contact, you know, prior to 15 minutes. I said, "It gave us permission

664
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:12,880
 to go off." So I started walking around the craft, and I seen the glyphs, and as I, you

665
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,400
 know, ran my hand from the fabric of the craft, it was smooth to touch.

666
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,160
 You ran your hands along it?

667
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,600
 Yeah, I started feeling it, and I said, "Well, the first thing I looked at was underneath

668
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,600
 it," because I said, "How's this being fixed?"

669
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:32,040
 Excuse me for a moment for the record. I yield to you in an additional couple of minutes.

670
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,920
 Thank you. I'll take whatever I can get.

671
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,920
 You know, I was wondering how...

672
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,920
 Just to conclude it.

673
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:43,800
 I was wondering how, sir, it was being, how it was sitting there in the forest. So there

674
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:48,560
 was light emulating underneath it. So as I looked down, there was no landing here, but

675
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:57,920
 it was up, off the ground, maybe two feet. So here I am, pushing the craft. It doesn't

676
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,640
 move. Nothing. As solid as can be. So I said, "Okay." So I start running my hand across it.

677
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,960
 Was it humming when you tried to...

678
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:11,920
 There was complete silence. There was, the air temperature at that time was about 32

679
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,400
 degrees. When I touched the craft, it felt like metal, smooth metal, and I would say,

680
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,240
 and this is an estimate, guess...

681
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,800
 Did you have gloves on, or was it your own skin?

682
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:30,360
 No, it was my own skin. Anyway, I figured the temperature of it might have been 45,

683
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:38,800
 50 degrees. Unbeknownst to me, it probably was radioactive, and that's probably why it

684
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:48,480
 was warm. I didn't realize that at the time. Then as I walked around it, I knew it was

685
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:56,320
 nothing that we had, and it surely wasn't nothing the Russians had. No, it was beyond

686
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,320
 our technology.

687
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:03,320
 Thank you very much. All I wanted to do is leave one, two words with you. Question authority.

688
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,320
 Just don't take...

689
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,320
 Thank you.

690
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:09,000
 Question authority.

691
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,160
 In the sergeant's defense, in the military, you just do what you're told, and you do your

692
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:18,840
 job. All you all know that. You're a senator, so that makes a difference. You get a little

693
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,520
 bit more out of that, but no, your point...

694
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,520
 We don't know until...

695
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,040
 I know. I know. We do have to do that, particularly in today's world, for sure.

696
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,480
 I walk in, and I get good care as a human being. They don't know that.

697
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:36,040
 No, I don't believe that. Yeah, okay. Excuse me. Congresswoman Hooley.

698
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:43,680
 Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for taking your time to testify. I found it fascinating.

699
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:51,720
 When this aircraft landed, how long did it take for the public to find out that this

700
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:57,840
 object, this aircraft, this thing had landed?

701
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:04,800
 Some local people were aware of this incident almost immediately, and indeed, there are

702
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:10,240
 a number of civilian witnesses who have gone on the record with that. The document that

703
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:15,880
 you'll have from the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Holt, was made

704
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:23,480
 public in 1983, but for many years, this was the only piece of paper that had been released

705
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,200
 in that way. But it was 1983 that it went public.

706
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:37,600
 And why was there... So it went public, but before that, was there any... Did they try

707
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:46,400
 to cover up that this thing had landed? Yes. My understanding is that a number of

708
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:52,880
 local reporters, and indeed, a number of local investigators of strange phenomena, were aware

709
01:09:52,880 --> 01:10:01,440
 that something had happened, questioned aggressively the great base press office, were told that

710
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:07,380
 nothing had occurred. And it was only when this document was released under the Freedom

711
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:12,960
 of Information Act that the authorities were forced to say, "Oh, yes, we did have an incident."

712
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:19,240
 But even then, it was downplayed. Okay. Were there other members of the military

713
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,600
 that were out there walking around the craft like you were?

714
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:31,680
 No, ma'am. I was the only one that walked around a craft. John was incapacitated at

715
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:40,880
 the time, so by whatever visual lighting that was causing him to be enveloped in it, he

716
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,800
 just recently came public with that. And I've known about that for years, but this is a

717
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:54,160
 human journey we're going through also, to be able to deal with certain emotional issues

718
01:10:54,160 --> 01:11:00,640
 with it. And so John just went public with that. But that's one of the things I kept

719
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:06,600
 secret until he was ready, what was happening to him. And the poor guy, one night wasn't

720
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,880
 enough, he did it on two nights. Same thing happened to him. So it's very disturbing,

721
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:17,760
 actually, for me to even think that would happen to somebody. You know, I was helpless.

722
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:24,480
 I did what I had to do. I figured I was going to die out there that night. So I figured

723
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:34,920
 I was going to get as much information, do my job. And well, we're here. So I was wrong.

724
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:40,800
 Were you the only two out there? No. Okay. On the first night. This actual incident took

725
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,280
 place over three nights. Okay. Three nights. Okay. And if you look at the halt memo, you'll

726
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,840
 see that the date is wrong on the first night when it started. That was one of the things

727
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,080
 that we've questioned and we were able to prove eventually that the initial date that

728
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,940
 he put down was not wrong, was not correct. But the first night was our incident. The

729
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:05,160
 second night, there was a small incident where they observed lights again in the forest moving

730
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:10,960
 around and they sent two personnel out to investigate. One of them is the on-duty shift

731
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:17,040
 commander. At one point, a beam of light shot down at their vehicle, threw it, and shut

732
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:23,880
 the vehicle off. At that point, she was so upset she was relieved of duty and sent home

733
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,960
 for the rest of the night. On the third night, which is the Colonel Halt incident, which

734
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,920
 he describes in the memo, there were several areas of reported, you know, incidents that

735
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:40,320
 went on. But one of the most interesting parts is he recorded a tape. I believe it's about

736
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:47,320
 what, 13 minutes long, Nick? Was it 13? 17 minutes long of real-time what was going on.

737
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,320
 If you get a chance to listen to the tape, at one point you're going to hear him. Now

738
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:57,240
 whatever it is is coming at us from the south. There's a beam of light shining down on our

739
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:03,200
 feet. This is unreal. And you should hear the emotion in his voice. And this is a front-line

740
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:09,440
 officer that was a combat controller at one point. And you can clearly hear the concern

741
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:17,000
 in his voice. So there was several other incidents that took place also besides ours.

742
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:25,840
 So how many people actually saw this? Did anybody, I mean, I would think you were in

743
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:34,960
 a base or near a base, right? We were probably 300 yards from Woodbridge, working that night

744
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:42,200
 at Woodbridge and in Bentwaters. I know he said 40. That's probably the security flight

745
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:48,640
 with LA. It might have ran up to 60, maybe. I don't know, a little less. Of course, we

746
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:54,600
 also had, you know, like fire department and those folks. There was other people that seen

747
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:02,720
 this on night one. Right. And then, of course, there was the civilian numbers that we found

748
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:08,680
 out later on. We didn't realize how many there were. We thought it was pretty isolated as

749
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:16,080
 far as anybody seeing it. But we were wrong about that too. Yeah, I would have thought

750
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:21,120
 that someone would have probably come out and recorded it and looked at it and taken

751
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:29,040
 some of it. Did any other people, do you know, touch it? No, I was the only one out there

752
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:39,200
 that made physical contact. It's a hard question for me because John received contact too,

753
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:46,160
 but it wasn't, I don't believe, with a physical object. It was, he was engulfed in a beam

754
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:54,200
 of light out there. It also happened on the third night. I don't know why with him. That's

755
01:14:54,200 --> 01:15:00,040
 even more fascinating why it would even happen twice. I mean, that's the unusual part of

756
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:05,720
 this. I mean, here you got a landing of craft of unknown origin. That's what I put in my

757
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:13,320
 report because I'm in the Air Force and that's what we do. We don't use those other words.

758
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:20,040
 And then on the, what, two days later, it's back and the base commander, the deputy base

759
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:27,000
 commander is going to put this to bed. He's going to debunk it. And his life changed too.

760
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:34,280
 So that's the way it came down and the way it worked. And all we want is, okay, an incident

761
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,280
 happened and we just want to be taken care of over it. And there's a lot of other veterans

762
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:45,100
 that were working that night. We also have access to about 240 of the other security

763
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:51,320
 policemen that were stationed at that twin bases there. And some of them have similar

764
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:57,800
 problems too. And we would, we'd like to, you know, we're working for them too, not

765
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:02,120
 just ourselves. So. >> Have you reconnected with some of the people

766
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:08,920
 that were there that night? >> Right. And I want you to know that the,

767
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,920
 I want to add this in. I know this wasn't a question, ma'am, but I want you to know

768
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:19,760
 that the wing commander, the base commander, those folks when we went in and gave them

769
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,520
 a sanitized version of what happened, because we were instructed to give them a sanitized

770
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:33,360
 version from OSI. They never asked one question, the wing commander. It's like he knew everything

771
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:43,100
 was going on out there. And we found documents recently that show why he reacted that way.

772
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:49,080
 So what should have happened if there was any doubt on our credibility or any doubt

773
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:54,720
 on our mental state, any doubt, any activity at all, I'm not sure if you're familiar with

774
01:16:54,720 --> 01:17:01,720
 the Air Force personal reliability program, PRP. That's when each, all of us had the responsibility

775
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:07,320
 to look at the other person they're working with and say, well, he's acting odd or something

776
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,880
 strange or some odd behavior. You're supposed to report it immediately.

777
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:17,800
 What should have happened if there was any suspicion at all that we were not being completely

778
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:24,200
 honest or with the command element, they should have relieved us of duty for 30 days, had

779
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:32,360
 a medical evaluation, and then at 30-day mark, decide whether or not they're going to permanently

780
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:39,880
 decertify us under PRP or return us to duty. None of that happened. It's because we went

781
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:44,640
 out and reported what we'd seen. They believed everything we said. And then to reinforce

782
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:51,280
 it three nights later, Colonel Halt and his team go out. And when Colonel Halt called

783
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:57,380
 us in the office a few days later, like five days later after the first night, I was so

784
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:02,640
 happy to hear him say that he had an experience out there and he was backing up what I was

785
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:07,920
 saying from the first night. I said, good, it's off my shoulders. I got a soon-to-be

786
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,680
 full colonel taking responsibility, saying, OK, I'll take the fight from this point on.

787
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:17,200
 And he did, actually.

788
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:28,440
 In trying to get help through the military, has he collaborated? I mean, has he been there

789
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,440
 for you?

790
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:37,160
 Yes. The end result is what we looked at. And he has done up a letter that said that

791
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:42,160
 we were out there at a certain time and what happened. And we encountered a craft on an

792
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:51,920
 origin. He eludes to that. And he says that we were probably exposed to radiation. And

793
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:57,380
 this letter he did for us to go to the VA. So we are being aggressive with it that way.

794
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:00,200
 I have no problem being aggressive.

795
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,120
 Good. You need to be aggressive.

796
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,120
 I'm a retired sergeant. I have no problem doing that.

797
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,120
 Thank you.

798
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,240
 Can I bring up a point, ma'am?

799
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,240
 Yes, please.

800
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:17,680
 All right. You told us to be aggressive. Where was our chain of command when it came for

801
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:23,000
 them to be aggressive? After the incident happened, we were brought in and interrogated.

802
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,600
 They did nothing to stop that. They did nothing to step up and make sure that we were treated

803
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,920
 medically after the incident. OK, the chain of command is clearly partly, or at least

804
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:41,600
 partly, being prohibited and what they need to do because this incident has been classified.

805
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,500
 And not only has it been classified, it's been classified and kept away from the people

806
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,880
 that serve this country, which is the Senate and House of Representatives, the United States

807
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:58,360
 of America. And we're trying to do what we're trying to do, but at the same time, where

808
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:04,280
 are we going to go when people like Senator Kyle are prohibited from receiving records?

809
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:09,360
 Yeah. I was going to say . . .

810
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,360
 He . . .

811
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:15,840
 Go to a House member.

812
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:23,240
 Yeah. You have to . . . I tell this to . . . when I was in Congress, I told this to every person

813
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,680
 that came in that wanted anything or wanted any help.

814
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:29,160
 Excuse me. I yield the Congress home additional two minutes.

815
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:38,800
 All right. You also have to be very persistent with that member that you're dealing with,

816
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,600
 whether it's a Senator or a House member. You have to be persistent and say, "What have

817
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:48,880
 you found out? Is anything happening?" And talk to . . . I mean, if they've . . . most

818
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:54,000
 members have really great staff, talk to the staff and you just have to be just pound on

819
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:04,080
 them that you need to have this information. But I so appreciate you telling us this story.

820
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:11,760
 It's . . . I am embarrassed for our military that they don't come forward with the information

821
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,520
 so that you can get the kind of treatment that you need. So thank you, first of all,

822
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:23,920
 for serving. Again, I hope that there will be people that will step forward. You have

823
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:30,360
 to be consistent, be persistent, and hopefully you'll get the information you need. Thank

824
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,360
 you.

825
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,360
 Thank you, Congresswoman.

826
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,360
 I yield back.

827
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,400
 Thank you, Congresswoman. Congressman Cook?

828
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:44,960
 Yes. You know, I want to say that for any open-minded Americans out there, no matter

829
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:52,040
 how skeptical, this is very interesting stuff we're hearing today. Extremely interesting.

830
01:21:52,040 --> 01:22:00,800
 And I'm surprised that not more Americans know about this Reynolds and Forrest incident.

831
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,920
 I'd like to ask . . . and I want to commend both sergeants for their service to our country

832
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:12,960
 and apologize for the United States government, even though I'm not in any official capacity

833
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:20,400
 at the moment for withholding important information. But let me start, Sergeant Burroughs, by asking

834
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:28,680
 you, you enlisted in the Air Force when you were . . . or in the year 1979, I think you

835
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,680
 said.

836
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,680
 Yes, sir, 1979.

837
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,760
 Okay. And how old were you at the time?

838
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,040
 I would have been 18 years old.

839
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:42,160
 Okay. And how old were you when you were made sergeant in the United States Air Force?

840
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:48,880
 I believe I was . . . I was 22 or 23 when I received my E-Force status. I can't remember

841
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:49,880
 exactly.

842
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,800
 Okay. So that would have been about 1982, '83?

843
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,920
 '82 or '83, if I'm correct.

844
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,760
 Okay. After the Reynolds and Forrest incident?

845
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,760
 Yes, sir.

846
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:09,840
 Okay. And I know that Nick Pope has indicated . . . or no, excuse me, Mr. Franscona, your

847
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:17,080
 attorney has indicated that the very first siding was with Sergeant Stephens and yourself.

848
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:21,960
 Yes, sir. Sergeant Stephens and I were on routine law enforcement patrol. We were down

849
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,920
 checking East Gate and we observed what was going on in the force.

850
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:30,040
 Okay. And Sergeant Stephens went to Sergeant Penniston. Am I right on that?

851
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,680
 Well, what happened was after we called it in, because he was a senior ranking individual,

852
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:40,160
 and Sergeant Penniston responded down to the gate, Sergeant Stephens briefed Sergeant Penniston

853
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,160
 on what was going on.

854
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:50,000
 Oh, I see. Okay. And you went back . . . after Sergeant Penniston wanted to investigate after

855
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,200
 what he had heard, you accompanied him?

856
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:59,880
 Yes. A decision was made by the on-duty shift commander after consultation with the squadron

857
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:05,120
 squad commander that we would go out and investigate, and Sergeant Penniston formed a team.

858
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:10,920
 And what happened to Sergeant Stephens that night?

859
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,400
 Sergeant Stephens was visibly shaken by what he was seeing in the forest, and there was

860
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:20,840
 two reasons why he didn't go out there. Number one, if he would have went out there also,

861
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:21,840
 there would have been nobody . . .

862
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:22,840
 Well, he needed somebody on patrol, right?

863
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:27,520
 Yeah, not only on patrol, but somebody in charge, because he was a senior ranking security

864
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,760
 officer, and Sergeant Stephens was a senior ranking law enforcement. But also, he really

865
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:35,760
 didn't want anything to do with it. Whatever he saw, what he was observing shook him up

866
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,320
 enough that he wanted to stay back, and he did not want to go into the forest.

867
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,880
 And is he still alive? Do you know . . .

868
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:48,880
 We've had trouble tracking down some individuals, but I do believe he is still currently alive.

869
01:24:48,880 --> 01:25:01,240
 I'm particularly interested in this classified record system of the Veterans Affairs Administration,

870
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:08,160
 because I can tell you, our staff, during my tenure in the Congress, spent a great deal

871
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:15,780
 of time with the Veterans Affairs Administration, and I have never heard of a classified section

872
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:22,520
 within Veterans Affairs. Could you tell me, as much as you know, in that short period

873
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,280
 of time here, in about one minute . . .

874
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,280
 Yes, sir.

875
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:31,040
 What is a classified record section, and how many classified records do you believe are

876
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:37,160
 in there after your experience in dealing with them?

877
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:41,640
 Okay. What was summarized, not only in the letter from Senator Cowell's office, which

878
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:47,040
 says once your claim is being processed and is determined that needed records are classified,

879
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:53,960
 the request for those records can be made. What the staffer told me was that the VA has

880
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:58,520
 a section that they maintain records for certain operations, and didn't necessarily mean rentals

881
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:04,080
 from any type of military operations as classified, and it's up to the gaining command, Army,

882
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:08,160
 Air Force, or whatever, whether or not they will allow those records to be released to

883
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:14,000
 the VA so you can receive treatment. She said she came across this recently in the past

884
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,200
 two or three years when she was the same way, was being stymied on certain cases involving

885
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:25,440
 PTSD and Agent Orange, and that she made this available to us. Not only that, but the VA

886
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:29,840
 volunteered it again to her, saying that they would not even let her know if my records

887
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,480
 were classified or not until I filed a disability claim.

888
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:39,560
 In this question, I have no way in excusing a classified records section, especially with

889
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:45,040
 regards to medical records. I can't understand that when, as you say very correctly, Sergeant

890
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:51,600
 Burroughs, you are the owner of those medical records under the law of the United States.

891
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,400
 Even military laws, I understand it, and I'm not an expert on that, but that's the way

892
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:03,360
 I understand it. But as you found out about classified records sections, it's not just

893
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:10,720
 for people that have said, I mean people that are in classified sections aren't just for

894
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:18,760
 members of the, the veterans that have maybe made statements, as you've made, about things

895
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:23,680
 you've seen that relate to an identified flying object. Am I correct?

896
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:28,520
 >> That is correct. Yes, that is correct, sir. She said she became aware of it because

897
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:33,200
 of her work through Senator, you know, with Senator Kyle for veterans and their assistance,

898
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:38,560
 and she specifically said it was for PTSD and Agent Orange that they came across this.

899
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,160
 And she also told me that very few members of Congress were aware of this.

900
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:48,320
 >> I'd like to hear from Sergeant Penniston on this question. If those records were handed

901
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:53,840
 to you today, what do you think would be on those records? Again, these would be records

902
01:27:53,840 --> 01:28:01,120
 from the period, what, '80, December of 1980 to say '82 or '83, or whenever you had those

903
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,920
 medical evaluations while you were in the Air Force.

904
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:12,520
 >> Yeah, there would be a paper trail of my increasing medical condition from the night

905
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:23,480
 of the incident, and it showed progressive issues, and that's what it would show. The

906
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:29,880
 opportunity that we would have this time is that we will actually say that we were exposed

907
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:35,960
 to radiation, and I think that would change how the doctors would look at that.

908
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:40,520
 >> You believe that the records would absolutely show that you've been exposed to the radiation?

909
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:48,120
 >> Well, the conditions that were, that I explained to the doctors at the time, I think

910
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:53,800
 will verify that. But I think Colonel Hall has also done that by issuing that letter

911
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,720
 to the VA. Yeah, I think that's what.

912
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,880
 >> Anything else that might be on those medical records, would your heart condition that you

913
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,360
 talked about show up there?

914
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:08,960
 >> There would be showing treatment for vision problems, which were related to my heart,

915
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:15,120
 and he had no, he could not figure out why I was having the vision problems I have. This

916
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,720
 was a full-blown specialist down at Wilford Hall where they ended up sending me, and he

917
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,760
 did look at me at one point and say, "Were you ever exposed to radiation?"

918
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:28,320
 >> Yeah, and you had, you were a pretty young man, that's kind of unusual at that age, especially

919
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:34,160
 you passed your physical exams to get enlisted into the Air Force, I take it. That's a pretty

920
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:38,680
 young age to be having heart difficulties, but you do believe those records would show

921
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,480
 that. I take your answer was yes.

922
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:44,720
 >> Yes, sir. The records was clearly established that I came in healthy, and shortly after

923
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:48,040
 the incident, I became ill.

924
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:56,560
 >> For either one of you, sergeants, what has been the CIA reaction to your FOIA requests?

925
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,920
 >> Do you want to hear from us, or turn it over directly?

926
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,960
 >> Well, maybe we ought to hear from a lawyer, if you know, or whoever can answer that the

927
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:02,960
 best.

928
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,560
 >> Well, to answer that question, frustrating is the first word that, and the one I've already

929
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,880
 used in regard to them.

930
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,160
 >> But what was their reaction? I understand yours.

931
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:19,880
 >> Theirs was the typical, what they term, the Glomar, from the Glomar Challenger, responds,

932
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:25,520
 which is they can neither confirm nor deny whether they know anything, basically.

933
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,680
 >> And is that, do they know something, the CIA? I mean-

934
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,680
 >> Well, they won't confirm or deny that.

935
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:34,440
 >> Yeah, but I mean, I'm talking about your, and I'm only, I'm not talking about the incident,

936
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,560
 I'm talking about the medical records here.

937
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:43,960
 >> Oh, well, no, the requests propounded to them included medical records, or any and

938
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:49,920
 all records, I really should say. So they don't tell you what they do or don't have

939
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:56,600
 in regards to anything. And whether they actually have something or not, who knows? I mean,

940
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:02,880
 but I have to believe, based also on the boots that were on the ground, that there were the

941
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:03,880
 people there.

942
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:09,840
 >> Okay, now, do either of the sergeants have any other feeling about the CIA, or not about

943
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,840
 the CIA?

944
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,240
 >> About the State Department, we can bring up.

945
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:17,000
 >> I'd love to hear what you think about the State Department's reaction. Again, not to

946
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,200
 the sightings or anything, but to the medical records.

947
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:26,840
 >> Okay. When the State Department was given a FOIA request, they admitted to having records

948
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,840
 on file.

949
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,840
 >> The State Department has admitted?

950
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,840
 >> Yes, they did.

951
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,840
 >> Which would make it an-

952
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,040
 >> The State Department and the CIA is-

953
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,100
 >> Yes, but that would mean it was an international incident, because Department of State was

954
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:42,520
 involved in a foreign country. But what they did then was say that they belonged to United

955
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,760
 States Air Force, and it was up to the Air Force to decide whether or not they would

956
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:51,560
 be released. The United States Air Force claims there's no records on file.

957
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:58,560
 >> Okay. And besides the two Arizona senators that have been talked about, McCain and Kyle,

958
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:06,320
 I'd like to ask you about Senator James Exon, who was a member of the Senate Armed Services

959
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:14,080
 Committee. I understand he said that he had spent more time looking into this particular

960
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:21,320
 incident than any other case in his quote. I think I've got this right. Since I've been

961
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:31,560
 a U.S. Senator, while he's said that additional information like a seven interagency memorandum

962
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:40,880
 is on file, he says that he feels there's been no cover-up. Now, why did he say that?

963
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:44,760
 In your opinions, or the opinion of the attorney, or anybody else that-

964
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:50,060
 >> Well, in my opinion, the Air Force, after the incident broke, the memo was released,

965
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:54,840
 they contacted us and wanted us to have brief contact with the press admitting what happened.

966
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:58,480
 There was something that happened out there, but they didn't want us to go into detail.

967
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:03,800
 And with the MOD saying no defense significance, and the Air Force saying there's no cover-up,

968
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:08,760
 what they're basically saying is an incident took place, and we're not lying that it took

969
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:15,080
 place. But what we're not available and willing to do is go into what's been classified and

970
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:22,200
 what the final outcome was. >> Well, I'd have to say that if they admit

971
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:27,000
 that an incident's taken place without identifying what that incident-

972
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,080
 >> Excuse me, Congressman. Let me yield you an additional two minutes on the record, please.

973
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:39,320
 >> Well, I appreciate that, Chair. It seems to me, and I think, and I hope I'm a fair-minded

974
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:44,800
 person, but I'd like to say any other fair-minded person, that if they've admitted that an incident

975
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:52,080
 has taken place, we don't have to get them to admit maybe your interpretation of what

976
01:33:52,080 --> 01:34:00,720
 you saw, or what you, they don't have to admit what you saw. But they sure have to admit

977
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,740
 that there's no reason to hold your medical records, and this is very disturbing to me,

978
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:11,160
 because the only, what could possibly be a reason to withhold from the person whose medical

979
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:18,800
 record it is, a medical record, if they've confirmed the incident, which they have. Would

980
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:28,040
 you, that's why I'm not necessarily agreeing with Senator Exxon here, and saying, I don't

981
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:35,960
 see how this can be unless a cover-up has taken place. And I don't mean to be throwing

982
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:43,020
 uninformed statements out here, but you cannot admit that there was an incident. I'd just

983
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:47,920
 like to clarify this point once more, because I want to be careful the way I'm saying it.

984
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:54,880
 And then insist on classifying a medical record related to that incident, and it doesn't matter

985
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,800
 what the incident absolutely is or was, and we don't even have to talk about whether it

986
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:06,960
 was a UFO, whether it was, as you say, Sergeant Penniston, you're not totally a believer in

987
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:18,520
 ET, but you believe that you saw definitely an unidentified maneuvering object. Well,

988
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:25,440
 that is solid evidence then. And I'm not saying exactly what you saw is right now, but I'm

989
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:30,200
 saying that is evidence that's indisputed as far as being a cover-up.

990
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:37,720
 Excuse me. Thank you. Eel back, Congressman. Thank you. I have a request from one of our

991
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:41,240
 members who would like a second shot at this, and we'd like to give him the time allotted.

992
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,240
 Congressman.

993
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:48,360
 Thank you very much. I have some questions about the radiation. I understand that the

994
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:56,760
 next day or so they went in and found radiation. If you irradiate food to preserve it, if you

995
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:02,260
 then take the food away from the radiation source, there is no radiation coming from

996
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:08,560
 the food. If there was radiation found at that site the next day or so, something was

997
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:14,800
 left there from which the radiation was coming. Radiation is like light beams. It's gone when

998
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,880
 you pull the source away. The radiation is gone. What was left there?

999
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:23,200
 Nick, go ahead.

1000
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:32,160
 Yes. Colonel Holt investigated the landing site from the first night shortly before he

1001
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:39,800
 had his own encounter, and the disaster preparedness officer, Sergeant Monroe Nevels, noticed that

1002
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:45,480
 not only were there indentations in the ground where this thing had apparently landed, three

1003
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:52,120
 indentations forming essentially a triangular shape, but the inside, this was in a clearing,

1004
01:36:52,120 --> 01:37:02,120
 the insides of the trees seemed to him to have been scorched and burned somewhat. Again,

1005
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:08,800
 the document, the February 23rd Ministry of Defense document that you have is from the

1006
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:15,000
 scientific and technical intelligence part of the defense intelligence staff. I'm not

1007
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,920
 a scientist myself, so I can't speak to the technicalities of it, but clearly a number

1008
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:29,440
 of people who looked at the landing site after Jim and John's account certainly got close

1009
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:34,160
 to all this. This is again one of the reasons why this is of some concern. A number of these

1010
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:39,800
 people have gone on the record, but a number have not and may not even be aware that there

1011
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:44,360
 are potential health care issues arising from the radiation.

1012
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:49,000
 But am I not correct that if radiation was coming from the site, something was left there

1013
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,080
 from which the radiation was coming? Radiation is like a light beam. If you take the source

1014
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:57,520
 away, the source of light away, there isn't any light. Take the source of radiation away,

1015
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,040
 there isn't any radiation unless you leave something there that is irradiating. What was

1016
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:06,040
 left there?

1017
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,040
 I don't know, sir.

1018
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:13,840
 Okay. I'd be very curious what was left there that was radiating. You said that the trees

1019
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:22,200
 were scorched, but when it took off, there was no heat. There was no backwash. And why

1020
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:27,600
 would there be indentations in the soil? Because you saw it hovering. It wasn't even touching

1021
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,600
 the soil.

1022
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:34,600
 That's the way it appeared, sir. It would be hovering. But the only thing it was emulating

1023
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:39,440
 on it was light, and not unless the light caused indentions. I don't know. It's beyond

1024
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,780
 my -- I can guess on it.

1025
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:51,160
 One last question. Sometimes we have things so difficult to deal with that we don't deal

1026
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:56,980
 with them. They're locked away in our mind, and they're accessible only through hypnosis.

1027
01:38:56,980 --> 01:39:02,640
 You said that when you came out of the hypnotic state, that the hypnotist seemed somewhat

1028
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:03,640
 --

1029
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:04,640
 Distressed.

1030
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,640
 Distressed, whatever word.

1031
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,600
 Yes, she was. She was distressed.

1032
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:14,760
 Did she write a report that is available? What did you tell her under hypnosis that

1033
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,480
 made her respond that way?

1034
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:22,280
 Well, I went into the incident. The problem that she was having in what created a second

1035
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:30,960
 hypnosis was when I got to the landing site, I would jump to OSI. I'd be in the OSI room.

1036
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:35,480
 And she says -- she's read about this. She says, "But I'm not sure." And she says, "What

1037
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:40,240
 I'm thinking it is," she says, "I think your memory's been blocked." And she says, "Now,

1038
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:43,700
 why would they do that?" And I says, "I don't know."

1039
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:47,560
 Both of you fell down when there was a light from this. Does that understand that?

1040
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:48,560
 Yes, sir.

1041
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:53,120
 Do you have any idea how long you were on the ground before you got up?

1042
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,120
 Seconds.

1043
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:58,720
 But that's what you -- when I go under anesthetic, I -- five hours, and it doesn't seem like

1044
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:02,680
 I have any time as a lapse. How do you know it was seconds?

1045
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:09,960
 Well, there is a time distortion. I mean, that -- you can get with adrenaline and things

1046
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:15,560
 like that. It can -- you know, more time can go by than actually that you realize. I understand

1047
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:26,120
 that. The craft was on the ground of 45 minutes. I mean, it's not like it was -- the reason

1048
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:31,480
 we know exactly the minutes on that, by the way, is after we got back in, our watches

1049
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:34,080
 were all 45 minutes off.

1050
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,440
 Oh, gosh.

1051
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:39,080
 Your watches were 45 minutes off, so maybe you were unconscious for 45 minutes.

1052
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,640
 I wasn't unconscious. I mean, I --

1053
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:47,400
 But, sir, if you become unconscious and become conscious again, you may have no sense of

1054
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:53,160
 that. I can put a hood over your head, and you will breathe nitrogen, and you will become

1055
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:57,360
 unconscious. And if I then give you oxygen, you will be conscious, and you will have no

1056
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:02,480
 knowledge that you were unconscious. To your knowledge, you were not unconscious. That

1057
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,640
 doesn't mean that you weren't unconscious.

1058
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:07,640
 Well, every time I've been given anesthetic, I know I was under anesthetic.

1059
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:12,760
 There's some little trauma going under anesthesia, but in this case, there wasn't any.

1060
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:16,680
 One interesting note was the shift commander confirmed they lost radio contact with us

1061
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,280
 for over 45 minutes.

1062
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:19,280
 Correct.

1063
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:24,200
 Okay. But I'm very curious what that 45 minutes was. Maybe you were unconscious for 45 minutes.

1064
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,200
 I have no idea.

1065
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:26,200
 It's possible.

1066
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,200
 Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.

1067
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:31,640
 You're very welcome. We're nearing our break, but I am going to allow Senator Gravel to

1068
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:34,880
 have two minutes to comment to you, and then we'll have a break.

1069
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:41,600
 You made a statement that there was another military personnel, female personnel who drove

1070
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:51,200
 up and her car or her vehicle was shut off, not by her, and how did she get out? And did

1071
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:57,480
 she suffer any disabilities as a result of this?

1072
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:01,600
 Two things that stand out with that. Now, at one point, her vehicle was shut down. She

1073
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:06,360
 was relieved of duty, and in fact, she should have been the on-duty shift commander on the

1074
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:11,760
 night of Colonel Hall's incident. She wasn't present. At our level, we would not have been

1075
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:18,440
 briefed on what treatment she received or what the final outcome was, but not only was

1076
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:23,800
 her vehicle shut down, but on the third night, the light-offs and radios were malfunctioning.

1077
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,560
 They couldn't even get the lights to come on out in the fields, which clearly points

1078
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,560
 towards there was some kind of electrical interference.

1079
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:38,480
 And this has been reported. Mr. Pope, is this part of the record that there was a general

1080
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:43,960
 shutdown of electrical service or energy service during this period of time?

1081
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:48,440
 I can't recall, sir, whether the documents say that, but Colonel Holt and a number of

1082
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:54,360
 the other people, but particularly Holt, because he was the deputy base commander, has gone

1083
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:56,960
 on the record and confirmed that. Yes, sir.

1084
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,840
 Good. Thank you, Madam Chairman.

1085
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:03,840
 You're very welcome. We now come to a 15-minute break time. Our witnesses will rejoin us,

1086
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,160
 and I'm getting another note.

1087
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,160
 Yes, yes.

1088
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:07,160
 Okay. Is that the congressman?

1089
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,160
 I apologize.

1090
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:12,120
 That's okay. Just for a moment, Congressman Cook has asked for an additional minute.

1091
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:19,420
 Well, even just 30 seconds. I meant to ask you this earlier, Sergeant Burroughs. You indicated

1092
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:26,640
 you were promoted to sergeant after this incident occurred. Can you give us some indication

1093
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:36,880
 of maybe the year or two after the incident occurred, any thing you said? Clearly they

1094
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:43,080
 weren't denying you of being a member of the Air Force at that time, so I'm trying to just

1095
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:50,880
 understand did you kind of, well, were you being politically correct for a year or two,

1096
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:56,480
 and then what I'm trying to understand is the time scale on when they started saying

1097
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,360
 that you weren't even a member of the Air Force. Do you understand?

1098
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:04,840
 Yes, sir. That just came up on our inquiries that are going on now that when I did get

1099
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:09,640
 a little bit of my records released, there was no DD form 214 in there, and also the

1100
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:14,840
 fact that the doctor that was interviewing me that day said there was no record. Now,

1101
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:19,300
 that doesn't mean that technically the Air Force is saying that I wasn't in. What they're

1102
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:25,200
 trying to do is show that whatever part of the incident took place is classified in my

1103
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:30,400
 records or in those files, and one other interesting note I want to bring up to you, a few years

1104
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:34,880
 after the incident, I went down to Maxwell Air Force Base, and I went into the, you know

1105
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,800
 how they keep the history of the wings in the base. I went in and requested the history

1106
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:45,200
 of the wing, the 81st Tech Fighter Wing in 1980. When they gave me the files, December

1107
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:50,920
 of 1980 was missing. It was pulled and was classified.

1108
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:57,240
 So maybe that's why you were promoted. Well, I don't know. I'm not making a statement

1109
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,240
 here. I just wanted to get a better sense of it.

1110
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:01,400
 We've got a couple announcements from Mr. Bookman before we go on recess, and we will

1111
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:04,920
 be back in 15 minutes, and the same witnesses will see you at that time.
