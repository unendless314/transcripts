1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 It's called the Hearing Back to Order.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,320
 It's been wonderful.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,440
 We are into our last 50, 60 minutes of it, and it's, again, an honor to have chaired

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,640
 it and all of my members who have been invited to come, we appreciate your time as well.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,480
 Many have said they appreciate our time, and we think it's a mutual thing because there's

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,440
 -- in Congress, you can only be good at a couple things, and those are your major two

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,680
 committees, and you rely on others to help you get through the mirage of all of the rest

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,680
 of it.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,360
 And this is new for many of us, and we appreciate you very much.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,800
 We thought in this last hour or so that we'd go back to the panel first, if you have any

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
 comments that you'd like to make, and then the members will question, and then the members

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
 will have closing remarks.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,880
 We'll try to make time for that, and if you'd like to make a closing remark as well, we'll

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
 do that.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,200
 I'd like to start off with this session with one question for all of you experienced men

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,960
 of this government and otherwise.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:07,500
 Why do you believe today and 30, 40 years ago, the military primary -- primarily has

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,600
 suppressed the whole idea of what might be unidentified flying objects or extraterrestrial?

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,720
 And we can start anywhere, but why do you think they've done that?

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
 Never mentioned it again?

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,980
 Act like it never happened?

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,280
 It didn't really happen?

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,360
 You know, those kinds of things.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,920
 Is there something we ought to know there?

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,760
 Anybody got a comment on that?

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
 Sure.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,760
 First of all, I think it's the technology factor.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,960
 If they do have tangible objects in hand and have learned some technology, that is a very

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
 valuable stuff.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,160
 That we don't have.

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,760
 Technology that we don't currently have.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,400
 That they have recovered, yes.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,360
 Oh, that they've recovered of ours.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,440
 If they have recovered, UFO technology, that is very valuable stuff, and that's worth keeping

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,000
 a secret.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,920
 The other thing is, if they were to let the general public know that they have no control

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,640
 over these objects, that they chase them, they can't catch them, that's something they

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,120
 didn't want the public to really know.

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,920
 Those are very good.

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,400
 The first being that our country may have acquired some new technology that we learned

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,400
 from them.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
 Was that your first point?

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 Was your point something like that?

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
 That was my first point.

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
 If they have recovered technology.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
 Okay.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
 All right.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
 And the second point.

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
 That is one reason for keeping it secret.

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,240
 The other one is they wouldn't want the public to know that they have no control over these

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,680
 objects.

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,320
 These objects that are seemingly controlled by some kind of intelligence.

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,720
 And why would they not want the public to know that we don't know what's there, or that

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 they might be superior?

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
 Mr. Scott?

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,640
 They're afraid that we would panic.

57
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
 We as a people?

58
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
 We as a country?

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,800
 As a country, as the world, they're afraid that western civilization would collapse,

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,960
 western religion would collapse.

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,240
 Your mind can go crazy on thinking the worst thing.

62
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,680
 And if you say, well, let's bring a one world government into this for a defense, well,

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,000
 that could prove to be a one world dictatorship also.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,040
 So I can understand why the military and intelligence is keeping a lid on this until they might

65
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,240
 feel safe to let the cat out of the bag, but it's going to happen anyway.

66
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
 Yeah.

67
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
 And those are very good points.

68
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
 Both of those.

69
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,960
 I'm going to let Mrs. Hollis and I'm going to come to Mr. Dole.

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
 Okay.

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:02,560
 I'll just take the obvious in regards to my case, and that is these objects know in great

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,760
 detail how our missiles operate.

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,080
 They know ours, but we don't know theirs.

74
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
 That's right.

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,240
 They can shut down our missiles at any time.

76
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,800
 They have proven that.

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,280
 They know in great detail how they operate.

78
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:27,880
 And so if you release that information to public, what do you say then about, you know,

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,040
 what kind of defense do we have against these things?

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
 Anyone else?

81
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
 Yes, sir.

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
 Captain.

83
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,240
 Well, they could shut our missiles down until we put EMF filters on our missiles in the

84
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:48,280
 early '70s, and by '76, they couldn't shut them down, because in my opinion of the EMF

85
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,760
 filters and some of the documentation that Robert Salles got unsealed, I looked at and

86
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:01,440
 found, in fact, in '68, after studying his shutdowns, they were looking at EMF as a problem.

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,280
 And I do distinctly remember our missiles being pulled offline one at a time before

88
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,200
 our incident happened and asked one of the members of the security maintenance teams,

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,240
 and they let it out of the bag that it was an EMF filter, and then they got shushed for

90
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
 it.

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,440
 And I also accompanied a nuclear warhead or crew duty.

92
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,200
 Additional duty would be to do that on a convoy where we took a nuclear warhead out to a missile

93
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,700
 site to be replaced, to swap it out.

94
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:40,260
 So in my opinion, the EMF filters caused a problem to these entities until they worked

95
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,360
 around that by the time in 2010.

96
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,800
 I don't want to disagree with Mr. Vestermarker, but I would like to point out that about the

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,960
 incident that I just mentioned in 2010, the jury's still out as to whether or not that

98
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:05,400
 was a UFO incident where 50 nuclear missiles were shut down while objects were seen overhead.

99
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,880
 But I certainly agree that after our incident in the early days, electromagnetic pulse or

100
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:21,160
 electromagnetic force was considered a possible cause for the shutdowns, and the Air Force

101
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,880
 did have an active program to improve the EMP protection.

102
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
 Mr. Darlan?

103
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
 Yes.

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,240
 I think the answers of technology and panic are probably top of the list.

105
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,960
 Certainly if even one artifact of a UFO were ever recovered, and those who've studied this

106
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,720
 matter in detail most believe that that is the case, one can easily see why that would

107
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,080
 be of paramount interest to keep from other parties that you don't want to have that technology.

108
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,080
 So the only way to do that for sure is to deny that there's a phenomenon that exists

109
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
 whatsoever.

110
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,920
 But we actually know from the declassified literature that even as early as 1947, there

111
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,760
 were wind tunnel tests of disk-shaped airframes that were being conducted at Wright Field

112
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:17,160
 in Dayton, Ohio, and these were explicitly based on UFO sightings.

113
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,800
 We have a document from October 1947 authored by Colonel Wentworth, I believe, in which

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,120
 he references this.

115
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,600
 So the obvious connection between UFO sightings alone and technological development is right

116
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,980
 there from the beginning.

117
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,600
 But the idea of panic is the worst, because what we find in many cases is that panic can

118
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,520
 escalate very quickly. 30 years ago in the lower New York state, Hudson Valley, for about

119
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,520
 three, four years there were a series of unbelievably incredible sightings by thousands of people.

120
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,800
 This got the attention very quickly of national media by 1984.

121
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,760
 The FAA quickly and clearly had, what could they literally say to the world?

122
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,160
 "Yes, there's these enormous boomerang-shaped objects flying over the Taconic Parkway.

123
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,600
 But don't worry, even though we don't know who they are, we don't think they're here

124
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
 to eat us."

125
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,280
 There's just nothing that you could say, literally, to the public that would assuage their fears.

126
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,320
 In 1997 over Phoenix, we have the incident of the famous Phoenix Lights, in which Governor

127
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,480
 Fife Symington at a press conference a few days later brought out a big guy in an alien

128
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,120
 costume and basically through cold water over the whole thing ridiculed it.

129
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:38,520
 Ten years later, Governor Symington at this national press conference in 2007 said, not

130
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:45,960
 only did we have to do that to prevent public panic, which was in danger of escalating greatly

131
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,840
 at that moment, but I myself saw the object in question and it was unbelievable and he

132
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,240
 offered his strong opinion. He's an experienced pilot, by the way, that this is not anything

133
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
 from our civilization.

134
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:08,200
 I've had an opportunity to visit three or four aircraft carriers that a hundred or more

135
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:15,440
 planes can fly off of in my defense experience and the young men and women on ship who, nuclear

136
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,440
 submarines I might ask, aircraft carriers as well as nuclear submarines, I've seen

137
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:29,200
 the nukes lined up on the submarine, I don't know, 1,500 deep look like in rows.

138
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,720
 We are supposedly the defense country of the world. If there's something in our atmosphere

139
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,640
 in the world that may question that, it seems to me, this member, that we need to take a

140
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,360
 look at it. If they wanted to blow us up, seems like they'd have done it 20, 30, 40

141
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,240
 years ago. Maybe they want to coexist, but to not even begin to, whatever, you guys got

142
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,160
 more intelligence than I have. It's just the wrong way. I mean, there won't be a world.

143
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
 Who wants that?

144
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:08,160
 Then my last one at this time would be the press, the press, very, very powerful. Do

145
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,560
 any of you know of any occasions where the press might have been, I don't know, caused

146
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,960
 to go one way or the other? Positive or make joke of it or all? Captain Salas?

147
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:30,080
 Thank you, Ms. Gilpatrick. In 2004, I was contacted by the Peter Jennings group who's

148
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:38,880
 putting together a UFO special and flown to Dallas, Texas for about two or three days.

149
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,080
 They interviewed me for a couple of days, got a lot of footage, said I had great testimony

150
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:54,440
 and they were going to feature my testimony on their special. With a week before that

151
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,560
 special, the Peter Jennings special on UFOs was to be broadcast. I got a call saying that

152
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,080
 they couldn't, they wouldn't be using my interview. There are other members here in

153
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:19,360
 the audience that were also interviewed for this. To me, they gave me no reason. I'm just

154
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,120
 suspicious that somebody got to them and did not want this story out.

155
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,280
 Anyone else have any press? Before we go to the members, does anyone else at the table

156
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,640
 like to make a final statement as we go through? It may not be your final because we're going

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,160
 to interact a little bit longer, but if you want to add something at this point, otherwise

158
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,320
 I'll go right. Mr. Scott, Sergeant Scott?

159
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:49,120
 I'd like to see the military and the local police be able to have their people, if they

160
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,280
 see a sighting or respond to a sighting, to be able to give an honest report of it. Because

161
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:05,280
 if it's a lie, if it's a joke and that, it's very easy to find that out quickly. If it's

162
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:14,040
 not, then what we're doing is gathering more intelligence information on a possible friend

163
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:22,320
 out there or a possible enemy. The more information we gather, the better it is for us. Right

164
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,320
 now the police department, my brother's a retired policeman, they would send a rookie

165
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,360
 cop out to investigate. They didn't want to do it. They would laugh about it. But once

166
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,520
 he found out I was coming here, then he got more serious after all these years and they

167
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,600
 told me he believed also.

168
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:51,280
 Very good. Thank you. Are you hearing, sir? Okay. Let me then open it up to our members

169
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,640
 for our final or we can have some dialogue for a little while. Let me start with Councilman

170
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
 Bartlett.

171
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:07,160
 Thank you. I've been looking at some of the press clippings from yesterday's session and

172
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:14,880
 the government has been quite successful in relegating this issue to the lunatic fringe.

173
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,480
 I have several articles. I'm going to comment on only one of them and I really don't know

174
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,840
 where it played. It says the mock Congress hearing on aliens is heavy on real-life Mulders

175
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:32,560
 and not Scullies. I didn't know who Mulders and Scullies were until I read it. But apparently

176
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,880
 in the X-Files, Agent Fox Mulder believes in all things, little green men, Roswell men

177
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,480
 in black, whatever, and Agent Dana Sculley believes in science. Sculley forces Mulder

178
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,200
 to find hard evidence that there's a massive conspiracy to cover up aliens' existence.

179
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,960
 The problem with this week's alien panel, that we're an alien panel now, at the National

180
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,520
 Press Club is that any of the participating members of Congress who might nationally be

181
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:05,080
 a Scully have been incented to suspend their disbelief because the Citizen Hearing Foundation

182
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:12,240
 is paying them $20,000 plus expenses to listen to the testimony. That's just insulting that

183
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:24,360
 we can be bought for $20,000. That's ridiculous. It goes on to say that panelists, and I mention

184
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,600
 the panelists and I'm one of the panelists, and former member Roscoe Bartlett, in an opening

185
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,640
 statement, Bartlett said he hadn't fulfilled his duty in office by failing to hold hearings

186
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:43,480
 on extraterrestrials. I never said that. What I had said was that the Congress, I a part

187
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,440
 of it, had failed in its responsibility to respond to the constitutional requirement

188
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:57,280
 that we had a responsibility to respond to people to petition their government for a

189
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,560
 redress of grievances. It's in the First Amendment. It's very clear. I never said that I believed

190
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,000
 in extraterrestrials. I believe that there are sightings out there that cannot be easily

191
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,720
 explained away. That is one of the possible explanations of them. There may be others.

192
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,760
 But I never made that statement. Compounding the problem of eyebrow-raising testimonies

193
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,280
 that several of these politicians have reputations for being a little wacky.

194
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:34,120
 What does that end? Who said that? I don't know. Who said that? Who wrote it?

195
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,240
 I don't know. You tell me. No, no. Who's it from? What network of paper?

196
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,200
 I don't know. I can't tell you. This is the article. You tell me where it came from.

197
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:52,480
 It's terrible. It's terrible. Yeah. I want to read on. This is why I'm wacky. Bartlett

198
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 has warned of the dangers of an electromagnetic pulse, a theoretical nuclear blast in space

199
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,080
 that would fry electrical circuits and kill the Internet. This is not theoretical.

200
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,400
 We did precisely that in 1962 over at Johnson Island. It's called Starfish Prime, and it

201
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,280
 shut down – we didn't have any electronics in '62. It shut down electrical equipment

202
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:21,160
 in Hawaii 800 miles away. The Congress set up an EMP commission. It functioned for eight

203
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,760
 years for four congresses. It was chaired by Dr. Bill Graham, the science advisor to

204
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,680
 President Reagan. Johnny Foster was on it, the father of most of our nuclear weapons.

205
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,880
 Dr. Joan Woodard was on it. She is the deputy director at Sandia Labs. And Dr. Lowell Wood

206
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,960
 from Lawrence Livermore was on it. This is the person that Tom Clancy told me, and his

207
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,920
 view was the smartest man hired by the U.S. government. That commission functioned for

208
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,920
 eight years. As a result of their functioning, the Pentagon has set up a permanent commission

209
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:05,160
 of permanent panel task force on EMP. John Kyle has made a statement that says that this

210
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,560
 is one of the few – as a matter of fact, I think it's the only event I know of – that

211
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:15,440
 could end us as a sovereign nation. You can read his comment on that.

212
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:24,440
 You know, I'm just insulted that the press does this. You know, these statements have

213
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,960
 no basis in reality. And I want to point out something else, how successful they've been.

214
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:37,120
 Here is a fact sheet that is put out by the Air Force. And it's about Unidentified Flying

215
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:45,320
 Objects and Air Force Project Blue Book. They did everything they could to debunk 12,800

216
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:53,760
 – 618 sightings, but 701 of them they could not find any way to rationalize it away. That's

217
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:01,400
 a pretty large number. And then they make two statements. You know, one thing they say

218
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,740
 is that there was never any indication of threat to our national security. Then why

219
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,200
 in heck the classification, the secret classification, that there's no threat to our security?

220
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,920
 Most of these things are just mutually exclusive, aren't they? You can't say one and then

221
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,800
 not – and then say the other. They said there was no evidence submitted to or discovered

222
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,680
 by the Air Force that sightings categorized as unidentified represented technology developed

223
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:32,400
 – developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge. It reminds

224
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,200
 me of Goebbels in his statement, "Just say it often enough, no matter how big the lie

225
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:48,040
 and people will soon believe it." We have radar tracks. We have radar tracks showing

226
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,520
 that these objects, whatever they are, behave in ways that known aircraft of no country

227
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:02,800
 in the world can do. That just isn't true. There was no evidence indicating that sightings

228
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,680
 categorized as unidentified were extraterrestrial vehicles. That's true. But there is a lot

229
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,920
 of evidence – but there was a lot of evidence – that they couldn't be anything that

230
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:22,040
 is publicized by either our country or by Russia or by China. China is now entering

231
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:29,720
 as a player in this – in this domain. I'm generally a pretty quiet individual, but you

232
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,800
 know, this press – this press stuff is just clear – clearly outrageous. The audacity

233
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,240
 and the ignorance of something like that just infuriates me.

234
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
 (Applause.)

235
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:50,840
 And then this same press that is ridiculing what we're doing today is totally silent

236
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,600
 when the Air Force puts out a fact sheet like this that is anything but a fact sheet because

237
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,400
 there are statements on it that are clearly, clearly not true. You know, this – there

238
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,720
 has to be an accountability for this, does there not? Thank you for holding this hearing.

239
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
 Thank you.

240
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
 (Applause.)

241
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
 Thank you. Thank you.

242
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
 (Applause.)

243
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
 Congresswoman Woesey.

244
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:22,000
 Well, I have a thought. And the thought is, once there can be disclosure about what is

245
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,440
 out there and what is coming in and an understanding, which will take certainly hearings within

246
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,200
 the Congress and in the House and the Senate. But we have a big question, and that question

247
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:45,280
 is, are we doing this because we are going to arm space? And you know, let's just talk

248
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:54,900
 about getting rid of humanity in general. One more war, but it's up there in space.

249
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:02,280
 We don't want to do that. And I just think this is the sneaky way to get there by not

250
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:15,200
 admitting that there's all of this challenge out there. And I honestly believe that the

251
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:27,840
 visitors, the UFOs, have shown us what they can do. I mean, they can turn off full nuclear

252
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:36,800
 sites. And they don't have -- that's probably why we have seen less and less recently because

253
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:45,280
 they've done what -- you know, if humans can't figure out what they're capable of, then there's

254
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,040
 no -- they don't need to show us any other way. Because I don't -- they obviously -- they

255
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:59,280
 may be -- probably aren't violent, because if they were -- did what they're capable of,

256
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,360
 they'd probably be eating some of us. You know?

257
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
 Annihilating.

258
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:13,920
 But they're annihilating us, yes. And we don't, you know, come on. We need to talk about this.

259
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:23,680
 We need to be furious how the press is covering it. And they will. But thank you, everybody.

260
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,600
 And we've got three more days of this, you know. So we'll be thanking, I guess, until

261
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:34,640
 the cows come home here. But we've got some work to do. And our world has some work to

262
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,280
 do, not just the United States of America. So thank you, Madam Chairman.

263
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
 Sure.

264
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
 Senator?

265
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,800
 Well, I'm sorry I ruined his afternoon, because I brought the press stuff to his attention.

266
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
 [laughter]

267
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,000
 It's garbage. I mean, it's garbage. But does that surprise you? I would ask one question

268
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,080
 on the Peter Jennings. Did they go on with the show?

269
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,680
 Yes, sir, they did.

270
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
 They just took you out.

271
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,160
 They just took me out. And I think --

272
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,560
 Did they have any good evidence in the show at all?

273
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
 Not in my opinion.

274
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
 Good.

275
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,440
 I mean, that's par for the course for mainstream media. He brought to my attention, so he's

276
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,820
 ruining my afternoon. This is the fact sheet put out by the government. There is no evidence

277
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:29,360
 indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified were extraterrestrial. What else could they

278
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,320
 be? There's no -- I mean -- and this, I think -- I want to hit a couple of you on this.

279
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,760
 You know, you could say, "Well, we're skeptical." Sure, I'm skeptical of everything. But by

280
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,560
 the same token, if there's no other rational reason for something, you have to come to

281
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:53,640
 a conclusion. And the conclusion I can share with you, which is just logic, is if there's

282
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:00,800
 anything in this whole compendium of knowledge of UFOs, it's got to be what happened at Minot

283
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,960
 and Wyoming and so forth. What's been proven is that somebody out there, extraterrestrial,

284
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,320
 can shut off our defense capability just like that. Just like that. Now, how do you think

285
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,320
 that makes the people in Congress who are appropriating billions and billions of dollars

286
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,640
 for a defense system that doesn't work if you really push the shove?

287
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
 (Applause.)

288
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:32,300
 And so if there's ever a rationale for the government in cahoots with the military-industrial

289
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:39,320
 complex to defend the appropriation process that feeds them, it's got to be what's been

290
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,960
 discovered and they've got to put a lid on this. I mean, this makes these -- all this

291
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,880
 wealth obsolete. I'll give you an example of what happened recently. It happened in Alaska.

292
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:58,540
 You know, we've got these silos in Alaska. We've got 16 of them. And, of course, nobody's

293
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,840
 proven that they work, except the phony testing that's been done. Now, as soon as this -- we

294
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,640
 had this craze with North Korea. What happened? They appropriated money for another 14 silos.

295
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:19,960
 That will make 13 silos to go after North Korea. And I don't know if any of you know

296
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:28,000
 the defense concept. It's more expensive to build a shield than to build a spear. So you

297
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,160
 build all the shields you want. All they do is have more spears to get by your shields.

298
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:42,080
 So this is the first thing I learned in one of the hearings on this subject. So it doesn't

299
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,640
 take -- you have to go very far to realize that what we have here is the goods of why

300
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:56,200
 the simple, simple rational formulation that this threatens the entire Defense Department's

301
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:03,520
 capability. And so deny it. It doesn't happen. It doesn't exist. Anybody talks about it,

302
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,760
 they're idiots. And so the press goes along with this. And we go back to our conclusion

303
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:16,920
 of yesterday. You know, I tried to conclude that we have a country ruled by juntas, military

304
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:24,920
 juntas and corporations in cahoots with our corporations. But what's been raised, and

305
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:30,720
 I hate to monopolize it on -- but maybe this afternoon is going to go too fast, but stop

306
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,320
 and think what we've concluded. That we're supposed to -- now, we didn't take an oath

307
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,520
 here. You took an oath. We didn't take an oath. But obviously you assume that all politicians

308
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:51,620
 are truthful. Well, that's a fair sum. But let me point out to you that the hope is,

309
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,880
 is that we will go back to members of Congress and try to persuade them as to the knowledge

310
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,520
 that we've acquired. Well, I for one will confess, I don't know anybody in a sense that

311
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,600
 I could approach that could give me five minutes' time on this particular subject, before or

312
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,800
 after the hearing. But what this hearing has done is not so much that it's going to persuade

313
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,880
 Congress. It's a first step to persuading the American public, or getting information

314
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,960
 out to the public. And that's where I think the great benefit and the contribution made

315
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,080
 with this hearing. But I just want to add one thing, and I'll follow through on it tomorrow

316
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,120
 or the day after. And that is, it's fine. We can educate the public. But does the public

317
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,760
 have any power to act on this new knowledge that they have? I don't see that. All they

318
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,580
 can do on election day is vote for people like us, who when we're there don't pay attention

319
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:55,560
 to this. This is the problem we have. So I leave it at that. I was going to ask about

320
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:02,800
 the $20,000. They're complaining about $20,000. This is five days, eight hours for five days.

321
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,020
 When the likes of these pundits go out and speak, they get $30,000 for an hour. They

322
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:16,700
 get $100,000 for an hour and a half. I mean, it's ridiculous that it took, that this is

323
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,520
 raised by, and it was raised in an interview. Somebody raised it with me. And I says, "Well,

324
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,920
 what do you get paid when you're out on a stump?" This was somebody from Fox. And he

325
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:33,060
 confessed. $25,000, $30,000 is what he gets for an hour. And we're putting in 40 hours

326
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:42,440
 here. So we're underpaid, if anything, based upon the knowledge that we have.

327
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,320
 So I think we've concluded the reason for the cover-up. And that's really what we discovered

328
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,340
 today, this afternoon, was that somebody can shut off our defense just like that. And it's

329
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,260
 an embarrassment to the Air Force. It's an embarrassment to the federal government. It's

330
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:05,080
 an embarrassment to the Congress. And, of course, nobody wants to face that embarrassment.

331
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,400
 That I yield. I reserve the balance of my time in case I want to come back.

332
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,880
 That's right. That's right. Thank you, Senator, very much.

333
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
 Thank you.

334
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
 Congresswoman Hooley?

335
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,680
 Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. First of all, I'd like to thank our panel. You have been

336
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:32,080
 terrific. And anyone that wants to jump in and answer this question, I'm originally from

337
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,680
 North Dakota. I'm very familiar with Minot. So I have a problem with understanding why

338
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:46,040
 anyone would go to Minot. I'm sorry. That's not a good thing. I love you, North Dakota.

339
00:29:46,040 --> 00:30:05,220
 But wherever they come from, somebody is in Minot shutting off the missiles. Why? I mean,

340
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:17,780
 is that to show us that they can do that? Why would you do that?

341
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:23,680
 First of all, the world is facing a crisis right now about nuclear weapons. I don't have

342
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:30,360
 to remind you about those possibilities in countries that are trying to acquire nuclear

343
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:39,000
 weapons. And we've had enough nuclear weapons to destroy every living thing on Earth for

344
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:48,760
 a long, long time. And it would not take much to start a nuclear war, in my opinion. And

345
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:55,960
 that risk is getting worse. So I do believe that -- and I think they are extraterrestrial,

346
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:04,720
 and this is just my opinion -- that they are here to at least point to the fact that we

347
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:13,880
 are on the verge of annihilation, of suicide, if you will, our own civilization. And they

348
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:21,640
 would like to see us get rid of these weapons. And that's a message I got from my incident.

349
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,780
 It's my own conclusion that this was strictly a message. Get rid of your weapons. Get rid

350
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,280
 of those nuclear weapons. They are not weapons of war, by the way. They're weapons of mass

351
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:41,000
 destruction. They would never be used in a real war, because it would just be a complete

352
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,400
 suicide for civilization, like I said.

353
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:53,280
 Anyone else want to jump in? Yes. Sergeant Scott? Yeah. In June of 2001, President Bush

354
00:31:53,280 --> 00:32:01,040
 came on scene on ABC News, and it was carried throughout the networks and in Popular Mechanics

355
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,720
 magazine. He had with him a general from the Air Force, and he was announcing that the

356
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,840
 general was going to be the head of a new military force called the Space Force, and

357
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,920
 they were going to build this force and also put a military base on the moon. Now nobody

358
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:27,600
 questioned him on why. What was the purpose for that? But then September 11th comes around.

359
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,320
 The terrorist attack comes. This general is posted as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs

360
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:43,340
 of Staff, and the Space Force never comes about. The question I have still, why did

361
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:51,640
 he want to create a new military force for outer space unless there's a threat? We have

362
00:32:51,640 --> 00:33:02,840
 one. We have a space force. It's in existence. And it's been written about extensively. It's

363
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:09,120
 there. Okay. All right. Some acknowledge it and some don't. But your point's well taken,

364
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,120
 Sergeant. Is that the Black Ops? Black Ops, that's the real. Well, yeah, I know. You want

365
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,800
 me to answer that? No. No, I won't. No. Let me go to Congress. Oh, I'm sorry. He jumped

366
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,560
 in. Right, I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. Continuous. Your time, Congresswoman. I'd like

367
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:37,140
 to hear from you. I just said what he's talking about is Black Ops. And I don't doubt that.

368
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:43,920
 But I'm concerned that they're trying to tell us. I don't quite totally agree with Bob,

369
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:50,440
 but I do agree with you. That's okay. I think they're at least trying to tell us to pay

370
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:59,840
 attention. We have the power to do this. Be careful. And one of my, I've got scenarios

371
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,360
 in my mind about, I've thought about this an awful lot. And one of my scenarios is perhaps

372
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:13,040
 in fact they've communicated with the leaders of the world and said back off from this stuff,

373
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,080
 or else you're going to annihilate yourself. And maybe that's why we cut back some of our

374
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:25,880
 missiles. And other scenarios, do these, I'll call them beings, do these entities, are we

375
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:32,240
 aware of these entities enough that they can go public instead of saying you can't handle

376
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,920
 the truth, we can't handle the truth, and going public with an innocuous thing like

377
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:47,360
 harmless beings that are visiting us just to keep in touch and everything's fine, or

378
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:56,320
 do they consider us a species like we consider apes a species, or dolphins, or perhaps rodents,

379
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:04,760
 or perhaps insects? You know, so that sort of thing I don't want to know about. If it's

380
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,960
 just the fact that they're visiting and they're kind of trying to tell us to watch out for

381
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,880
 nuclear, they can come forward with that. The government should come forward to let

382
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:20,440
 us know, to ease our minds a bit. However, if it's the other scenarios, I just want to

383
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:26,320
 come forward and lie to us and tell us the entities are nice beings and they just want

384
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:34,640
 to warn us about nuclear. I can't handle that truth that we're insects to these beings.

385
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,200
 Thank you so much. Yes, David?

386
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,800
 You've asked us to speculate. I don't know. You probably don't know.

387
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,200
 No, I don't.

388
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:55,640
 But these missiles being shut down, Captain Salas described two flights that he's aware

389
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:03,280
 of. I described to you one flight of 10 missiles that I'm aware of, but I'm also aware of other

390
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:11,400
 launch officers who've described to me similar situations. So, you know, it's not unique

391
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:20,240
 that him and I have been involved here. I mean, this was a situation that was occurring

392
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:28,120
 quite often when I served in 1966 and '67. And who knows that it's not still happening

393
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,880
 out there? There is no act of officers of any kind that will come out and admit that

394
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:40,600
 right now. But what I'd like to know is what's your speculation on these missiles being shut

395
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
 down?

396
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,040
 Is that rhetorical, or you need an answer?

397
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
 I'd like an answer to that.

398
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
 Okay, let me come back to you.

399
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
 Because I'm sure it would be just as good as my answer.

400
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,040
 I might have something to end on, too. Let me get --

401
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:58,880
 Let me offer one very -- 30-second opinion. I feel that we really do not have enough data,

402
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,000
 even now, to know exactly why this is happening. Because despite the number of cases where

403
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,520
 this does appear to have happened, there are thousands of missiles. And not all of them

404
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,560
 have been shut down, as far as we can tell. So if they're doing this, they're obviously

405
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:22,400
 not doing it uniformly. And I just -- I don't really feel that any researcher who has enough

406
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,320
 data to know precisely what those motivations might be. They obviously -- they seem to have

407
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,400
 demonstrated superiority over our technology. That's for sure. So at discrete moments, they

408
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,440
 seem to be able to do this. But they're not doing it uniformly. And they certainly haven't

409
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,920
 stopped all of the massive wars that have, you know, run over the planet. So there are

410
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,600
 certain limits as to what they're willing to do, as well.

411
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,680
 Thank you. And I yield back my time. Madam Chair?

412
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,280
 Thank you, Congresswoman -- Congressman Cook.

413
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:02,240
 Thank you. From the things that you've described today, you all must have done what Captain

414
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,640
 Fenstermarker just indicated he has done. That's think about these things a lot during

415
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,720
 the times when you didn't say too much -- anything publicly, and after you've come out and started

416
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,000
 speaking, which, again, I congratulate the two of you that have done that today, for

417
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,680
 I understand the first time. So I think -- I've got to say, I think your speculations are

418
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,000
 a lot more informed than what our speculations might be on this. So I'd like to start with

419
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,840
 Captain Salas. And each of you have also said, I think, if I'm wrong on this, correct me,

420
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,920
 but that you've -- that you all complied, as you were asked to do and required to do,

421
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,920
 with the nondisclosure statements, short -- almost immediately after you described to your seniors

422
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,840
 in the military what you had just witnessed. Am I correct on that?

423
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
 Yes, sir. You didn't?

424
00:38:52,840 --> 00:39:01,960
 See, I was involved in three sightings, three different bases, and not one time did I have

425
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,760
 to sign anything away. Okay, Sergeant Scott, I appreciate that clarification.

426
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:12,840
 But I'm right, for example -- let's start with Captain Salas. You signed those --

427
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
 Absolutely, sir.

428
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
 Okay, so --

429
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
 Nondisclosure statement.

430
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:21,960
 Absolutely. And I think your spec -- or your reasons that you might give this committee,

431
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,120
 this panel, as to both legitimate reasons why you might have been thinking over the

432
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,520
 years or at the time, that the Air Force might have asked you to do that, and the illegitimate

433
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,900
 reasons why they might have asked you to do that. There must -- you must have some idea

434
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:44,880
 on both sides of this what -- why did they make you come in and sign that right off the

435
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:52,880
 bat? I mean, and why were they then -- why were you then -- the whole culture was, don't

436
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,560
 talk about it, or you're going to be in trouble. What were the legitimate reasons for that,

437
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,640
 if there are -- if any, if any, or illegitimate reasons for that, if any?

438
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:08,800
 I think I discovered the main reason, and that is -- is this on? Okay. That the Conant

439
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:16,320
 investigation was ongoing at the time, and the idea of the Conant investigation basically

440
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:28,080
 was to give the Air Force a way out of investigating UFOs. And if they had allowed me to speak

441
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:39,080
 to the Conant investigator about my incident, and Mr. Fiegel, and Mr. Mywald, and Mr. Carlson,

442
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:46,240
 they would have discovered that this was really a serious problem. And so that, I think, was

443
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,720
 the primary reason they were so anxious to get us to sign these nondisclosure statements

444
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
 at the time.

445
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,600
 But that can also be very illegitimate, am I right? I'm talking about from the Air Force

446
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
 standpoint.

447
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:04,680
 Well, if they were honest about this, that would have been illegitimate.

448
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,640
 And my question is, what should they have done, and what should we start insisting the

449
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,840
 Air Force do?

450
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,060
 They should have been honest about it. They should have been straightforward about it,

451
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,880
 and let the people handle it. This belongs with the people. The people should decide

452
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,960
 something of this import, and not a small group of individuals in and out of government,

453
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,560
 which is what is going on right now. There is a small group of individuals, inside government

454
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,880
 and outside government, that are controlling this phenomenon. They're controlling the technology.

455
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,040
 They're controlling what's said about it. They're spreading disinformation about it.

456
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,200
 They are controlling the press, I think. And that's how they're keeping the ridicule factor

457
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
 going.

458
00:41:51,200 --> 00:42:00,640
 Well, 1967, '66, in your experience, that's 45 years ago.

459
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,060
 Forty-six. Yes, sir.

460
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:14,240
 Why aren't they releasing some of these statements by now, if you know, if you have any reasons

461
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,560
 for it? I mean, I just want to understand this as best I can. There's no way to pry open

462
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,080
 a can, unless you have the right tools to pry it open with.

463
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,880
 If you just want my opinion, I'll be glad to.

464
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,040
 Yes, well, that's what I'm asking. I want to know anybody else's opinion, if you have

465
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
 one.

466
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:38,560
 I do think it's about power and greed. It is not about concern for public safety. That

467
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,640
 window passed a long time ago. But right now, because they have discovered so much about

468
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:55,240
 the technology and many other things regarding this phenomenon, including paranormal subjects

469
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:02,640
 like telepathic thought, things like that, which are part of this phenomenon. We didn't

470
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,440
 talk about it, but it is part of the phenomenon. And the abductions that are going on, another

471
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:15,280
 part of this phenomenon. This is such a complex thing, that these secrets are so powerful.

472
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,600
 The men controlling this, men and women that are controlling this, I think the main motivation

473
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,880
 is power and greed.

474
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,080
 Captain, Professor Markham, we're going to ask you this then. You made the comments about

475
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:36,440
 the filters, and I don't know all the technical terms, but I was quite interested. The timing

476
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:45,000
 of those filters coming on to protect nuclear installations, and that was in the '70s, you

477
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 say?

478
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 '74, '75.

479
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:56,720
 Well, I would ask Captain Schindell and Captain Salson, isn't it likely or not that what you

480
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:04,480
 said to them, they believed you, because they started building technologies to protect against

481
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,360
 the very thing you were witnessing about? Am I right on that?

482
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:14,760
 Well, sir, as Mr. Bartlett pointed out, it was well known that nuclear explosions produce

483
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,360
 electromagnetic pulse.

484
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:25,400
 But they don't just appear to the point where you need filters for the silos. Well, go ahead.

485
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,000
 Excuse me, I didn't mean to.

486
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:37,780
 There was a bench test done at Boeing on the logic coupler, and it was shown in this bench

487
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:45,320
 test that at a certain frequency of EMP injected into the logic coupler that the coupler would

488
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:52,000
 be disabled. So they had that evidence. And so there's no doubt in my mind that one reason

489
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,720
 they tried to protect the missiles from EMP was nuclear explosions, but the other was

490
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:06,520
 as a result of the incident that I just described to help protect against UFO disabling the

491
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
 missiles.

492
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
 Of course, they knew that.

493
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,680
 Well, whether or not it was successful is another question.

494
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,680
 Okay.

495
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
 General, would you yield for just a moment?

496
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,680
 Certainly.

497
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:21,080
 I just wanted to make an observation about that. We are using these bench test facilities

498
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:28,920
 several times, noted deficiencies in our ballistic missile system. And we have corrected those.

499
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:36,400
 The last time we tested and the last time that we found deficiencies and fixed them,

500
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:44,680
 we never tested. We don't know whether they're fixed or not, but neither do the Russians.

501
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,680
 And so there's that big question, and that's how we left it. They aren't so sure what they'll

502
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,840
 work. We aren't dead sure they will work, but if there's any question about whether

503
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,760
 they will work or not, the mad philosophy still is offered, isn't it?

504
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,560
 Okay. I appreciate that. And also just wanted to quickly ask, and so it's a little bit unclear

505
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:12,040
 in your mind, Captain Solace, Captain Schindel, that these filters that came in the '70s that

506
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:22,960
 were described here today, that they could have been brought forth by the Air Force because

507
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,640
 they were finally getting to something they felt had occurred as early as the 19--or that

508
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,760
 they knew about as early as the 1950s or something they might have experienced from the testimony.

509
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,400
 Because they've also been what you had told them, either one maybe. Or is that--

510
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:44,680
 Well, I know I'm kind of into the weeds on this a little bit, and I apologize for that,

511
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,960
 but I just wanted to know whether--I mean, it really struck me when I heard Captain Fenster

512
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:59,200
 talk about--Fencemaster talk about the shields and the filters, that they had to have believed

513
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,960
 your testimonies and what you said you saw that day. They had to know that something

514
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:14,120
 was definitely happening, and then to keep this silent for 46 years as we've talked about.

515
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:20,080
 You know, I wasn't sure about this whole truth embargo even a few days ago, but this truth

516
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:27,040
 embargo indeed needs to start coming down.

517
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:38,520
 The document that Bob Salas had released was very lengthy, really, with three sub-documents,

518
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:45,100
 and I spent a lot of time scanning it. And in fact, there was a little piece about UFOs.

519
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:51,560
 What it was was a technical explanation of all the echo sites and what happened at each

520
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,760
 of the sites in the first document. And there was a little piece about UFOs, and it said,

521
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:05,920
 "The rumor of any UFO creating this is disproved, just disowned." Disowned, I think, wasn't

522
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,920
 it?

523
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,920
 It was disproven.

524
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,320
 The rumor was disproven. Now, I don't know how you disprove a rumor.

525
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:19,200
 But at the very end document, it was a '68 document where they talked about they were

526
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:28,160
 concerned with how EMF affected it, and that Boeing was going to work on the EMF problem.

527
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:37,040
 And I think what we installed was the result of his echo and Oscar flight and not his testimony,

528
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,320
 because it didn't happen.

529
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
 They didn't believe him.

530
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,160
 Just because they said they didn't believe him doesn't mean they didn't believe him.

531
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:51,120
 Yeah, but the technical aspects, they couldn't say it didn't happen, because the flight had

532
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,720
 all these errors, and this is what happened.

533
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,160
 I think you're being very humble, Mr. Captain, and all of you, because you probably create

534
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:08,000
 a lot more technology than you believe, or that you even are willing to talk about.

535
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 Thank you very much, Congressman.

536
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 Congressman Bartlett, did you have another comment you'd like to make?

537
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 Did you have another comment?

538
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,640
 Yes, thank you very much.

539
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,440
 I wanted to make a comment about the ballistic missile defense that Senator Gravell was talking

540
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,440
 about.

541
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,440
 He's correct.

542
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,560
 Our major ballistic missile defense is in Alaska.

543
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,520
 It will intercept missiles coming over the pole.

544
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,720
 Most of our potential enemies, the shortest route to get here is over the pole.

545
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,920
 In my judgment, I hope it will never be used, because the only time I think that it would

546
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,360
 be used is when the Russians, if they were to launch, and it would be very quickly swamped.

547
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,880
 They have thousands of missiles.

548
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,000
 If we're lucky, it would take out the first half dozen or so, and that's it.

549
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,040
 This system is really made to defend against countries like North Korea and Iran.

550
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,680
 These people may be evil.

551
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,920
 They are not idiots.

552
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,240
 They will not launch from their soil.

553
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,000
 I have no idea why we're waiting until they develop an intercontinental ballistic missile

554
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,540
 which will reach us.

555
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,480
 They know that we will know from where it was launched, and they know that within about

556
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,440
 30 minutes, they will be vaporized, the whole darn country.

557
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,440
 They are a huge threat, but the launch will not come from their soil.

558
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,080
 It will come from somewhere in the ocean.

559
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,480
 We have big coastlines, essentially totally unprotected, and they will not be protected.

560
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,360
 Even if we decide we need to protect them, they will not be protected for years, and

561
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,960
 that's where the real threat comes from.

562
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,440
 I think that the monies we have spent on our ballistic missile defense in Alaska are wasted

563
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,240
 monies because we cannot protect ourselves against Russia.

564
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,280
 In my judgment, they're the only country that would ever come over the pole, because

565
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,800
 if you have 100 weapons coming over, you know darn well where it came from.

566
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,680
 No one else has that many, so you know very well where it came from.

567
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,740
 It came from Russia, so they have no reason not to come over the pole.

568
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,440
 No one else has very many weapons, and they're not going to launch from their soil because

569
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,800
 they know that with our triad, with our submarines and so forth, they know within about 30 minutes,

570
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,040
 we would vaporize them.

571
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,720
 Do you think they would do that?

572
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,040
 That they're a huge threat, but it's from the ocean.

573
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,000
 It is not from their soil.

574
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 Thank you.

575
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 Thank you.

576
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 That was rhetorical.

577
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,120
 Don't feel compelled.

578
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,120
 Let me get up.

579
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,000
 Sir, Centres also want to make a final comment.

580
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 Oh, no.

581
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,440
 I want to follow through with that.

582
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,680
 Captain, you made a challenge to us to respond.

583
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,240
 Would you repeat that challenge?

584
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,120
 Well, you asked us to speculate on the reason.

585
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,120
 No, no.

586
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,160
 You were asking us something.

587
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,920
 Well, I asked you right back.

588
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
 What's your speculation?

589
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:52,440
 Well, here, and you're wondering whether or not we have forces in space.

590
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,400
 What do you think that all of these weapons are ICBMs in Alaska are about?

591
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,920
 Do you think they're about Korea?

592
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,360
 He's mentioned possibly Russia.

593
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,800
 They're not about Russia.

594
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:12,640
 We can, with our submarines, hold, one submarine can hold, which has got over 250 warheads,

595
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,720
 we can hold any, any people in the world hostage.

596
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:25,360
 Did you not notice a year ago, it's within a year, that the United States had a satellite

597
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:32,120
 and we let it come to Earth, and before it came into the atmosphere, we shot it down

598
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,200
 to make a demonstration that we have the capability of shooting down satellites in outer space?

599
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,680
 Do you recall that?

600
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
 Okay.

601
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,080
 Do you recall that six months later, the Chinese did the same thing to tell us tit for tat,

602
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,720
 you can do it, we can do it too?

603
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:53,040
 And what country, and of course, the amount of money we're spending to weaponize outer

604
00:52:53,040 --> 00:53:00,840
 space is, is a supreme idiocy of the American government, because we, well, we are the most

605
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,840
 vulnerable.

606
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:06,600
 If you talk to any scientist, any explosion in outer space, who's got the most satellites?

607
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,400
 I mean, you had to wipe out our whole communication system, you had to wipe out our economy.

608
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,440
 We're all dependent on satellites.

609
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,080
 So this is the kind of, of leadership and the appropriations that go forward in this

610
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,080
 idiocy.

611
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:25,280
 And now, when you talk about, you get a president of the United States, when we, we, we cut

612
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:32,640
 back, what, a hundred, a hundred nukes, and Russians cut back a hundred nukes, and we're

613
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,520
 breaking each other's arms, patting each other on the back.

614
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:43,640
 Think of the insanity of targeting Russia and China today.

615
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,240
 Our banker is China.

616
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:52,040
 Russia, all they want to do is, is sell gas and oil to Europe so they can live well.

617
00:53:52,040 --> 00:54:00,120
 And, and so it leaves you with the question mark, and, and this goes back to maybe the,

618
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,520
 and I'll end on this.

619
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:07,160
 You can be suspicious of, of what we don't know.

620
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:12,560
 But what we do know is so horrifying that you don't have any room for suspicion.

621
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,080
 It's a fact.

622
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,760
 And thank you very much for your testimony.

623
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,760
 I really enjoyed it.

624
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,760
 Thank you very much.

625
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,760
 Thank you.

626
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:24,280
 I want to take the prerogative of the chair, and, and just thank you all once again.

627
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:31,080
 We've had a wonderful day from bent waters to nuclear and all that you've done.

628
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:36,600
 Tomorrow promises to be the day three with Roswell and others we are anticipating.

629
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,800
 We have thoroughly enjoyed you as presenters, as an audience on the subject.

630
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,600
 I don't think we can solve it all tonight.

631
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:49,200
 You guys are light years ahead of most of us on it, but do know that you have our ear

632
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,560
 and that we look forward to working with you.

633
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,220
 Just know that your written testimony will be a come up our, part of our permanent document

634
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,600
 and this committee is adjourned.
