1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,780
 So if you're willing to do that, go ahead and stand.

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,900
 And stand, you can do it a second time, that's fine.

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,900
 Please repeat after me.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:25,220
 I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth to this committee

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,340
 today.

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:35,120
 Thank you.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,280
 Distinguished Congresswomen and Congressmen, good afternoon.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,600
 I personally would like to thank you for this opportunity to speak out on behalf of the

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,740
 many now passed through the portals of history, unable to speak for themselves.

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:56,080
 Men and women who have served this country selflessly and with honor, who are witnesses

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,000
 to something extraordinary, something beyond a human condition, most would maintain their

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,120
 sworn silence for a lifetime.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,360
 Others would eventually confide to their immediate loved ones or to us the truth of the matter.

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,900
 Moreover to these who this panel represents today, who so valiantly fought for freedom

15
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:24,640
 during World War II, who saved the world from Nazi domination, the fates were not finished

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,080
 with such devotion to their country.

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,840
 Within two years of the surrender of Germany and Japan, they would be called on again to

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:40,240
 lead us into an unprecedented awareness that we may be under another threat, another invader.

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,860
 However, this time not from any distant nation, but conceivably from across the vast distance

20
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,200
 of space.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,980
 Prior to the summer of 1947, visitors from other planets were strictly the fancy of science

22
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,980
 fiction writers.

23
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,540
 For lack of outside influence, spaceships were rockets and spacemen looked like our

24
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,560
 neighbors down the street, all of which were portrayed in popular TV series such as Flash

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,240
 Gordon and Buck Rogers during that time period.

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,080
 Nevertheless, the summer of 1947 would forever change that perception.

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,160
 Among others, highly skilled and professional people such as college professors, astronomers

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,160
 and commercial pilots were observing flying disks and military fighters were scrambled

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,500
 on these reported unknown aerial objects.

30
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,720
 From all accounts, they outperformed and outmaneuvered the best we could throw at the newly arrived

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
 phenomenon.

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,100
 Their very words, flying saucers, would forever become part of our vernacular.

33
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,800
 Many assumed they were of American design.

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,500
 Many believed Soviet.

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,020
 But then something happened in the high desert of New Mexico, which would alter the course

36
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,840
 of history.

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,640
 Ironically, the first atomic bomb wing, the 509th Bomb Group, was stationed at Roswell

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
 in 1947.

39
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,720
 This was a composite group assigned in the final months of the war, comprised of the

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:17,840
 best officers, pilots and their crews, doctors, nurses, all in one unit, all with top security

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,720
 clearances, the elite within the United States military, their mission to drop one, and if

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,800
 necessary, additional atomic bombs on Japan.

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,960
 Two years later, they would have another mission, unlike the first.

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,640
 This was an assignment to retrieve something which had dropped out of the sky.

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,080
 In addition, for those involved, who knew the truth, the stars would beckon with even

46
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,520
 greater brightness.

47
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,080
 On July 8th of 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field announced to the world they had captured

48
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,880
 a flying saucer on a ranch north of town.

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,880
 This is a matter of historic fact.

50
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,920
 The tractors would suggest that other UFO accounts are based on a faulty premise, that

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,120
 the phenomenon exists.

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,200
 The Roswell Incident in 1947 does not suffer any preconceived misinterpretation of the

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
 event.

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,080
 It entirely rests on the premise that the United States Army Air Corps recovered a crashed

55
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,960
 flying saucer.

56
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,480
 Historically, the first explanation lasted for all of five hours as it slowly evolved

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:40,200
 from something otherworldly into a very common off-the-shelf weather balloon device.

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,880
 Please allow me to propound a consideration for everyone here present.

59
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:54,060
 Would any of us have any difficulty identifying materials such as rubber, wooden sticks, reflective

60
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,380
 foil, masking tape, and string?

61
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,460
 No need to raise your hands.

62
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,240
 As a continuing insult to the integrity and intelligence of the very personnel who were

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,480
 in charge of the atomic bomb at Roswell, officialdom, after 65 years of ridicule and defamation

64
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:21,040
 of eyewitnesses, insists that this elite military squadron would all raise their hands.

65
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,080
 The balloon that was assembled and launched daily by these same personnel somehow morphed

66
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,640
 into wreckage that even by today's standards defied conventional explanation.

67
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,280
 Dozens of witnesses have described to us paper-thin, metal-like material that could not be damaged

68
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,120
 by any standard means.

69
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,320
 Yet, you could crumble it up, crush it into a ball, release your grip, and it would open

70
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,480
 up and flow like water over your hands.

71
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,640
 Was the balloon not a single witness to that alternative explanation?

72
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,640
 Since that time, due to eyewitness pressure, along with the assistance of one of your esteemed

73
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:10,800
 colleagues, the late Congressman Stephen Schiff of New Mexico, it caused the Pentagon to issue

74
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,440
 two additional solutions to what was recovered back in 1947.

75
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,560
 The third being Project Mogul, which was the exact same balloon contraption with the inclusion

76
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,480
 of an acoustic device.

77
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,560
 The fourth and most baseless of all, time-traveling wooden crash dummies parachuted five years

78
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,520
 later in 1952.

79
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,480
 Even Jay Leno made jest about such fodder after the Pentagon disclosed its fourth version.

80
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:50,160
 Video writers and newspaper cartoonists lampooned the very suggestion and indicated proponents,

81
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,680
 indicted proponents as the real dummies.

82
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,960
 To think we now have four official versions of one historic event.

83
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,240
 Even politicians can't get away with that.

84
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,420
 However, which is the consensus of the eyewitnesses?

85
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,920
 Which of the four would provide sufficient evidence, albeit circumstantial, in any court

86
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,560
 of law?

87
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:24,280
 Former U.S. Attorney General Joseph DeGenova has stated, "Circumstantial evidence is often

88
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,160
 stronger than eyewitness testimony because it's based on the facts.

89
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,960
 When you have footprints in the snow, it proves someone was there."

90
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,520
 The Roswell incident has produced hundreds of footprints, not in the snow, but rather

91
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,760
 in the desert soil of New Mexico.

92
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:53,360
 Sworn affidavits and a growing list of deathbed testimonies, confessions, all stating that

93
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,220
 the first press release about the recovery of the flying saucer was the correct one.

94
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,960
 As attorneys, you all know that deathbeds are admissible.

95
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,920
 If we were to dismiss the Roswell witnesses, then we would have to deny all such end-of-life

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,440
 declarations.

97
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,640
 There should be no discrimination just because we do not like their testimony.

98
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,360
 The proponents of a new theory and ideas are rightfully pressed for answers, yet whether

99
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,960
 one is able to offer evidence, either pro or con, should not be the issue.

100
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:37,600
 Another situation where after years of inquiry and investigation, there still remains questions.

101
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,840
 The mystery continues.

102
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,480
 That alone should generate further doubt and speculation.

103
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,920
 To do otherwise and persist in ignoring one of the most significant discoveries of all

104
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,560
 time may be one of the greatest mistakes in the history of humanity.

105
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,480
 To paraphrase Shakespeare's Hamlet, there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,

106
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
 than are in your dreams.

107
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
 Thank you.

108
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
 Thank you.

109
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:15,240
 Just for the record, would you give a little bit of your background, just briefly?

110
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,960
 My background, I worked for the U.S. Postal Service for about 25 years and I graduated

111
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,400
 cum laude from Concordia University in Wisconsin.

112
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,640
 I was a special investigator for the late Dr. J. Allen Heineck of the Center for UFO

113
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,200
 Studies in Chicago.

114
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,120
 I would become the center's director of special investigations for 10 years.

115
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,620
 I sat on their board of directors for 10 years.

116
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,440
 To date, we have interviewed over 600 witnesses, either directly or indirectly involved, which

117
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,520
 have provided us with an opportunity to write four bestselling books on the Roswell incident.

118
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,280
 The Roswell movie, which starred Cama Glocklin, Martin Sheen, Dwight Yoakam, was based on

119
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,000
 our first book, UFO Crash at Roswell.

120
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,640
 It's been quite an adventure, but I need emphasize to the panel that I was a complete skeptic.

121
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,400
 We thought we would make a single trip down to New Mexico and in a single weekend wrap

122
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,520
 this up, either coming away convinced that this was nothing more than a weather balloon

123
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,640
 or something else just as conventional.

124
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,800
 And upon speaking with first-hand witnesses, describing those very characteristics I mentioned

125
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,080
 of the material, of the wreckage, we realized that we needed to get back and continue tracking

126
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,560
 down as many witnesses as quickly as we could.

127
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,200
 We realized that we were potentially on one of the biggest stories of all time.

128
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,280
 Thank you for your passion and your commitment to what you've been doing.

129
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,000
 Thank you.

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,640
 Mr. Friedman, you're an old witness here, so you know the rules.

131
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,600
 I am the oldest witness here.

132
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,280
 You're not even close to us.

133
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
 Go ahead.

134
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:15,280
 You're right. I'd like to show the opticals, the visuals that I supplied, just to go through

135
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,720
 them quickly, very quickly.

136
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,280
 Biggest study ever done for the United States Air Force, Project Blue Book Special Report

137
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,920
 14, 3,200 sightings never referred to by the debunkers.

138
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,240
 The next one, please.

139
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,200
 Symposium on Unidentified Flying Objects.

140
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,280
 Those are the hearings of July 29, 1968.

141
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,560
 I was the youngest then of the contributors to that.

142
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,480
 254 pages, well worth looking at.

143
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,360
 The next one, please, Dr. J. Allen Hynek's book.

144
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,280
 He was only the Air Force Project Blue Book consultant for 20 years and chairman of the

145
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,080
 Department of Astronomy at Northwestern.

146
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,120
 You'd think when astronomers take wax at UFOs, they would at least look at Allen's book,

147
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,800
 but they don't.

148
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:18,400
 The next one, there's the University of Colorado study, 965 pages, $539,000 it cost us.

149
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,200
 The press gave the vision that this proved there was nothing to flying saucers.

150
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:33,560
 A more careful look at the report shows that 30% of the 117 cases studied in detail could

151
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,480
 not be identified.

152
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,820
 You didn't hear that when the report came out.

153
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:45,520
 So let's get those out of the way and then we'll go on to my prepared testimony here.

154
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,560
 People have often asked me why I think aliens would want to visit Earth.

155
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,120
 I have noted many reasons.

156
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,080
 Graduate students doing their thesis research on a primitive society, mining of dense metals

157
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,760
 as we have the densest planet in the solar system, et cetera.

158
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,360
 But most important to me is that I consider all civilizations would be concerned about

159
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,860
 their own survival and security.

160
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,240
 That means keeping tabs on those primitive societies in the neighborhood that show signs

161
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,100
 of being able to bother them.

162
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,120
 By July 1947, it was clear to any aliens in the neighborhood that we have a primitive

163
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,680
 society whose major activity is tribal warfare and that soon, less than 100 years, which

164
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,520
 is nothing on a cosmic time scale, we would be able to visit aliens out there taking our

165
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,680
 brand of friendship, everybody else calls it hostility, the facts that demonstrate that

166
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,800
 our nuclear weapons, powerful rockets, and radar, the beginning of advanced electronics.

167
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,280
 Isn't it amazing that the only place in the world at that time where you could study all

168
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,920
 three of these was southeastern New Mexico, our first nuclear weapon was detonated at

169
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,240
 Trinity site, White Sands Missile Range, July 16th, 1945.

170
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,440
 White Sands is where we're testing captured German V2 rockets and some of our own.

171
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,200
 And that's where we had our best radar to track the rockets.

172
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,080
 Sometimes they went south instead of north.

173
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,560
 And of course, as it turns out, there were at least three flying saucer crashes in New

174
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
 Mexico.

175
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,920
 In early July 1947, there was a crash near the small town of Corona, less than 80 miles

176
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,000
 from Roswell Army Airfield and nearby Roswell.

177
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,080
 100 miles west, there was an unpublicized crash at about the same time, the Plains of

178
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,360
 Santa Augusta, new book coming out this year about that, not by me.

179
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 Book by Arthur Campbell.

180
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,440
 And there was a crash retrieval operation in Aztec, New Mexico in the Four Corners area

181
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,660
 March 1948.

182
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,680
 New book is available.

183
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,040
 I was the first to hear about the Corona crash, as discussed in my book, "Crash at Corona"

184
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,920
 with Don Belinner.

185
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
 Simple story.

186
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,920
 I began lecturing about flying saucers in 1967 while working as a nuclear physicist in

187
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,720
 industry for little companies such as GE, GM, Westinghouse, et cetera.

188
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,880
 In 1978, I was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to speak at Louisiana State University.

189
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,320
 I was at a TV station to do three interviews to promote my lecture that evening at LSU.

190
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,480
 I had done two of the interviews.

191
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,360
 The third reporter was nowhere to be found.

192
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,280
 The station manager knew I had other things to do, was giving me coffee, looking at his

193
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
 watch.

194
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,400
 He was embarrassed, but he wanted to keep me there for that third interview.

195
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,760
 Out of the blue, he said, "The guy you really ought to talk to is Jesse Marcel."

196
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,720
 He handled the wreckage of one of those saucers when he was in the military and practically

197
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
 dropped my teeth.

198
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
 What do you know about him?

199
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
 He lives in Houma.

200
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,600
 That didn't tell me anything, because I didn't know where Houma was.

201
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,160
 It's a big city in Louisiana.

202
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,880
 I did visit there later to speak to Jesse.

203
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,520
 We are ham radio buddies, he told me, the station manager.

204
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,040
 You should talk to him.

205
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,840
 Okay, the third reporter, I've heard lots of stories, and you've sort of put it in your

206
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
 gray basket.

207
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,560
 We'll see what we can do.

208
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,880
 There was a great crowd the next day, that night, and the next day I was at the airport

209
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,220
 early, called information, got a number for Jesse Marcel, and called him.

210
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,880
 He told me his story.

211
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,500
 As I found out later, he couldn't deny his involvement, as his name was in papers across

212
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 the country.

213
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,440
 I didn't know it when I called him.

214
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,960
 People said, "Why did he talk to you?"

215
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,720
 Well, he didn't have a choice.

216
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,760
 He had to talk to somebody, because he couldn't lie about it, when it was public record.

217
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,400
 Soon thereafter, I heard about the Plains of San Agustin crash, after a lecture in Bemidji,

218
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
 Minnesota.

219
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,400
 I shared both stories with an old colleague from Pittsburgh, Bill Moore, who lived in

220
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
 Minnesota.

221
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,960
 He had a third story, from the Flying Saucer Review in the UK, which is still being published,

222
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,960
 which is rather amazing, that it's gone on this long.

223
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,080
 An English actor named Huey Green had noted that he heard about a crash saucer in New

224
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,480
 Mexico, when driving from Los Angeles to Philadelphia.

225
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,720
 The date was recalled as early July, 1947.

226
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,280
 That was not a trip you made very often back then.

227
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,200
 You can imagine what the roads were like at that time.

228
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,320
 Bill went to the University of Minnesota library, looked at the newspaper department, found

229
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,440
 the story, verifying what I'd been told, giving us new names.

230
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,440
 The next year and a half, we found 62 people, in conjunction with that case.

231
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,160
 That went up to 92, a few years later.

232
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,600
 These guys have had, I don't know, how many hundreds since then.

233
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:02,080
 Remember, we're talking about the most elite military group in the world.

234
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,480
 I got lucky.

235
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,160
 I called the Roswell Daily Record, which I hadn't known existed before that, looked

236
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,120
 in Editor and Publisher.

237
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,680
 I mentioned that I had some articles noting a crash of a saucer, as reported by a Walter

238
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,480
 Holt, Hout, it's spelled four different ways.

239
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,040
 I was shocked to be told, before I could finish the sentence, "Oh, his wife works here."

240
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,120
 Boy, talk about serendipity.

241
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
 How lucky can you get?

242
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,960
 I talked to the wife, talked to Walter.

243
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,840
 He was a big help to all of us in our research on Roswell, well thought of throughout the

244
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,320
 Roswell community.

245
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,900
 I found the son of the rancher.

246
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,080
 Telephone operators were nice then.

247
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,160
 I said, "I'd like to find anybody named Brazel."

248
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,360
 What city?

249
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,920
 I don't know.

250
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,560
 Southeastern New Mexico.

251
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,280
 She said, "Oh, I've got a William Brazel in Carrizozo."

252
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,680
 Is that in Southeastern New Mexico?

253
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,240
 Yes, okay, let's take it.

254
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,800
 He had just gotten his phone two weeks before.

255
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,640
 How lucky can you get, I guess?

256
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,920
 One I planned, one of the people that shows up in a key picture that got very wide distribution

257
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:22,320
 is at that time Colonel Thomas Jefferson Dubose, Chief of Staff to General Roger Raimi, head

258
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,200
 of the Eighth Air Force, which is where the 509th was.

259
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,760
 This is in Fort Worth, Texas.

260
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,240
 I checked with West Point, son of a gun, he was still alive.

261
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,200
 He was in his 80s.

262
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,680
 He was very forthcoming when I went to visit him, and Don and I went down there and we

263
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
 have it on tape.

264
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:47,000
 I've got a DVD out there, our interview with General, retired General Dubose.

265
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:57,600
 You don't often get a chance to talk to a general about something this important.

266
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,840
 Several of us here will be speaking at the Roswell Festival, which is early July.

267
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,120
 Much of the early Roswell research, I better stress, was done before the internet.

268
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,920
 It was hard work finding people.

269
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,040
 You called information, hoped they knew something, and so forth.

270
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:24,800
 You're very lucky that today a key witness is right here, Colonel Jesse A. Marcel Jr.,

271
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,320
 a medical doctor, called back in the Army at age 68 to fight in Iraq, flew over 200

272
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,200
 combat hours as a flight surgeon in helicopters.

273
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:43,120
 His father was Major Jesse Marcel, and he also handled wreckage in 1947.

274
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,920
 There are many Roswell debunkers who do their research by proclamation, not investigation.

275
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,840
 Their motto is, "Don't bother me with the facts, my mind is made up.

276
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
 If the public doesn't know, I won't tell them."

277
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,480
 We've all found these people.

278
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,780
 As a physicist, I want facts, not fantasy.

279
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,840
 So I am most grateful for this opportunity to be here.

280
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,840
 Thank you very much.

281
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:16,080
 Our next witness is also a military officer.

282
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,360
 I'd like to just point out one thing that came up several days in the earlier hearings,

283
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,660
 and that was the fact that non-disclosure agreements were proffered, and many people

284
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,640
 were forced into signing these non-disclosure agreements.

285
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,400
 You take an oath when you go into the military, to the Constitution, not to the President,

286
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,640
 not to a general, not to an admiral.

287
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,700
 You take it to the Constitution to defend the country, and many times you have better

288
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,560
 judgment on what is defending the country than many of our leaders.

289
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,400
 So Colonel, with that caveat, I want you to come forward.

290
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,720
 First of all, let me point out that I prepared a document last night for you all that deals

291
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,940
 with Project Blue Book and how it was orchestrated to be closed by the military.

292
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:12,780
 It was a planned operation to end Project Blue Book completely, and that was circulated

293
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,920
 I think this morning.

294
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,080
 My name is Kevin Randall, and I'm a retired Lieutenant Colonel with more than 20 years

295
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,440
 of service with the Army, the Air Force, and the National Guard.

296
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,560
 I served on active duty as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and as an intelligence officer

297
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
 in Iraq.

298
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,320
 I served on both active duty and in the active reserve with the Air Force and ended my military

299
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,080
 career as the provost marshal in the Iowa National Guard.

300
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,280
 I have published more than 20 books about UFOs, starting with the UFO case book in 1989

301
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,480
 and currently ending with alien mysteries, conspiracies, and cover-ups just this last

302
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
 month.

303
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,400
 I've been working on a book about what can be found in the government files about UFOs

304
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,480
 for the last several months.

305
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,960
 In 1988, I was at a science fiction convention and participated in a debate about UFOs with

306
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,600
 some of the top science fiction writers in the world.

307
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,580
 These included Frederick Pohl and I believe George R.R. Martin, who I mention here today

308
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,560
 just because of his success in recent months.

309
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,480
 When it was over, Don Schmidt talked to me about the Roswell UFO crash and said that

310
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,120
 the Center for UFO Studies was beginning some research into it.

311
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,600
 He thought my military background might be a benefit because many of the witnesses were

312
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,720
 retired military, and of course many of the witnesses had been members of the military

313
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,800
 at the time of the events.

314
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,640
 One of the first things I noticed was that Colonel Thomas Dubose had been identified

315
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,280
 as General Roger Ramey's aide, but brigadier generals don't have a full colonel as an aide.

316
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,800
 Dubose was the chief of staff, a much more important position.

317
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,520
 Dubose would later provide some very interesting testimony about what had been seen and done,

318
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,640
 including transferring the Roswell debris to SAC headquarters in Washington, D.C. at

319
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,080
 the time, all documented on videotape.

320
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,280
 We made our first trip to Roswell in February 1989.

321
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,200
 We started in Albuquerque and had a meeting with Frank Joyce, but when we arrived, Joyce

322
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,120
 begged off saying that he was ill.

323
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,720
 We met with a group of UFO researchers in Albuquerque, but they turned out to be a group

324
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,360
 of people more interested in the New Age phenomenon and not exactly UFO researchers.

325
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,480
 At any rate, they had nothing of interest for us and they had no insights into the Roswell

326
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,860
 case.

327
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,660
 We headed to Roswell and met with Cliff Stone.

328
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,400
 He knew a great deal about UFOs, but was unable to shed any insights into the Roswell case

329
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,920
 other than the crash site was beyond twin windmills.

330
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,560
 We thought this might be a really good clue until we saw how many twin windmills there

331
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,960
 were in New Mexico.

332
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,120
 Our last interview was with Bill Brazel, son of Mack, who had found the debris.

333
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,640
 I didn't hold out much hope for this, but when we met with him in Carrizoza, New Mexico,

334
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,880
 he was able to provide us with some very interesting information.

335
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,040
 We chatted for a few minutes and then Brazel said to us, "My dad found this thing," and

336
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,840
 we were off.

337
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,320
 Bill told us what had happened to his father Mack, how he had been held at the base in

338
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,520
 Roswell for a number of days, how he'd been asked not to talk about it.

339
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,640
 I suppose you could say he was sworn to secrecy, though there didn't seem to be any threats

340
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,200
 made to him and no documents signed.

341
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,760
 Mack didn't even tell his son Bill much about what he had seen.

342
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,440
 Bill told us that he was out on the ranch in the next couple of years where the object

343
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,240
 had crashed, or at least touched down briefly, where his dad had found this debris.

344
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,880
 He would look for some of it.

345
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,600
 He described for us on audio tape three items that he found over the years, a piece of wood-like

346
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,000
 material that was so tough he couldn't get a sliver on it when he tried to carving on

347
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,600
 it with his pocket knife, which he said he used to cut barbed wire.

348
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,960
 He said it was also that it was very lightweight, it was brown, it seemed to be like balsa wood.

349
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,780
 He found a bit of wire that he said you could shine a light into one end and it would come

350
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,440
 out the other, which of course is fiber optics.

351
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,480
 And he had a piece of foil, the famous foil, that could be crushed into a ball and then

352
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,760
 unfold itself without a sign of a wrinkle or a crease.

353
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,960
 Bill showed it to his father who said, "That looks like some of the contraption I found."

354
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,040
 At this point we realized that there was more than a misidentified weather balloon as the

355
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,840
 Air Force had suggested in 1947.

356
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,600
 It was clear from the descriptions of the material that Brazel himself had held, which

357
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,040
 he described for us was not something that had been manufactured on Earth.

358
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,640
 We knew that there was a lot more work to be done.

359
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,400
 I located former major, later retired Colonel, Edwin Easley, who was a provost marshal in

360
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,720
 the base in 1947.

361
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,840
 The provost marshal is similar to the chief of police in a city, but a provost marshal

362
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,320
 also has a number of other duties revolving around security.

363
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,640
 Easley, because this was an atomic strike force, had a greater responsibility of officers

364
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,160
 of a similar grade at other military installations.

365
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,360
 He told me on audio tape several times that he'd been sworn to secrecy.

366
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,120
 Finally, somewhat exasperated with my questions, he said, "I can't talk about it.

367
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,640
 I promised the president that I wouldn't."

368
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,640
 Now, I don't know if he talked to President Truman personally or a representative of the

369
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,760
 president, which is about the same thing, but whatever the circumstance, he believed

370
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,320
 he'd promised the president he wouldn't talk about it.

371
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,440
 Skeptics ask, "Would the president talk to a major?"

372
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,480
 And I say, "An obscure lieutenant colonel talked to the president, and the Doolittle

373
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,160
 raid was born."

374
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,840
 Easley confirmed that Brazel had been held on the base for several days.

375
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,860
 He said that Brazel was held in the guest house, which is not exactly jail.

376
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,860
 But if you have a guard on the door and you're not allowed to leave, it really doesn't matter

377
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,880
 how comfortable the quarters are, it still qualifies as a jail.

378
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,840
 I will note that we can prove Brazel was in Roswell after he first reported the find based

379
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,080
 on the documentation we have.

380
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,240
 Neighbors tell us he complained to them about being held there.

381
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,960
 Marion Strickland, one of the neighbors, said on videotape that Brazel had been gone for

382
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,880
 several days and he was mad about it.

383
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,640
 So Easley confirmed part of the story for us.

384
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,740
 Easley was also asked by me if the craft was extraterrestrial.

385
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,320
 What happened precisely is that I asked him if we were following the right path.

386
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,880
 He said, "What do you mean?"

387
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,680
 I said, "We think it was extraterrestrial," and he said, "Well, that's not the wrong path."

388
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,000
 Every member of Colonel Blanchard's staff, Blanchard being the commanding officer at

389
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Roswell at the time, and who later was in line to be chief of staff at the Air Force,

390
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,840
 gave us a variation of that.

391
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,120
 Major Jesse Marcel Sr., an Air Force intelligence officer at the time, said on videotape, "It

392
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,560
 seems that it was something that came to Earth, but it was not something made on Earth."

393
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,240
 Let me say here that the skeptics have attempted to slander the memory of Blanchard by suggesting

394
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,020
 he was a loose cannon, which explains his handling of the discovery and the press release

395
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,520
 that he ordered issued.

396
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,920
 But his ratings not long after the Roswell crash by his superior officers, he was rated

397
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,520
 quite high and there was nothing mentioned about the Roswell case.

398
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,080
 A loose cannon is not promoted to general and is not destined to be the chief of staff.

399
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,440
 Major Patrick Saunders, the base adjutant, who wouldn't talk much about the Roswell case

400
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,800
 when I interviewed him, did leave some documentation for us.

401
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,480
 He wrote on the flyleaf to the book, "UFO Crash at Roswell," "Here's the truth, and

402
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,000
 I still haven't told anybody anything," and he signed it pat.

403
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,400
 This page is called Damage Control, and it tells that files were altered, that they changed

404
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,120
 personnel records and the code words, and that the bodies and the craft were removed

405
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,420
 from Roswell.

406
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,320
 In a letter to his daughter, which he kindly sent to me, Saunders talked about how they

407
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,480
 had successfully hid the paper trail.

408
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,160
 Walter Hott, the man who wrote the press release announcing that they had captured a flying

409
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:05,920
 saucer, signed an affidavit about what he had seen, which included craft and bodies.

410
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:11,520
 Hott said that in his position as PIO, that he often operated as Colonel Blanchard's aid

411
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,720
 to camp, a colonel not being authorized in aid.

412
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,320
 There's been some controversy about Hott's statement because for 20 years that I knew

413
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,260
 him, he had always said that he just wrote the press release.

414
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,280
 He didn't know anything beyond that.

415
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,700
 He didn't see anything beyond that.

416
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,680
 Then in the affidavit signed and released after his death, he said that he had seen

417
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
 the bodies.

418
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,160
 There was a direct contradiction of what he had claimed.

419
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,640
 Ten years before that, I interviewed a fellow named Richard Harris.

420
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,600
 He was a finance officer at the Roswell Army Airfield, and he helped Patrick Saunders bury

421
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
 the expenditure of money.

422
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,880
 Let me digress here for just a moment.

423
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,320
 Everything has to be paid for by the military, or in the military, and all expenditures must

424
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,100
 be accounted for.

425
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,760
 You can't send an aircraft on a training flight, for example, without naming a funding

426
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,920
 source for that flight.

427
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,080
 Of course, you can have a cross-country training flight from Roswell to Wright Field in Dayton,

428
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,660
 Ohio, a perfectly legitimate expense, and you can always put the records of an alien

429
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,840
 craft or the bodies on the flight without having to note it.

430
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,420
 The flight is paid for out of the training budget, and there is no need to mention the

431
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,640
 genesis of the mission, which is to take the stuff to Ohio.

432
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,880
 So Harris confirmed some of what Saunders had said, but more importantly, he told me

433
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,940
 that he'd seen the bodies, or he had almost seen the bodies.

434
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,240
 According to Harris, he was in a hangar where the bodies were temporarily located, and Haught

435
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,160
 asked him if he wanted to see them.

436
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,760
 Harris said that he put his hand on the door knob, but he didn't turn it.

437
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,880
 This stunned me, given the chance I would have opened the door, but that's today in

438
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,740
 1947.

439
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,280
 Harris said that he didn't want to see that.

440
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,280
 But it confirms to an extent what Walter Haught said about seeing the bodies, and as I say,

441
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,760
 Harris told me this 10 years before Walter Haught mentioned anything like that.

442
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,760
 Now I have noticed I have just a minute left, and I had some interesting things I wanted

443
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,800
 to cover, but let me just say this.

444
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,320
 The Air Force claimed this was Project Mogul.

445
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,280
 The documentation suggests it was flight number four, but when we look at the diary created

446
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,800
 by Dr. Albert Crary, who is the leader of the project, he said flight number four had

447
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,860
 been canceled.

448
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,000
 There was no flight number four.

449
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,460
 There is a note that says that they had made it some kind of a test flight, but it's not

450
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,240
 part of the official record of the project in New Mexico.

451
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,240
 Mogul, by the way, was not highly classified.

452
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,560
 The equipment was off the shelf.

453
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,600
 What they were doing in New Mexico was published in the newspapers, and worse still, according

454
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,640
 to the documentation, these flights had to be announced in the FAA notums.

455
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,960
 These notices to airmen were items that could affect aerial navigation.

456
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,560
 An array of balloons, some 600 feet long, drifting along at tens of thousands of feet

457
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,960
 fit that definition.

458
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,680
 Moore was aware of that in 1995, wrote that they had not contacted the FAA because they

459
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:18,200
 didn't expect this mythical flight number four to leave the restricted area.

460
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,440
 I wanted to mention one final thing, and I see my time has expired.

461
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,000
 But on July 8th, they made the press release.

462
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:34,800
 On July 9th, according to the newspapers, the United Press reported, "Report to flying

463
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,760
 saucers whizzing through the sky fell off sharply today as the Army and the Navy began

464
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,520
 a concentrated campaign to stop the rumors."

465
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,960
 The question is, what happened to make them stop on July 9th when they had published everything

466
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
 else?

467
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:55,520
 I will say this, in 1947, the Air Force said what fell at Roswell was a weather balloon.

468
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,320
 When they made their investigation in the mid-1990s, they said they lied about this.

469
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,220
 It wasn't a weather balloon, it was a weather balloon.

470
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,280
 They just changed the name, it counted a cluster of balloons, it was nothing special about

471
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,120
 them, they were just weather balloons tethered together in a long train, but it did not answer

472
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,240
 the question.

473
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,020
 Why did the service members at Roswell fail to identify it as such?

474
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,520
 Why could they not identify a weather balloon, no matter what name you apply to it?

475
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,000
 Thank you very much.

476
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,520
 Thank you.

477
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,880
 And thank you for the brevity of your statements thus far.

478
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:37,760
 I want to clear up something, because we've got three Marcells there, and we're talking

479
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,080
 about your father, who was a major intelligence officer, is that correct?

480
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
 Yes.

481
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:51,160
 You're a colonel in the Army, that was a medical doctor in addition to that, and then you've

482
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:59,840
 got your son, you would be Marcell number two, he's Marcell number three, okay?

483
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:05,200
 And your position at this point, and then we've got Denise, who I presume is your wife?

484
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
 Sister.

485
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,400
 Sister, okay, so we've got the whole family here, and we're going to get testimony from

486
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
 all of you.

487
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,280
 We appreciate that, and so Colonel, please proceed.

488
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
 Yes, sir.

489
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:22,160
 I'm the son of Major Jesse Marcell, who was the intelligence officer for the 509th Composite

490
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,520
 Bomb Group based out of Roswell Army Airfield in 1947.

491
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,280
 The 509th, as you may recall, was the squadron who entered the war with the atomic bombing

492
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,520
 of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

493
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,640
 My dad's credentials obviously were very impressive.

494
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,080
 In the course of his career, he was not only one of the few officers selected for the 509th,

495
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,560
 but he also went to radar school and also was a staff member of the Air Force intelligence

496
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,760
 officer.

497
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,980
 The radar school was important because in that he would have been very familiar with

498
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:01,120
 all kinds of weather balloons and radar targets and the paraphernalia associated with this

499
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,360
 kind of a device, you know, weather balloon or mogul balloon, but a balloon is still a

500
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:11,680
 balloon with off-the-shelf material.

501
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,680
 I myself followed a career in medicine, graduating from the LSU School of Medicine in 1961, and

502
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,960
 I joined the military shortly after my graduation and internship.

503
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,200
 My first taste of the military was being stationed aboard the USS Renville, which is a troop

504
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,920
 transport ship destined for Cuba.

505
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,400
 We spent several weeks sitting around in circles south of Cuba in preparation for the invasion,

506
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,360
 which fortunately never happened, or else I wouldn't be here.

507
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,600
 Yeah, really.

508
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:56,040
 And I ended my career as an Army colonel in December 2005 after a 13-month tour in Iraq

509
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,120
 where I gained 200 hours of combat flying and, you know, things like that, just having fun

510
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,520
 out there really.

511
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:14,320
 I did not come home entirely unscathed, however, I got severe PTSD from all the rigor, and

512
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,040
 also I developed a weakness in my legs that they think is related to some sort of toxic

513
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,880
 contamination that I became exposed to in Iraq, but that's neither here nor there.

514
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,760
 And my story for the Roswell part began in the wee hours in the morning of July 1947,

515
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,200
 when I was awakened by my dad who was returning from an assignment to collect debris of unknown

516
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,640
 origin from a ranch out of Roswell.

517
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,740
 This is the Foster Ranch and this is the debris that Mack Brazel had run across.

518
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:51,040
 Apparently the rancher, by the name of Mack Brazel, notified the local sheriff of Chavez

519
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,200
 County of the downing of some sort of aircraft on his land.

520
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,640
 He was not quite sure what the nature of this was.

521
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,280
 He'd seen weather balloons, you know, go down there before, so he was not sure it was that

522
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,560
 either, but it was something very different.

523
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,640
 The sheriff in Chavez County contacted Colonel Blanchard, who was the commander of the Air

524
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,200
 Force Base in Roswell.

525
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,720
 Now Colonel Blanchard knew my dad was the intelligence officer, so he dispatched my

526
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:26,240
 dad and a CIC agent, Sheridan Cavill, to investigate what this was, whether it was one of our planes

527
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,640
 or just whatever, just an unknown crash site.

528
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,240
 So it was their job to go ahead and ascertain what was out there and bring representative

529
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,120
 portions of this back to the base so they could study it to determine, make a final

530
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,920
 determination of this.

531
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:49,160
 As it turns out, our house happened to be on the way to the base, and this is in the

532
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,160
 wee hours of the morning.

533
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,200
 So my dad, knowing that he had seen something very special, wanted my mother and myself

534
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,480
 to look at this also, because as he said, you'll never see this again.

535
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,880
 So what he did, he stopped off at the house, awakened my mother and myself, and again the

536
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,880
 wee hours of the morning, it was summertime, I'd been playing all day with my bicycles

537
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,440
 and things like that.

538
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,640
 I was 11 years old at the time, however, and he brought us into the kitchen and saw a smattering

539
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,400
 of this strange debris on the kitchen floor that he had prepositioned.

540
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,600
 He said, "Look at this.

541
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,480
 I think this is what you call a flying saucer or remains thereof."

542
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,360
 I was not quite sure what a flying saucer was at that time, because I was more interested

543
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,000
 in bicycling and using my 22 rifle for practice.

544
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,080
 But at any rate, the first thing he wanted us to do, or me particularly, was to check

545
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,960
 the debris out, make sure there was no electronic components there, looking for vacuum tubes,

546
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,880
 resistors, condensers, and things like that.

547
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:03,400
 But there wasn't any, and he already knew that, but he wanted me to satisfy my own curiosity

548
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,280
 as is.

549
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,400
 The debris itself consisted of three components, three types.

550
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:15,640
 There was a foil, a very tough metallic foil of some nature that I can't really describe.

551
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:22,440
 I had to add that I did not see the bending and unbending of it, but my dad witnessed

552
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
 it.

553
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,520
 He said if you folded over, it'd unfold and assume its original form.

554
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,180
 In addition, there was a black plastic debris, like a broken phonograph record.

555
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,160
 But the strangest thing I saw as being passed around right now was that this is a replica

556
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,720
 of one of the I-beams, or the beams I saw in the wreckage.

557
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,560
 In that, you'll note there's some symbols written along the inside surface of this,

558
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,940
 and they're a purplish-violet hue, semi-reflective of light.

559
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,000
 But this is basically what this was.

560
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,480
 Is this a replica?

561
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
 Yes, sir.

562
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
 This is a replica.

563
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,240
 If it was original, I wouldn't have it.

564
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,600
 Well, you never know, that's why we're asking.

565
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,900
 That's right.

566
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:14,320
 But anyway, my dad drove the debris into the base that night, I think it was that night

567
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:21,080
 or maybe early next morning, where he was assigned by Colonel Blanchard to fly the material

568
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,280
 to General Ramey's office in Fort Worth.

569
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,120
 This was flown in the belly of a B-29 under armed guard.

570
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:37,760
 So I then saw a picture of my dad taken in General Ramey's office, holding what was obviously

571
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
 a radar target.

572
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,120
 They had already switched the debris.

573
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,600
 And the look on his face is quite telling, he says, "You've got to be kidding me.

574
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,240
 This is not what I saw, and this is not what I saw either."

575
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,920
 But anyway, that's where the cover began, in General Ramey's office.

576
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,200
 So when my dad got home, he sat my mother and myself down and said in no uncertain terms,

577
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,920
 "You will never talk about this.

578
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,960
 This is a non-event."

579
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,000
 And yes, sir, I was normally a brat, so I was following orders.

580
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,160
 So I never discussed this with my friends or anybody else until after Stan Friedman

581
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,840
 interviewed my dad in 1978.

582
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,520
 Great.

583
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:21,760
 Thank you very much.

584
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,000
 Let me reemphasize, as a military officer, you took an oath to the Constitution, not

585
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,560
 to General Ramey or to anybody else.

586
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,760
 It's the Constitution.

587
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,960
 We move now to your son, Jesse, the third.

588
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,760
 The third, yep.

589
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
 Marcel.

590
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
 Marcel is a French name?

591
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
 Marcel?

592
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,400
 Thank you to the distinguished members of the committee.

593
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,680
 I am here today not to speak as an expert witness to what I have heard and researched

594
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,280
 about Roswell, but simply to help you get to know two great men, my grandfather, Major

595
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,480
 Jesse Marcel Sr., and my father, Dr. Jesse Marcel.

596
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,480
 My grandfather was a simple man who just wanted to lead a simple life.

597
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,000
 Closer to the mic, please.

598
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Sorry.

599
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,720
 I could restate that.

600
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,840
 My grandfather was a simple man who just wanted to lead a simple life, starting at a very

601
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,920
 early age when he wasn't helping the family with the farm.

602
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,280
 He would sneak away to find parts to build radios.

603
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,120
 Later in his life, before entering the war, he would use his skills to build a ham radio

604
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,880
 that would become a Lafayette Passion.

605
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,960
 He would spend endless hours chatting with people from around the world.

606
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,880
 Things would change rapidly as we were pulled into the Second World War.

607
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,840
 On his own accord, he went from his job as a civilian draftsman to joining the war effort

608
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,480
 where he excelled in his duties from the very beginning.

609
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,120
 His superiors recognized his aptitude towards problem-solving and sent him to an intelligence

610
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
 school.

611
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:53,320
 Again, he excelled in his courses and was asked to teach the next incoming class.

612
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,640
 He would eventually end up in the Roswell Air Force Base working in our nuclear bombing

613
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,680
 program with the 519th Composite.

614
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,040
 With the war over and a life returning to a sense of normalcy, Grandpa would receive

615
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,200
 a simple order, an order that would change his and most of our lives forever.

616
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,920
 The heavens would open up and send us a visitor that would establish the words "alien" and

617
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,120
 "flying saucer" in the English vernacular, and it was him they sent to investigate.

618
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,360
 Decades later, my father followed in Grandpa's footsteps as a military man serving the Navy

619
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,000
 to train to be a medical doctor.

620
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,240
 Soon after, he would settle down in Clancy, Montana to raise a family and continue in

621
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,080
 the reserves to become a helicopter pilot.

622
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,120
 As the only NT, I remember as a child going with my father on his rounds, not the ones

623
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,920
 at the hospital, but the ones where he would visit his parents in their homes.

624
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,840
 He would carry in his little black bag and take care of his patients in the same caring

625
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,880
 way he would take care of the rest of us.

626
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,880
 Back in the office, if a child showed up in ratty shoes to his appointment, a new pair

627
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,680
 would be waiting for him on their next visit.

628
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,120
 I remember very fondly watching him not only build a oscilloscope, but his design and construction

629
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,120
 of a computer guidance system for the oscilloscope long before there was such a thing, at least

630
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,720
 on an amateur level.

631
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,800
 He would spend endless hours wrapping small green glass switches that would eventually

632
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,880
 become the brain.

633
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,240
 In the summer, we would all pile into a van, RV or whatever form of transportation that

634
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,400
 we'd have available to us and head to home Louisiana, where my grandparents had lived

635
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,040
 or had returned to live out the rest of their lives.

636
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,640
 I remember so clearly driving down a shell-covered road leading out to their house with the most

637
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,700
 notable feature being a huge greenhouse that easily equaled the size of their residence

638
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,640
 that my grandfather lovingly built for his wife, Vio.

639
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,820
 My grandmother had a green thumb like no other.

640
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:43,240
 My father would send her a tomato plant that would barely survive the short Montana summers

641
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,580
 into immense vegetation that would reach the floor to ceiling.

642
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,920
 Each morning, my grandfather would lead me to his shop, occupying a space in the house

643
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
 in the garage.

644
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,160
 He'd reach up into the rafters and pull down fishing poles that had been there for decades.

645
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,720
 These poles were not made of fiberglass, but of bamboo, very simple, but effective in their

646
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
 trade.

647
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,920
 I recall leaning against a table saw in his workshop, watching him attach the reel with

648
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,200
 the hand that was missing a digit from some long ago battle with that same table saw.

649
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,960
 He would add the weights and the bobber from two rusty old tackle boxes and finish the

650
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,000
 session off by showing me how to delicately hook the worm without injuring myself.

651
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,080
 All this was not always the case.

652
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,680
 We'd make our way to the back door and out on his lawn that ran up against a bayou.

653
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,000
 After a couple of casts, we could sit back and talk and enjoy each other's company.

654
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,360
 My grandfather's other great obsessions were sports.

655
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,080
 LSU provided the teams that he most favored and occupied his weekend TV viewing hours.

656
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:40,840
 I'll always remember grandpa as a gentle giant who somehow lived the life of a southern gentleman

657
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,600
 who would be at least partially responsible for change in the way people of our world

658
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,360
 would look into the night skies, and think to themselves, "Maybe, just maybe, somebody

659
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,360
 was looking back."

660
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,760
 Today, I share these same stories I learned as a child with my own kids, rousal as a new

661
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,560
 type of conversation between the kids and their teachers in elementary school.

662
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,340
 The legacy will go on.

663
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,340
 Thank you.

664
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,520
 Thank you very much.

665
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,520
 And now for your sister.

666
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,400
 Well, first of all, I also want to thank the committee for taking the time to listen to

667
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,560
 our family's history.

668
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,160
 My name is Denise Marcel.

669
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,480
 I am the granddaughter of Major Jesse Marcel, Sr., and the daughter of retired Colonel Dr.

670
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,920
 Marcel, Jr.

671
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,700
 My grandfather was the first military officer at a UFO crash site in Roswell, New Mexico.

672
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,980
 While there, he collected some of the crash site debris.

673
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:35,480
 He was so amazed by the characteristics of the debris, he decided he had to show my father

674
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,080
 and grandmother.

675
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,780
 And whatever it was that they had seen, it has had a great impact on our family.

676
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,800
 When we moved to Clancy, Montana in the early '70s, my father built a telescope in our backyard.

677
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,360
 Now, this wasn't one of your average, ordinary telescopes.

678
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,080
 To start, he dug a hole in our backyard the size of a small room.

679
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,820
 For months, I remember my mother and us kids helping him polish this very large mirror.

680
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,480
 From there, he began constructing the telescope, including building a rotating dome.

681
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,120
 This was a telescope that was later loaned to the Helena Astronomy Association.

682
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,440
 And he had built this from top to bottom.

683
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,300
 My dad was a man who had witnessed something.

684
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,860
 This was a man who was driven.

685
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,220
 That telescope opened up a whole new world for our family.

686
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:24,220
 It was around the age of nine that I first became aware of UFOs, not only because of

687
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:28,700
 the telescope, but also because there were times my father and us kids would camp out

688
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,320
 at night specifically looking for movement in the skies hoping to catch a glimpse of

689
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,980
 a UFO.

690
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,520
 One has to remember, we didn't have the Internet then, and UFOs were not discussed like they

691
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
 are today.

692
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,220
 I do not think that my parents would lead us to believe at such a young age that UFOs

693
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:49,640
 existed if my father and grandfather had not witnessed something extraordinary.

694
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,740
 In January of 1997, I accompanied my father and Kent Jeffreys to Washington, D.C. for

695
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,700
 a hypnosis session that Dr. Neil Hibbler would conduct over the course of three days.

696
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,380
 Dr. Hibbler was one of the world's leading experts who used hypnotic regressions for

697
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,420
 forensic purposes.

698
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:14,580
 I had been very fortunate to be able to participate because I had just been certified as a hypnotherapist.

699
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,680
 The sessions were successful.

700
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,580
 While under hypnosis, my father said he couldn't believe how vividly he could see his dad.

701
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,880
 I saw the emotion in his face and how it touched his heart seeing his father so clearly that

702
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,240
 day.

703
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,060
 During the sessions, my father recalls being woken up by my grandfather telling him to

704
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,900
 come and look at a piece of a flying saucer, a term in which most people, including himself,

705
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,640
 was not familiar with.

706
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,580
 When asked about the materials, my father's descriptions did not waver from what he had

707
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:45,540
 been describing throughout the years.

708
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,980
 One of the more interesting facets of the debris descriptions are the symbols or hieroglyphics

709
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,660
 that my father had seen on the eye beam.

710
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,540
 While under hypnosis, the facts remain the same.

711
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,980
 Just like when he was a child, he motioned grabbing the eye beam and holding it above

712
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,780
 his head to get a better look at the purple reflecting symbols.

713
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,420
 The military claimed that these symbols were merely Christmas-wrapped tape, but it is very

714
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,780
 unlikely and does not seem possible that three people did not recognize simple holiday decorations

715
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,500
 on some Scotch tape.

716
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,140
 Another interesting fact my father recalled was that soon after the incident, his father

717
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,580
 told the family never to talk about it again, that it was a non-event.

718
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,380
 Now why would they have to remain silent about a weather or a blue night doesn't make any

719
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,380
 sense to me.

720
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,700
 It has been said that since my father did not remember anything new from those sessions

721
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:39,540
 and did not remember seeing any exotic debris, electronic components or anything that resembled

722
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:45,460
 motors which they were specifically looking for, this material could not have been from

723
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,220
 a UFO, that the material was just too mundane.

724
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,540
 I believe this argument works against itself because if it had been some radar device there

725
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:58,100
 should have been some very basic electronic components and it would have been mundane.

726
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,720
 Therefore my grandfather would never have brought it home to show his family.

727
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,540
 The only explanation that he brought this home was because he was very excited about

728
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,620
 what he had found.

729
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:12,100
 My grandfather and father were very dedicated military men and always followed through with

730
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,100
 their orders.

731
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,060
 They both remained silent to the public about the incident until my grandfather had been

732
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:21,620
 approached by Stanton Friedman nearly 30 years after the event.

733
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,540
 During interviews my grandfather was asked about the materials and he would say, "It

734
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:31,500
 was not anything from this earth that I am quite sure of."

735
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,100
 These words would change the course of the Marcel family.

736
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,040
 The reason he was ordered to go to the site was because he was an intelligence officer

737
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,460
 familiar with most all of the materials used in aircraft and travel.

738
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,500
 He was very qualified to make an assessment of the crash site debris.

739
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,860
 And for the record, my grandfather had nothing to gain when he spoke to Stanton Friedman.

740
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,860
 He just felt the same way that I do, that the world should know the truth.

741
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:00,420
 It has affected my family's life in so many good ways and some bad, but because of this

742
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,620
 I was also given the greatest gift of all and that is to have an open mind.

743
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:08,780
 I feel that sometimes agendas are put in front of our rights of being citizens and not everything

744
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,980
 that the government has told us is the truth.

745
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:17,460
 Because when it comes to the Roswell incident, I believe my grandfather and my father.

746
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:23,580
 Last and certainly not least, it is my hope that for my father, my grandfather and all

747
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:27,220
 of the other wonderful people who have found the courage to step up and tell the truth

748
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:32,300
 this week will be given the respect and recognition that they deserve.

749
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,300
 Thank you.

750
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:45,900
 I just want to say that the Marcel family has a very close friend and his name is Richard

751
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,900
 O'Connor.

752
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,900
 I don't know if you've seen what he's put forward to support you.

753
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,100
 So he's a friend of yours.

754
00:52:53,100 --> 00:53:01,540
 I want to now turn to, for the members' sake, we have seven minutes that we can delve into

755
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,860
 with these people.

756
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:10,700
 And I'll first turn to Merrill Cook to start the process.

757
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,460
 Yes, that's right.

758
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,140
 Thank you, Mr. Chair.

759
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,300
 Donald Schmidt, I'd like to start with you.

760
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:26,060
 You said that you went down to New Mexico with an idea of doing something in the fiction

761
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,060
 area.

762
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,180
 You weren't really much of a believer.

763
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,180
 No.

764
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,180
 No.

765
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,180
 But it changed your mind.

766
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,980
 That was Kevin Randall and myself, correct.

767
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,660
 And what changed your mind is you said you met with first-hand witnesses.

768
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,660
 Correct.

769
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,180
 I'd like to know what year that was.

770
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,140
 That was February of 1989.

771
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,140
 Okay.

772
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:51,860
 And could you tell me who those first-hand witnesses you met with?

773
00:53:51,860 --> 00:54:00,020
 Dr. Randall had mentioned specifically it was the son of W.W. Mack Brazzo, Bill Brazzo

774
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:07,660
 Jr., and we could also add his wife, Shirley, who were both first-hand witnesses to the

775
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,660
 material.

776
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,220
 So you talked to them on that occasion.

777
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:17,580
 We had the opportunity at that time and many times thereafter, including other members

778
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,740
 of the Brazzo family.

779
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:26,820
 What we could also point out is that Bill Jr., the son of the rancher, was fortunate

780
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:33,580
 enough to discover additional remnants from the crash.

781
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:39,060
 Months thereafter, especially after heavy rains, pieces washed the surface.

782
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:49,780
 Now bear in mind, we already had first-hand accounts that there were 50 to 60 troops at

783
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:57,020
 the debris field site for the course of two and a half to three days walking shoulder

784
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,380
 to shoulder with wheelbarrows, going to check sites.

785
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:10,220
 It required that much time to clear this site in contrast to a weather balloon, which would

786
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:14,500
 have taken all of them a few minutes for someone to toss over their shoulder, toss into the

787
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,740
 back of a pickup truck.

788
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,900
 I have almost no doubt that something crashed there, that there was a lot of pickup, and

789
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,940
 I just wonder exactly who it was you.

790
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,940
 You talked to me.

791
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,940
 You've answered that very well.

792
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:30,020
 We've got a lot of witnesses here that really want an opportunity to talk to up.

793
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:36,980
 Lieutenant Colonel Randall, you had talked about work you've done to show why Air Force

794
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:44,340
 Project Blue Book was, you used some rather negative language about it, and why it was

795
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,260
 just, a cover-up is what you said?

796
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:54,660
 What happened in, all during the 1960s, there is a series of letters you see in the Project

797
00:55:54,660 --> 00:56:00,300
 Blue Book files where they're requesting to get Project Blue Book out of A-Tech into the

798
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:06,940
 Secretary of the Air Force's Office of Information to de-emphasize the importance of Project

799
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,940
 Blue Book.

800
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,420
 Okay, now de-emphasizing the importance of Project Blue Book, that's not exactly the

801
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:16,900
 same thing, and that's, when I look at, I'm not trying to put any words in your mouth,

802
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:22,260
 but I've got to focus in on a question here, and that's when the University of Colorado

803
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:28,460
 was asked to help him make a decision about Project Blue Book, let's put it that way,

804
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,140
 and when the University of Colorado wrote a report, I think you're all correct in saying

805
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:39,100
 that what the report said wasn't exactly the way it was characterized even by the, certainly

806
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:44,660
 by the government, and even by, well, and by the media as well, but isn't it true that

807
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:50,500
 it didn't say anything about it all being nonsense, it just said we don't want to fund

808
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:55,940
 additional work on collection, collecting this data, that we are publishing to the world,

809
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:01,020
 I mean, there are 101 incidents published that we can read about from Project Blue Book,

810
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,020
 am I correct?

811
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,420
 What I'm asking is, you have absolutely no faith, and that's fine, in the National Science

812
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,780
 Foundation, is that what you're telling us?

813
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:18,740
 What I'm saying is that the outcome of the scientific investigation was preordained.

814
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,900
 There's a letter from Lieutenant Colonel Hippler to committee members at the Condon Committee

815
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,220
 at the University of Colorado saying, this is what we want you to find.

816
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:30,380
 They haven't investigated a case, they haven't looked at anything, but here's what we want

817
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,380
 you to find.

818
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,740
 You have to say something nice about the Air Force investigation, you have to say that

819
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,300
 it does not affect national security, and allow us to close it down, because if you

820
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,100
 don't do that, we're going to be stuck with this for another 20 years.

821
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:49,140
 So the University of Colorado pulled the wool over the National Science Foundation, folks,

822
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,860
 is that what you're telling us?

823
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,860
 Yes.

824
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:52,860
 During the investigation.

825
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:57,660
 They couldn't figure out that maybe there was influence from the Air Force on what Colorado

826
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,660
 was?

827
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,740
 They didn't care.

828
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,500
 The whole purpose of the Condon Committee was to end Project Blue Book and stop the Air

829
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,540
 Force investigation.

830
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:09,700
 During the Condon Committee's time in session, they were supposed to investigate cases that

831
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,700
 came up.

832
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,820
 There was a marvelous case from Shag Harbor, Canada, where something was photographed in

833
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,060
 the air, it was seen to hit the ground.

834
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:22,060
 The United States Navy responded, the Canadian military forces responded, and there's even

835
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,500
 evidence that the Russians responded.

836
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:30,180
 The Condon Committee's investigation was to make a phone call to Canada and say, oh, it's

837
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:34,340
 just a couple of teenagers who saw something strange, we're not going to bother with it.

838
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:39,700
 And I appreciate your answer, I'm going to move on, not because I don't want you to have

839
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:48,460
 more opportunity, but I'm so particularly interested in what Colonel Marcel, Dr. Colonel,

840
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:57,060
 and boy, you should be proud of these children and grandchildren of Jenny, Jesse Senior.

841
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:02,820
 You have done a wonderful job in establishing, you know, just that story about the fishing

842
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,820
 pole.

843
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:10,300
 And you're talking about an honest grandfather, I mean, you didn't have to even use that word,

844
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,980
 the way you described that, and to you too, Denise.

845
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:22,460
 And I'm very impressed with you, Jesse Marcel Jr., I mean, you're one of the very few witnesses

846
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:29,780
 that have actually held or seen or accompanied your father with something in your hand that

847
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:36,380
 came from this incident or an incident that, let me put it this way, somebody that's a

848
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,860
 friend of mine, somebody that I've listened to, somebody I already said I had respect

849
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:46,020
 for, a different party, but former Governor Bill Richardson has said to me and others

850
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:52,380
 with us in a discussion we had with him that everything you have said is honest.

851
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,320
 There's no question in his mind that that debris is there, it happened, and what you've

852
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,180
 said about your father and doing all that is absolutely true.

853
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:07,020
 What you've said to me here directly simply reinforces something I believe because I have

854
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,380
 a lot of faith in the integrity of the man I just mentioned, Bill Richardson.

855
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:18,700
 But I have to say this, I'm looking at you straight in the eyes here.

856
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:26,440
 I know that you believe that's from an extraterrestrial source, but can you say honestly to this committee

857
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,380
 that you know that for some reason or that there's something that you absolutely know

858
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,580
 that the government is hiding because Bill Richardson agrees with you that they should

859
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,660
 open the files, I agree with you, they should open those Roswell files.

860
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:45,660
 We should see exactly what might remain from whatever you and your father took over.

861
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:51,060
 So yeah, you give this committee a lot of reasons for us to say open those files.

862
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,620
 But I just want to hear an answer to the question I gave you.

863
01:00:54,620 --> 01:01:00,100
 Years ago I was called to Washington, I was going to a meeting, and there was a gentleman

864
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:06,140
 by the name of Dick DiMatto who wanted to interview me when I got to Washington.

865
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:11,980
 And he was in the Capitol building, Senate room 228 I believe if I remember right.

866
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,220
 But he said he wanted to talk to me about what I saw in Roswell.

867
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:20,660
 So I went up to the Capitol building, and very friendly, very nice gentleman.

868
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:25,660
 He says, you know, we want to talk about what you saw in Roswell.

869
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:30,340
 And he asked me, did I want to talk in a secure room?

870
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:34,740
 And I said, well, sir, I'm not going to say anything I haven't said publicly already.

871
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,220
 He says, but I might tell you something.

872
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:41,360
 And so we'll talk in a secure room.

873
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:48,320
 So we went down into the basements, several floors down below in the Capitol building,

874
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:54,300
 and there was this beautiful meeting room there with a big table there with the pictures

875
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,980
 of our founding fathers across the overhead there.

876
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,780
 And when we sat down, he sat at the head of the table, I sat to his right.

877
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,920
 He had a legal pad to take notes on.

878
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,660
 And there was a book on the table too, it was called Majestic.

879
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:17,820
 It was a book by Whitley Strieber, which actually is a fictional account of an established fact

880
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:18,820
 there.

881
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,620
 And he said, this is not fiction.

882
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:24,500
 So he admitted to me right there, this is not fiction.

883
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,580
 This is a story about the Roswell, you know, anti-fictionalized version.

884
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:32,500
 And so as a conclusion, you came to after you had a chance to listen to some people

885
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,500
 that had analyzed some of that material, am I correct in that?

886
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,500
 Yes.

887
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,980
 And I'm not necessarily saying you may have been right or wrong on that.

888
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:46,900
 I'm just wanting to know how you arrived at your decision that you believe it is from

889
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:51,540
 non-terrestrial sources or extra-terrestrial sources.

890
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:58,020
 Well, you know, this is the first time somebody in the, you know, in the re-sanctions of

891
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,660
 our government admitted to me that this is not fiction, the Roswell.

892
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,300
 And I said, I know it isn't.

893
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,360
 So when are you guys going to tell the public about this?

894
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,740
 And he said, well, you know, if it was up to me, you ought to have done it yesterday.

895
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,460
 But he says, it is not up to me.

896
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:17,980
 I'm just here to investigate the cost of the investigates cost of keeping a secret and

897
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:18,980
 all that.

898
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:25,660
 He said, in reality, there is, and these are his words, that there is a black government,

899
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:29,660
 which sounds really conspiratorial, but that's what he said.

900
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:34,340
 He said, they have control of the debris and they answer to no one, they're not elected

901
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,180
 and have unlimited funds to spend.

902
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:41,100
 And he said, they're the ones who have it and they have control over it.

903
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,980
 So you can tell me what that meant.

904
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:44,980
 But that's what he said.

905
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,260
 I obviously don't know, but thank you very much.

906
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,260
 Yes, sir.

907
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,260
 Thank you.

908
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:58,260
 To all of you for testifying, you did a great job.

909
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:05,180
 How long, I mean, I look at what happened at Roswell as a, something that happened a

910
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:11,140
 long time ago and that there was some put down of it and there's been some fun made

911
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,260
 out of it.

912
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:18,980
 But that a lot of people, because there were enough information, enough facts out that

913
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:24,700
 a lot of people believed that something happened there.

914
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,940
 Is that, am I way off base?

915
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,780
 I mean, I'm just trying to think back a few years because it hasn't been in the paper

916
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:38,820
 recently, you know, but that's my recollection of that incident, that there was enough proof

917
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:44,140
 that we knew it was something other than from the United States.

918
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,180
 Yeah, Donald?

919
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:51,940
 As I'd mentioned in my opening statement, I'd like to emphasize that we had the good

920
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:58,420
 fortune of working with and having enlisted the late Congressman Steven Schiff of New

921
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:08,620
 Mexico who pushed for congressional hearings on this very matter through the early 90s.

922
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:14,900
 And so much so that he had sent three separate letters to then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin,

923
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:23,600
 which all went unanswered, which only intrigued him and raised his curiosity all the more

924
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,100
 as far as, well, what are they hiding?

925
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:31,980
 I'm just asking, as the late Senator Barry Goldwater and even his request to General

926
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:37,460
 Curtis LeMay, can I at least see the file to which LeMay said, "Hell, no, and don't

927
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,460
 ever ask me again."

928
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:46,660
 So we're in good company, whether we're talking about Goldwater or Schiff or even former Presidents

929
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,520
 Bill Clinton or Carter, who also would lament the fact that they could not get the truth

930
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,420
 about Roswell.

931
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:59,980
 But getting back to Congressman Schiff, in his failed efforts, as the press itself became

932
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:06,460
 more interested as to who would win this tug of war, because he was being stonewalled not

933
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:11,580
 only by the Secretary of Defense, but also the White House, and then the branches of

934
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,920
 the military.

935
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:17,940
 And he had assurances, specifically from the Air Force, that should they find anything

936
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,340
 in their files, he would be the first one.

937
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:28,540
 Well, as Newsweek magazine very aptly put it, as though a preemptive strike, they called

938
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:34,860
 a press conference here at the Pentagon, and Colonel Richard Weaver, as Colonel Randall

939
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:42,980
 mentioned, in putting out the Project Mogul theory, same balloon, it was just a redesign

940
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,180
 of the same balloon explanation.

941
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:52,220
 Now I'll never forget how I called up Congressman Schiff here in his office in Washington, thinking

942
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:59,500
 that, well, that would end that relationship, because he would have to accept that new explanation,

943
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,420
 that new solution to the Roswell mystery.

944
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:07,940
 And his immediate words, immediate response to me was, "Don, they're a bunch of damn

945
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,940
 liars."

946
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:16,820
 And he had assured us, and you know the history, he assured us that with his re-election coming

947
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,700
 up, that we would then resume the effort.

948
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:27,240
 Well, he would die shortly after his re-election, age of 51.

949
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:32,300
 We don't read anything into that except that we lost a tremendous ally.

950
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:39,420
 And in that, there was a lot of that publicity, the fact that someone within the government

951
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:46,260
 was actually sticking their nose under the curtain, under the tent, for nothing more

952
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:53,420
 than asking to see the files, and still being turned down, still being told just as Senator

953
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:57,860
 Goldwater, "Hell no, and don't ask."

954
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:11,140
 There was debris, it crashed, there was debris, and talked about touching the debris, and

955
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:17,340
 that it was not something that you'd ever felt or done before.

956
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:21,380
 Is that still around, the debris from that?

957
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:25,100
 Not with us, it isn't.

958
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,100
 That's the problem.

959
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,100
 We don't have the debris.

960
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,100
 We don't have pieces.

961
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,100
 What happened to it?

962
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:38,660
 It probably got sent to Wright Field when we know that it got sent.

963
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:44,140
 Where it went from there, whether it went to Area 51, or who knows what, we don't know.

964
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:48,900
 The security curtain slammed down very quickly.

965
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:49,900
 How quickly afterwards?

966
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:50,900
 Five hours.

967
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,900
 How many?

968
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:52,900
 Five hours.

969
01:08:52,900 --> 01:09:02,260
 From the actual announcement of the recovery of the flying disc, it evolved, as I mentioned,

970
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,700
 within five hours into the weather balloon.

971
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:11,860
 In fact, as Stanton mentioned, and we have Brigadier General Thomas DeBose, who is even

972
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:16,860
 in two of the pictures with the substituted weather balloon.

973
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:22,760
 He stated that the balloon was a hoax, that part of it.

974
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:30,020
 They were ordered, as he described, to get the press off of General Ramey's back.

975
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:35,980
 They were the ones who substituted the balloon for the real material.

976
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:41,160
 When you have a Brigadier General going on the record, actually stating that the official

977
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:47,740
 government explanation is a hoax, you would think it would get the media's attention.

978
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:52,620
 That's also the dilemma that we have had with the very conception of the investigation of

979
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:57,540
 the Roswell incident, the fact that, well, why don't the witnesses come forward?

980
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:05,380
 Because just as Jesse's father, just imagine, at that time, he was a lieutenant colonel.

981
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:08,300
 He was the head of intelligence of the 509th Bomb Group.

982
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:14,940
 Again, I can't use the word enough, the elite within the military, head of intelligence.

983
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:20,040
 We might even ask, why would the base commander, Colonel Blanchard, instead of just sending

984
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:26,540
 out a couple of grunts, a couple of enlisted men to go check out this funny material, he

985
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:35,620
 sends out his two head of intelligence, two officers, follow the rancher back and investigate

986
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:39,660
 this firsthand on a Fourth of July weekend, no less.

987
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:47,180
 See, these are all the questions that the press refuses to look into, but we haven't.

988
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:54,300
 That dilemma, that as Major Marcel, when he finally stepped forward and said, being familiar

989
01:10:54,300 --> 01:11:02,100
 with all materials, both familiar and domestic, this was something not made on this earth.

990
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,380
 We didn't read about this in the papers, did we?

991
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,220
 It wasn't on the CBS Evening News.

992
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:12,640
 The only publication to touch that was the National Enquirer.

993
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:19,820
 So we wonder why there's this constant taboo, this ridicule factor, and it's the very reason

994
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:25,040
 that witnesses have refused to come forward after all these years because they know how

995
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,700
 it's going to be treated.

996
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:29,700
 Thank you.

997
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,700
 Thank you.

998
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:37,380
 I'm going to ask Colonel Randall.

999
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:45,180
 What is the significance of the July 1947 Roswell incident in that we also had a significant

1000
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,980
 one in July of 1945?

1001
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:48,980
 Tell me.

1002
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:49,980
 What is the significance?

1003
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,720
 Well, the events in Roswell in 1947 set up the entire cover-up.

1004
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,620
 At that point ... Cover-up of what?

1005
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:00,380
 Cover-up of the alien visitation.

1006
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:06,820
 What we look at is, after the Kenneth Arnold signing on June 24, 1947, there was an awful

1007
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:10,100
 lot of stories in the newspapers about flying saucers.

1008
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,120
 There was all kinds of discussion about what they were.

1009
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,220
 One scientist postulated that if you left a dark movie theater and you walked out into

1010
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:20,060
 the bright sunlight, you'd see spots in front of your eyes.

1011
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,020
 This is what people were seeing.

1012
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:25,940
 Didn't explain why the spots were black instead of silver.

1013
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:28,380
 There were military officers making comments.

1014
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:32,460
 At one point, one officer said, "Well, we're not interested in the flying saucers anymore."

1015
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,460
 Okay, stop.

1016
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,220
 I don't want to know the editorial.

1017
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:40,180
 I want to know what, about the Roswell incident, began the cover-up.

1018
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,500
 You just said it.

1019
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,780
 No, don't give me the editorial pile.

1020
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,780
 Just stay on that part.

1021
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,060
 Stay on the scientific part right there.

1022
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,260
 What happened at Roswell, the cover-up of the alien, whatever we think that is.

1023
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:55,500
 I hate that word, or whatever that is.

1024
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,920
 Why, even yet today, why?

1025
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,240
 In 1947, we'd just come out of a war.

1026
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,860
 We are worried about our competitors in the world.

1027
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:13,220
 If we can exploit this find, discover the propulsion system, discover the materials, how they work,

1028
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:16,380
 we take a huge step ahead of our competitors and the rest of the world.

1029
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,980
 In 1947, it makes perfect sense.

1030
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,100
 We don't want people talking about this.

1031
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,980
 The Russians aren't going to spy on us if they don't think there's anything there to

1032
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:27,860
 spy on, so they've eliminated our competitors.

1033
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:33,020
 Why it persists today, I am somewhat puzzled about, because it would seem that we've become

1034
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:38,380
 much more sophisticated, and we would understand what's going on in the world around us and

1035
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,380
 space around us.

1036
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,220
 Unless we still don't understand.

1037
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:44,840
 I think the problem is we haven't decoded the materials.

1038
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,840
 Okay.

1039
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,840
 Thank you, sir.

1040
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,840
 That was good.

1041
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:53,300
 Now you guys who know these people, you don't get to be a major in any of our militaries

1042
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:58,700
 unless you're a well-respected, highly decorated individual about our nation, our family, and

1043
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,620
 who we are, and that with your father, sir.

1044
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:02,980
 Congratulations on that.

1045
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:10,660
 As 11 years old, if you testify today, you witnessed the Roswell Incident's crash.

1046
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,020
 I'm saying crash.

1047
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,660
 You might've called it something else.

1048
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,620
 Crash is good, okay.

1049
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:22,980
 You witnessed particles from the crash, balloon notwithstanding, whatever else they said not

1050
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:29,300
 withstanding, actually saw particles of what the craft may or may not have been.

1051
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,300
 Did you not?

1052
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,300
 Yes, ma'am.

1053
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:40,500
 Decorated father, you're now a Colonel, a medical doctor, and the Roswell Incident continues

1054
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,780
 to be mysterious to some, factual to many.

1055
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:48,300
 You had firsthand information and now your children who have lived with a grandfather

1056
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:53,580
 and a father they've respected of high decorated ability and consequence and served in our

1057
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:54,580
 military.

1058
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:57,260
 Military has a special emphasis in most countries and certainly in ours.

1059
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:00,140
 That's why everybody who testified in these three days to me, who's ever military, have

1060
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:03,700
 the highest respect for this service and dedication.

1061
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:08,620
 What would you offer to this committee at this time on this issue, Roswell, that would

1062
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:11,220
 help me to understand and the rest of us as well?

1063
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:15,460
 Where we go from here, what you've seen, you've already kind of gave us a sample of it and

1064
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,580
 all of that.

1065
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:19,300
 What else should we know before we get up from here today?

1066
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:24,180
 Well, I think what it does, it tells us that we are not alone in the universe.

1067
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:29,700
 As a matter of fact, there's other civilizations out there and they're finding Earth-like

1068
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:34,660
 planets around other store systems every day.

1069
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:41,300
 That means that we are probably just beginners, new kids on the block, so to speak.

1070
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:45,140
 They are obviously more advanced than we are in their science and hopefully their cultural

1071
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:50,940
 abilities too, that they can get here from wherever they come from.

1072
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:58,780
 It also means that they survive their nuclear destructive abilities too.

1073
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:05,460
 I think any civilization that develops into the space travel has gone through a nuclear

1074
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:12,500
 age and we're still on the precipice of either surviving or not surviving ours, but it means

1075
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,500
 they did.

1076
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:19,260
 If they can do it, we can also survive our nuclear war-like tendencies.

1077
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:26,420
 My last final point for me, are you aware through your father or own experiences that

1078
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:31,460
 we chase their aircraft or we have an occasion and obviously they have traced ours?

1079
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:34,100
 Does that exist and if so, why and did we find anything?

1080
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,180
 Did they catch us or are we gone or what?

1081
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:42,620
 Well, I just know what I'm reading in the papers.

1082
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:43,620
 Okay, that's okay.

1083
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,620
 Don't speculate.

1084
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:48,260
 I'm just an observer of one event there and I have a lot of theories, but—

1085
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:49,260
 I bet.

1086
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,260
 I'll talk to you offline on those.

1087
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,260
 Okay.

1088
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,260
 Okay.

1089
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,260
 Thank you very much.

1090
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,260
 I yield back.

1091
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,260
 Thank you.

1092
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:56,260
 Thank you.

1093
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,560
 I yield back to Congresswoman Linda Wolfson.

1094
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:03,140
 Thank you.

1095
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:11,340
 There's just so much and it's—you just—you, Marcells, I mean, don't you all worry that

1096
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:15,020
 this isn't going to be resolved in your lifetime?

1097
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,300
 I mean, good grief, tick, tick, tick.

1098
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,300
 Here we are.

1099
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,940
 I mean, what—you know, gray hair and gray hair and—

1100
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:24,940
 I'm 76.

1101
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:32,140
 Some pretty old people, the three of us, but I mean, then your story, then what happens

1102
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:33,140
 to your story?

1103
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:39,280
 I mean, it's—and your story, the truth, but it's so much more meaningful when it

1104
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,280
 comes from you.

1105
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:47,100
 Well, as a 76-year-old, you know, I'm no spring chicken, but, you know, I like to tell

1106
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,100
 my story.

1107
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:53,580
 I don't want to embellish it, not tell exactly what I knew about this, and if people want

1108
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,840
 to believe this, that's okay.

1109
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,980
 If they don't want to believe it, that's also okay.

1110
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:58,980
 That's their opinion.

1111
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:03,160
 I would certainly like to have the government spill the beans about this while I'm still

1112
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:08,020
 alive to say, "I told you so," but, I mean, I'd be—but it doesn't matter.

1113
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:13,180
 I've been there and done that, so I know what it was.

1114
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:14,180
 Okay.

1115
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:21,060
 All of you experts, how many actual ETs have been—I'm going to start saying that instead

1116
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:29,420
 of the big long word—have been involved in starting with the Roswell and the two years

1117
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,420
 before.

1118
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:38,820
 Wasn't there an actual person—not person—living being, living something as part of that crash

1119
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:50,140
 before you said that somebody was offered to go in and see, you know, the remains of

1120
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,620
 something?

1121
01:18:51,620 --> 01:19:01,420
 The story was, Walter Haught, as the public information officer, had issued the press

1122
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:06,340
 release saying that he had retrieved a crash-flying saucer.

1123
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:11,060
 In the years that followed, he just said, "All I did was write the press release."

1124
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,060
 Right.

1125
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:19,780
 Upon his, Don Schmidt and Tom Carey put together, working with Walter Haught and his family,

1126
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:25,260
 put together an affidavit to be released after he passed away, giving much more information,

1127
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:30,620
 and he talked about having actually seen the bodies of the aliens and more about that.

1128
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:36,100
 The important thing was this Richard Harris, who was a financial officer at Roswell in

1129
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:42,620
 1947, told me long before Walter admitted to that, that Walter had taken—or seen him

1130
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:45,820
 in a hangar and said, "If you want to see something really incredible, it's beyond

1131
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:50,340
 that door," and Harris didn't want to go in there and see the bodies, but it was the

1132
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:52,060
 body of the alien craft.

1133
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:55,660
 The other part of the question is, did one survive the crash?

1134
01:19:55,660 --> 01:20:00,780
 There has been testimony from a number of witnesses, yes, that one survived the craft

1135
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:03,900
 and was in captivity.

1136
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:09,460
 I hesitate to use that word because it really wasn't in captivity, but it was held for

1137
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,860
 a number of years.

1138
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,500
 Can you think of anything that would be more lonely than that?

1139
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,820
 You're an alien creature on a planet.

1140
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:19,740
 You have absolutely no possibility of getting home.

1141
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:25,020
 You're dealing with a bunch of sentient beings that do not understand you, your culture,

1142
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,780
 or your language, and you're stuck on this planet without any hope of rescue.

1143
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:32,900
 It sounds like a Steven Spielberg movie.

1144
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:38,940
 But the point is, there is some testimony that suggests that one may have survived for

1145
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,380
 a period of time.

1146
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:44,940
 I believe the date of its supposed death was in 1952.

1147
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,980
 Well, since then, okay, since then?

1148
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:55,260
 One of the things beyond first-hand witnesses to the materials, to the wreckage, to the

1149
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:02,660
 characteristics that even by today's standards defy conventional explanation have been, sadly,

1150
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:08,220
 but also much to the credit, again, of the witnesses in maintaining that sacred oath

1151
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:15,620
 to the Constitution, that so many of them, to their very deathbeds, before they would

1152
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:24,900
 finally confide to their spouses, to their children, and invariably, they all talk about

1153
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,820
 the little people, the little men.

1154
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:32,900
 They all describe either having been out at the site and having witnessed the bodies,

1155
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:39,620
 or they were posted at the hangar, P3, Building 84, at the Roswell Army Airfield, where they

1156
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:45,580
 were on guard, and they would observe the wooden crates being assembled and the bodies

1157
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:49,100
 being placed into these boxes before being shipped out.

1158
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,700
 Shipped out to where?

1159
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:56,940
 Well, we have the documentation, again, and we have the eyewitness testimony right field

1160
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:59,120
 in Dayton, Ohio.

1161
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:07,060
 We have the late Brigadier General Arthur Exon, who was with Foreign Technology Division,

1162
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:12,800
 which did the testing, the reverse engineering of captured weaponry and armory from World

1163
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,260
 War II.

1164
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:20,740
 So it made perfect sense that you had something crash of either foreign or something beyond

1165
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,300
 that design.

1166
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:25,500
 It would go to foreign technology.

1167
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:32,020
 And Exon described, not firsthand, but that he was aware of the fact that when the materials

1168
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:39,800
 from Roswell arrived, when they came in, it was the first impression, because no one was

1169
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:45,940
 able to recognize this wreckage, that it most likely was Soviet.

1170
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:52,460
 But after it was tested, he described that there was a unanimous consensus that the materials

1171
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:56,940
 had to be from space.

1172
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:58,460
 So any of that recently?

1173
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:02,180
 I mean, that was quite a while ago.

1174
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:09,460
 We've conducted to date three archaeological digs at the debris field site, the very site

1175
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:16,860
 that had this huge debris field that canvassed an area of almost three quarters of a mile

1176
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:19,500
 long, hundreds of feet wide.

1177
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,780
 Where is it?

1178
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:23,660
 This is just outside of Corona, New Mexico.

1179
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:28,060
 It's about 65 miles northwest of Roswell.

1180
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:35,260
 This is where the rancher first reported the find and then led the two intelligence officers,

1181
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:41,300
 Major Marcel and the head of counterintelligence, Captain Sheridan Cavett.

1182
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,300
 Okay.

1183
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,300
 Okay.

1184
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,300
 Thank you.

1185
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,300
 Thank you very much.

1186
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:46,300
 Thank you, Congressman.

1187
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:53,820
 Did your father, Colonel, mention seeing bodies?

1188
01:23:53,820 --> 01:24:01,140
 Actually, the closest that came to it, my wife asked me one day, "Did you see the bodies?"

1189
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:05,380
 And he said, "No, I did not see them myself, but I knew people who did."

1190
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,380
 But what?

1191
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,580
 He knew people who did see the bodies, but he did not see them himself.

1192
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:10,580
 Okay.

1193
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:13,260
 I need a blanket statement right there.

1194
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:16,020
 My wife is the one who asked me, finally came out and asked me.

1195
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:17,780
 Who were the people that saw the bodies?

1196
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:22,020
 He did not elaborate, so I'm not sure who he was.

1197
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,540
 But to answer the question, no, he did not see the bodies.

1198
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:25,540
 Okay.

1199
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:29,400
 I'm trying to understand the sequence of events, what happened here.

1200
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:35,900
 You mentioned, Mr. Smith, that they sent two officers there when ordinarily they would

1201
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:41,740
 have sent some lower level people to investigate.

1202
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:46,900
 What was unusual, when they simply got the word from the rancher that something had crashed,

1203
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,420
 why would they think that was unusual enough to send officers?

1204
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,940
 That is the question.

1205
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:51,940
 Yeah.

1206
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,940
 What is it?

1207
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:55,980
 And again, especially on a Fourth of July weekend, that it would have been brought to

1208
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:56,980
 the attention.

1209
01:24:56,980 --> 01:25:01,180
 Now, keep in mind, the rancher did not go to the military.

1210
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:09,580
 He reported this to the sheriff, Sheriff George Wilcox of Chavez County, headquartered in Roswell.

1211
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:13,780
 And it was only due to the fact that it was a reporter by the name of Frank Joyce from

1212
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:19,900
 radio station KGFL, who suggested, "This sounds like a military matter.

1213
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:23,460
 You should report this to the 509th."

1214
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:31,140
 And they, in turn, the sheriff contacts the base, personally speaks to Major Marcel, who

1215
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:34,380
 was at the PX having a sandwich.

1216
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:39,860
 And it's important enough, again, Fourth of July weekend, that he alerts the very base

1217
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:43,560
 commander, Colonel William Blanchard.

1218
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:52,100
 And after examining the material, if it was nothing more mundane than a weather balloon,

1219
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:56,260
 or even an aircraft, a rocket, an errant rocket.

1220
01:25:56,260 --> 01:26:01,700
 We were testing German V-2 rockets over at White Sands at that time.

1221
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:08,420
 It was still unusual enough that he would dispatch the two head of intelligence.

1222
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:15,060
 And we believe the reason he also sent the head of counterintelligence, Plane Close,

1223
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:21,140
 Captain Sheridan Cabot, was in the event it was something foreign, that he would be the

1224
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:25,960
 most capable of identifying it if it was something foreign.

1225
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,780
 Did the rancher go to the site before the military?

1226
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:30,780
 Yes.

1227
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:33,300
 He was the one who first discovered the briefing.

1228
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:37,620
 But we don't know specifically what the rancher reported.

1229
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:43,380
 He must have reported something somewhat unusual for them to send two officers rather than

1230
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:44,380
 two enlisted men.

1231
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:47,140
 He brought some of the wreckage with him.

1232
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,140
 Yes.

1233
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,140
 Okay, okay.

1234
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:54,260
 He drove into the sheriff's office, the sheriff calls the base, Major Marcel goes and checks

1235
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:58,820
 it out, and as he told me, there wasn't anything conventional there.

1236
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:03,020
 But the rancher also stressed that there's a huge amount of this stuff out at the ranch.

1237
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,020
 Yeah.

1238
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:07,300
 Three-quarters of a mile, a few hundred yards wide, that's a lot of stuff.

1239
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:12,940
 And what he was worried about was that his sheep wouldn't cross the debris field.

1240
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:17,180
 This is desert country out there, they need to go where the water is.

1241
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:21,980
 They also don't want sheep eating anything like pieces of foil.

1242
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,720
 It is a concern.

1243
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:27,860
 So that was his concern also, and we haven't mentioned it.

1244
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:34,740
 There was an article in the local paper that rewards were being offered for pieces of one

1245
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:38,820
 of these saucers people were seeing all over the place.

1246
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:44,540
 And when the rancher went to Corona and talked to his buddies there at Corona, that's where

1247
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:49,780
 they did shopping and stuff like that, this is out in the middle of nowhere, they told

1248
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:52,780
 him about the reward.

1249
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:56,020
 You had to go try to collect the reward.

1250
01:27:56,020 --> 01:28:02,780
 And we have stories, and I don't know how we can confirm them, that the rancher suddenly

1251
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:06,700
 wound up with some money after all this.

1252
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:11,980
 He certainly was entitled to the reward, and the military said, "No way, Jose."

1253
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,860
 Was he also sworn to secrecy?

1254
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:16,220
 Do we know that, the rancher?

1255
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:26,340
 Two years later when his son, Bill Jr., had recovered enough pieces to fill up a cigar

1256
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:33,380
 box, and his wife Shirley even described how he'd come home for dinner after working the

1257
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:38,140
 ranch and he kept this one piece in his leather chaps, and she would describe how he would

1258
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:44,900
 take this piece out, and she'd watch as he'd try to whittle on it and poke through it,

1259
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:49,020
 and then he would crumble it up, crease it, fold it, and every time you'd lay it down

1260
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:53,020
 it would just smooth right out.

1261
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:59,420
 Two years later, there's a knock on his door, and there was a military captain and three

1262
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,380
 non-commissioned officers.

1263
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:05,060
 We know what you have, and you will give it to us.

1264
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:09,060
 So he turned over the box, this was two years after the incident.

1265
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:18,520
 They mentioned to him, according to Bill Jr., that just as your father swore that he would

1266
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:23,140
 not say another word about this, and should he ever discover any more material, he would

1267
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,020
 contact us immediately.

1268
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:28,380
 We're asking the same of you.

1269
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:32,980
 We should mention one other thing here that I think gives an idea of the scope of the

1270
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:35,700
 concern by the military here.

1271
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:43,380
 We have heard testimony from the daughter of the sheriff, that she was staying with

1272
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:49,780
 her grandmother, it was the granddaughter, grandmother, it was a show on television about

1273
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:59,260
 UFOs, and the grandmother says to the granddaughter, "You know, the reason your grandfather didn't

1274
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:07,100
 rerun for sheriff was when that saucer crashed, the military came to him and said, 'If you

1275
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:12,260
 ever tell about what you saw, we will kill you and we will kill your family.'"

1276
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:13,260
 She was horrified.

1277
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:17,740
 "You didn't believe them," she says to her grandmother.

1278
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:21,700
 "I was there, I believed them," was the answer.

1279
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,620
 So sure, it's a little story, but we've heard it.

1280
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:32,220
 The granddaughter was a teacher, they were, how shall I put this, threatening.

1281
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:39,520
 Could the gentleman from Maryland yield just 30 seconds to clear up one question that's,

1282
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:47,820
 and anybody that can answer this, can anybody here give us the name of any person that would

1283
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:56,860
 have been at least the age of 18 or older in 1947 who at the time, in a similar way

1284
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:04,220
 to how Jesse Marcel Sr. said he had received these kinds of materials and they had these

1285
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:08,260
 certain property trades, which he said almost immediately to people.

1286
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:14,540
 Is there anybody other than, or even the child, or who, can you give us the name of anybody

1287
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:23,700
 who said they saw a body, they saw bodies back in 1947 in the name of any person that

1288
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:27,240
 you've got in, you know, you've written, or you've studied this?

1289
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,240
 We should mention that.

1290
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:34,420
 We talked about, you know, and I know that Mr. Marcel said that he knew people that had

1291
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:36,940
 seen the bodies, but he never said he had seen a body.

1292
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:41,540
 I just want to make sure that we have a witness if we do or if we don't.

1293
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:47,100
 I just want to know that could give the kind of credibility on the question of bodies,

1294
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:54,260
 which was talked about rather freely a few minutes ago, in the same vein, who has seen

1295
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:58,880
 a body and said so back in 1947, '48, that's my question.

1296
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,860
 If you're looking for documentation from 1947, we simply don't have it.

1297
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:06,820
 If you want the name of somebody who was there in 1947 who saw bodies, then we have lots

1298
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:07,820
 of names.

1299
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:11,940
 Even Easley, the provost marshal, mentioned to his family that he had seen the bodies.

1300
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:17,860
 He mentioned that they quizzed him about it when he was very gravely ill with cancer,

1301
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,740
 about that, and he said, "Oh, the creatures to them."

1302
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:26,340
 Of course, I asked who had seen the bodies and said so in the same time period.

1303
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:28,540
 Nobody was asking those questions in 1947.

1304
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:36,420
 Yeah, but nobody was asking about debris either until Mr. Marcel said, "I've seen this debris."

1305
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:37,420
 Precisely.

1306
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:38,420
 We have-

1307
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:40,980
 Are you saying that nobody said anything about bodies back in 1947?

1308
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:44,420
 It was only until way later?

1309
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:45,420
 I just want to know.

1310
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:46,420
 I mean, I'm not questioning-

1311
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:47,420
 That's probably an accurate statement.

1312
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:48,420
 I don't know.

1313
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:50,340
 I'm a little confused on the issue is what I'm-

1314
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:55,220
 What you have to understand is after the story broke in the newspapers, the military got

1315
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:57,140
 everybody out of town.

1316
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:01,260
 Marcel is not ... If you're a reporter and you're looking for Major Marcel, you can't

1317
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:02,260
 find him.

1318
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:05,860
 If you want to talk to Mac Brazel, you can't find him.

1319
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:10,620
 If I could just recline my question, just so I make sure I'm clear here, what I'm trying

1320
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:11,620
 to ask.

1321
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:16,620
 Hey, the Army, the Air Force, they could have been covering up from day ... less than

1322
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,620
 day one.

1323
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:18,620
 They could from the first second.

1324
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:20,500
 That's not what I'm asking about.

1325
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:26,820
 I'm asking was there any person at the time, and maybe they can't because of a cover-up

1326
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:27,820
 even at the time.

1327
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:34,260
 I'm just saying, is there the name of anybody, living or dead, who in 1947, it was documented,

1328
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:40,700
 they said, and at that time, said, not on their deathbed, not later after they had some

1329
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:44,500
 other situation, but at the time, said they saw a body.

1330
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,500
 That's my question.

1331
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,500
 I understand the question.

1332
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:49,300
 I understand the question, and the answer is no.

1333
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:53,260
 We have no documentation from that timeframe when they saw the bodies.

1334
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:57,580
 What we have are the people who were there, who later on talked about it.

1335
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:58,580
 Most of these people-

1336
01:33:58,580 --> 01:33:59,580
 I understand what you're saying.

1337
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:04,340
 ... didn't come forward with their tails.

1338
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,340
 That was the-

1339
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,340
 But I wasn't trying to-

1340
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:12,340
 That's the last time you'll yield to the gentleman from Utah.

1341
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:13,340
 Let me-

1342
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:16,140
 Let me make just one closing observation.

1343
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:18,180
 Oh, one quick question.

1344
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:22,300
 Were there any radar tracks from FAA over this?

1345
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,300
 No?

1346
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,500
 No radar tracks that you know of?

1347
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,500
 No.

1348
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,500
 Okay, none.

1349
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,500
 Okay.

1350
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:28,500
 Curious about that.

1351
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:33,580
 Curious about this, that tell me if I didn't know anything else and never met any of you,

1352
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:39,860
 that the Air Force is not being honest.

1353
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:47,900
 One is, if this was indeed a balloon, there was no darned reason to send it to right field.

1354
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:50,620
 Everybody would have recognized the balloon, so the very fact that they sent the material

1355
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:56,060
 there tells me that they're not telling the truth.

1356
01:34:56,060 --> 01:35:00,380
 The second thing that tells me they're not telling the truth is that if in fact it was

1357
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:05,060
 a balloon, why in the heck would it issue a press release saying that a flying saucer

1358
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:07,700
 had crashed there?

1359
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,620
 I don't know how you can argue away those two things.

1360
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:16,920
 The debunker would say that's because Colonel Blanchard was a loose cannon, and he probably

1361
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,220
 got banned to Siberia for putting out that stupid story.

1362
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,020
 I've had somebody tell me that.

1363
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:25,100
 They don't mention he got four more promotions.

1364
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:30,260
 He was a four-star general when he died of a heart attack, and was Vice Chief of Staff

1365
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,540
 of the Air Force.

1366
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:33,700
 That's not what you do when you have a loose cannon.

1367
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:40,100
 Those two things alone tell the honest observer that they are not now telling us the truth.

1368
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:46,300
 A balloon is not going to be sent to Wright-Patterson, and a balloon is not going to result in a

1369
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:50,260
 press release that says that a flying saucer has crashed.

1370
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:51,340
 That was the press release.

1371
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:55,300
 It's what they did with what they found there, and what they found there as far as we know

1372
01:35:55,300 --> 01:36:00,700
 is either still in Wright-Patterson or has been destroyed, right?

1373
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:02,340
 Or it's been moved to another location.

1374
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,940
 Or, yeah, it's still in their possession.

1375
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:10,340
 It can be tracked to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base with documentation.

1376
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:11,340
 Wright Field then, I think.

1377
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:13,620
 Wright Field at the time, yes.

1378
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:15,900
 From that point on, we don't know where it went.

1379
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,440
 It could have gone to Area 51.

1380
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:23,180
 We've been told that one of the bodies went to McNeil, which was an aerospace medical

1381
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,180
 facility.

1382
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,180
 Okay.

1383
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:27,180
 Thank you for being generous with time, sir.

1384
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:28,180
 Well, that's okay.

1385
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:31,100
 I was pushing in to keep that sign up.

1386
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:35,380
 I get three minutes.

1387
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:43,260
 First off, having been a CIC officer, we had a set format report system.

1388
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:53,620
 Was there any documentation within the CIC about the report of going to the crash site?

1389
01:36:53,620 --> 01:37:02,180
 What was especially interesting to us was after Major Marcel was sent directly, and

1390
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:10,220
 as Kevin had mentioned, how they took all the key players immediately out of the picture,

1391
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:15,260
 that anybody who had information on this was immediately either sent away or went on leave

1392
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:20,580
 or in the case of Colonel Blanchard, he set up an operation at the crash site.

1393
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:24,900
 They were unavailable to the press, and yet there was still a lot of rumor throughout

1394
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:25,900
 the area.

1395
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:31,260
 In fact, in talking to surviving people throughout the Roswell area, there was a lot of talk

1396
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:36,820
 about the bodies, a lot of rumor about bodies recovered, a lot of talk about the little

1397
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:40,500
 men recovered north of town.

1398
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:47,020
 As far as the counterintelligence officer, when Major Marcel was sent for the balloon

1399
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:54,020
 press conference in Fort Worth with General Ramey, he was kept overnight, and then when

1400
01:37:54,020 --> 01:38:03,820
 he returned late afternoon the next day, July 9th, on the very flight that we're convinced

1401
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:10,320
 transported a crate of material which was hidden in bomb pit number one, and it wasn't

1402
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,700
 an atomic bomb.

1403
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:15,700
 We have first-hand testimony to that fact, we even have a copy of the manifest.

1404
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:22,420
 It was an unscheduled flight that went out at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, July 9th.

1405
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:30,720
 Well, Marcel, the next morning, the morning of July 10th, he immediately confronted Cavett.

1406
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,100
 He wanted to see the report.

1407
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:39,500
 He wanted to know what had transpired in his absence while he had been kept over at Fort

1408
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:40,500
 Worth.

1409
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,140
 What did Cavett say?

1410
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:46,820
 And Cavett kept responding, and this was also in the presence of counterintelligence non-commissioned

1411
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:52,780
 officer Louis Rickett, who we also interviewed quite extensively, that Cavett kept telling

1412
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:56,260
 him or kept responding, "What are you talking about?

1413
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:57,260
 What are you talking about?

1414
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:59,220
 Nothing happened."

1415
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:07,900
 And Marcel finally reminded him, "I outrank you," to which Cavett responded, "It's out

1416
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,580
 of my hands.

1417
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:11,540
 Take it up with Washington.

1418
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:14,220
 They're now calling the shots."

1419
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:15,700
 Thank you very much.

1420
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:24,220
 I want to ask questions of an 11-year-old boy.

1421
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:28,740
 This is not a hypnotic situation.

1422
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:31,660
 Put your mind back as an 11-year-old.

1423
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,700
 You're in the living room.

1424
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:42,180
 Did your dad come back from the site in a pick-up truck, in a sedan, do you recall?

1425
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:44,740
 We had a 1942 Buick convertible.

1426
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:49,900
 Okay, so he didn't have a military vehicle, he took his own vehicle to go to the site.

1427
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:50,900
 That's correct.

1428
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,900
 Okay.

1429
01:39:51,900 --> 01:40:00,340
 Did your dad come back in his vehicle, was Captain Cavett with him or was your dad alone?

1430
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:01,340
 He was alone.

1431
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:02,340
 He was alone.

1432
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:08,020
 He took some, you weren't there at the vehicle or you were in the living room, he took some

1433
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:11,340
 material out of the vehicle and brought it into the living room.

1434
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:12,340
 Correct?

1435
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,340
 Actually, in the kitchen.

1436
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,340
 In the kitchen.

1437
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,340
 Okay.

1438
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:16,340
 Now, how big was it?

1439
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:17,340
 A little bit big?

1440
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:18,340
 You got a kitchen table now.

1441
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:19,340
 What did you see in the kitchen table?

1442
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:20,340
 An 11-year-old boy.

1443
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:25,060
 Well, this was distributed on the floor of the kitchen, which was about eight by, oh,

1444
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:30,180
 seven by five or eight by 10 area.

1445
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:34,540
 He had pre-positioned the material on the kitchen floor before he got us up.

1446
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:40,540
 So when we got up and walked into the kitchen, the debris was already pre-positioned on the

1447
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:45,620
 floor of the kitchen, which was about maybe 30 square feet worth, you know, just a couple

1448
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:46,620
 of...

1449
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:47,620
 So you weren't there when he brought it in.

1450
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:52,300
 And he set it all up and then called you and your mother to come in and, "Let's take a

1451
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:53,300
 look at this."

1452
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:54,300
 Exactly.

1453
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:55,300
 He pre-positioned it.

1454
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,300
 Okay.

1455
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,980
 Pre-positioning, he was trying to form somewhat of a design, if you're pre-positioning.

1456
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:02,500
 Well, I think he was trying to put it together, you know, but there's so much of it, you couldn't

1457
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:03,500
 do that.

1458
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:04,500
 There wasn't enough.

1459
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,500
 Yes.

1460
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:11,020
 And was a beam like this, which you're circling, is this one of the things you saw there on

1461
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:12,020
 the floor?

1462
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:13,020
 Yeah.

1463
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:14,020
 There are several beams like that.

1464
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:19,380
 And like I said, there was also some black plastic debris, like a broken phonograph record

1465
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:26,460
 at that time, but it wasn't that, it wasn't vinyl.

1466
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:32,860
 But the debris primarily was the beams, the foil, and the black plastic debris.

1467
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,860
 I did not, again, see any electronics.

1468
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:39,820
 As your father is talking to you and your mother, did he mention any fact that, "Boy,

1469
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:44,460
 we saw this debris and look at it, but we also saw some bodies"?

1470
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:46,100
 Did he say anything like that?

1471
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,100
 No, sir.

1472
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:54,060
 So he made, he did not want to horrify you as a child or your mother that he saw something

1473
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:55,100
 worse than that.

1474
01:41:55,100 --> 01:42:01,100
 So do you have any conclusion from the conversation as an 11-year-old that maybe your dad was

1475
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:03,060
 not telling you everything that he saw?

1476
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:05,580
 The bodies were at another location.

1477
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:08,180
 It wasn't all in one place.

1478
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:14,100
 The debris was over here, the crew compartment, call it what you want, was someplace else.

1479
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:15,100
 Very good.

1480
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:16,100
 That's a good addition.

1481
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:20,100
 But I want to stay with the 11-year-old boy.

1482
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,100
 Yes.

1483
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:25,420
 The question was, I'm sorry.

1484
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,660
 Oh, well.

1485
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:34,660
 Did you have any inkling as an 11-year-old that your father was withholding horrific information

1486
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:39,260
 from you as he's displaying the physical findings?

1487
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:41,660
 He kind of kept things close to his chest.

1488
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:48,380
 So I'm not sure what the internal thoughts were on this, but he was very adamant that

1489
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,740
 we were not to talk about it.

1490
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:51,260
 That we were going to what?

1491
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:54,440
 That we were not to talk about this.

1492
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:56,860
 But he kept things close to his chest.

1493
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:02,220
 He had a job on the base, and I really never knew what he did because he was an intelligence,

1494
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:08,340
 he didn't really confide with the family what his job was or what he did, things like that.

1495
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:13,340
 Which would be the normal task of a father who's an intelligence.

1496
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:19,140
 Is there anything else you can share with us of your impressions and knowledge of an

1497
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:22,140
 11-year-old boy?

1498
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:31,020
 Well, it was a very Earth awakening experience or space awakening experience for me.

1499
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:37,580
 It did make this very, did make me very interested in astronomy and cosmology because I realized

1500
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:43,500
 that whatever was on the kitchen floor didn't come from here, but came from out there.

1501
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:47,340
 I got that impression from other comments that you've made that you've intellectualized

1502
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:49,980
 your experience quite extensively.

1503
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:53,980
 Let me close this facet for another hearing.

1504
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:55,780
 We're going to take a segment.

1505
01:43:55,780 --> 01:43:56,780
 Carolyn has a question.

1506
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:57,780
 Carolyn, please.

1507
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:59,780
 I heard you were about to close it, and I just wanted to ask.

1508
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:03,780
 I just wanted to ask something you just said.

1509
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:07,020
 The major was an intelligence high-level man.

1510
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:08,380
 Yes, ma'am.

1511
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:09,940
 Kept things close to his chest.

1512
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:10,940
 Yes, ma'am.

1513
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:15,460
 Didn't share a lot with you that he felt was very high intellectually, has to do with

1514
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:16,460
 his work.

1515
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,460
 Yes.

1516
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:28,380
 But he prearranged what he had gotten that night and put it away on the floor, woke you

1517
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:31,540
 up and your mom to come take a look at it.

1518
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:39,700
 Now, that in and of itself, this goes my mystery side of me, but then that was significant.

1519
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:41,520
 He wanted you to talk about it.

1520
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:46,580
 He never talked to you about it, but he wanted you to see that and never to mention it again.

1521
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:47,580
 What do you make of that?

1522
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:48,580
 Well, later.

1523
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:49,580
 Sorry?

1524
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:55,740
 There's a time period in between when he saw it on the floor and when it came back from

1525
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:56,740
 Texas.

1526
01:44:56,740 --> 01:45:01,060
 Okay, I'm talking about just the floor and just waking you up, seeing you.

1527
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:02,060
 He didn't have to show anything.

1528
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:04,180
 He could have just took it onto the base and did whatever he did.

1529
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:05,180
 I should bring that up.

1530
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:06,180
 He thought it was significant material.

1531
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:11,540
 Right, and he wanted his child to see it and his wife who he never even discussed things

1532
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:12,540
 with.

1533
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:16,900
 At that time, the material was not classified, so he felt okay to do that.

1534
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:21,860
 As a matter of fact, the only time I knew my dad to break security clearances is when

1535
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:27,380
 he came back from overseas, I asked him what did the atomic bomb look like?

1536
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:33,620
 What he did, he drew the outline of the Fat Man bomb that was used on Nagasaki, but then

1537
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:35,500
 he tore it up and threw it away in the trash can.

1538
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:39,700
 I wasn't suggesting that he was breaking any kind of intelligence by showing it.

1539
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,700
 He thought it ... He's a major.

1540
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:42,700
 He's a big time.

1541
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:47,340
 He's up there with the generals and almost with the joint chief of staff, you know?

1542
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:52,500
 He wanted to show you what he had found and what had obviously crashed near your home,

1543
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,140
 but you couldn't say something about it.

1544
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:58,380
 Then, for whomever they are to take it and make a light of it and it never happened and

1545
01:45:58,380 --> 01:46:00,580
 it's a balloon, that doesn't go together.

1546
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:01,580
 No.

1547
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:03,740
 Again, he was very excited about this.

1548
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:07,620
 This is a very special event there.

1549
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:13,020
 He wanted my mother and myself to be first-hand witnesses to this thing, but when he came

1550
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:18,180
 back from Fort Worth after General Ramey, then he said, "No more."

1551
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:19,180
 It didn't happen.

1552
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,180
 Period.

1553
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:21,180
 Thank you.

1554
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:22,180
 Okay.

1555
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,180
 Thank you.

1556
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:24,700
 We're going to take a 10-minute stretch recess.

1557
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:29,580
 No more than that, 10 minutes, and we'll go into the next testimony.
