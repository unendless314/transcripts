1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,720
 If you will repeat after me, I hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,680
 the truth to this committee today.

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,320
 Thank you.

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,560
 Ms. Davenport, please proceed.

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,400
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentlemen on the committee.

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,480
 My name is Peter B. Davenport, I'm the director of the National UFO Reporting Center which

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,080
 has been located in the state of Washington since October of 1974.

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,280
 I'm delighted to be here and to especially have an opportunity to present data to the

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:10,680
 committee that I think is of special value to not just every member of mankind on this

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,480
 planet but in point of fact every living organism on this planet.

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,720
 And what I'd like to do, Mr. Speaker, if the chair doesn't, or Mr. Chairman, if the chair

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,680
 doesn't object, is split my presentation into three brief parts.

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,520
 First of all, I'd like to present a little bit of material on my background.

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,600
 Then I would like to discuss the National UFO Reporting Center and what it is.

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,520
 I'm probably introducing it to many members of the committee for the first time.

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,840
 And then I'm going to take an opportunity to walk the committee through a number of the

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:56,420
 roughly 86,000 reports that are in our database that I've collected over the last 19 years.

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,440
 What I'd like to do is, the only text that I'm going to read is the first paragraph

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,160
 of my position statement on the issue of UFOs, a copy of which should be in the packet of

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,080
 10 pages of material that I've submitted to committee members.

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,560
 And that first paragraph very simply is, the question of whether human beings are alone

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,600
 in the universe is the most important scientific question that has ever confronted mankind.

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,680
 And that is the issue that we are addressing today.

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,480
 A bit of my background, and I think it's important because when a person is a ufologist there's

25
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,600
 always the question of mental balance.

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,740
 At least this is what I'm told by people who look at my data and look at how I collect

27
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,600
 that data.

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,280
 So just a few brief comments.

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,280
 I've worked in both the public and the private sector.

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,320
 Have a very good education, and I think the committee has a one-page biographical statement

31
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,880
 on my background.

32
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,600
 Have an educational background in biochemistry and genetics, international business.

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,040
 I am a former Russian translator for the U.S. government in the Soviet Union.

34
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:22,680
 In June of 1979 I qualified as an escort interpreter for the U.S. Department of State.

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,480
 I've spent many years teaching at the university level.

36
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,440
 I'm a businessman, former founding president of a successful biotech firm in Seattle.

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,040
 So I'm probably not construed to be or cannot be construed to be some kind of unusual quirky

38
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,440
 person, and I speak within that context.

39
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,760
 It's important to create the context so you can understand what I'm discussing this morning.

40
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,720
 Let me move to the second phase of what I'd like to present, and that is the National

41
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,640
 UFO Reporting Center, founded, as I mentioned earlier, in October 1974 by my predecessor

42
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,360
 as director in that capacity.

43
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,040
 His name is Robert J. Gribble, a retired Seattle fireman who had a lifelong interest in the

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:18,600
 subject of UFOs, and in July of 1994 he turned over the reins to me, and I think I can honestly

45
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,480
 report to the committee that it's changed my life and changed my outlook on what reality

46
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,400
 may be.

47
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,920
 The UFO Reporting Center has a hotline, rings 24 hours a day.

48
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,840
 We also have a website, ufocenter.com, where over the course of the last 19 years I've

49
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,680
 accumulated approximately 86,000 written reports.

50
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,800
 I estimate that that represents roughly one-third of the reports that have been submitted to

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,280
 our center.

52
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,560
 What I would like to do, and my gratitude to Congressman Bartlett, he gave me a wonderful

53
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,520
 opportunity yesterday when he made his I think commendable statement alluding to the press

54
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:11,160
 and the perceived lassitude there and how they behave with regard to the issue of ufology.

55
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,800
 What I would like to do, Mr. Chairman, with the remainder of my time is walk through a

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 six-page document that I've submitted to the committee and respond to the question that

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,480
 Mr. Bartlett posed certainly rhetorically and perhaps tacitly yesterday.

58
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,120
 Where is the press?

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,060
 Where are all the reports?

60
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,440
 And my hope is in about seven or eight minutes the committee will understand a little bit

61
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,680
 better the reality, the apparent reality that we are dealing with in addressing the issue

62
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,600
 of UFOs.

63
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:51,880
 If the committee could please turn to page one of the document listing a number of reports,

64
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,000
 out of deference to the chair, I would like to start with a report from the state of Alaska

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,280
 from the year 1936.

66
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,600
 And this goes back to a question that Congressman Cook posed I believe in the late morning of

67
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
 Monday of this week.

68
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,000
 He said where are all the reports from past years, and I'd like to address that.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,120
 Eklutna, Alaska, October 1936.

70
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,080
 Two teenage boys working in that city of Alaska, at that time no doubt a small city, were employees

71
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,280
 of the CCC, Civilian Conservation Corps, building a camp there.

72
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,960
 They decided to hitchhike into Anchorage, Alaska as they were walking towards Anchorage

73
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,680
 hoping to get a ride into that city.

74
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,720
 They encountered an object that looked roughly something like a flat iron, Mr. Holger Berg,

75
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,260
 one of those teenagers, reported to me in September of year 2000.

76
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:59,640
 They were walking towards Anchorage, they noticed a light coming directly at them.

77
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,800
 They were relieved because it was cold in October of that year and they thought it was

78
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,400
 a truck with only one headlight.

79
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,720
 Lo and behold, it turned out allegedly to be something else.

80
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,040
 It was a triangular craft that passed right overhead, scared them so badly that they dove

81
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,880
 into a snow bank to get away from it.

82
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,880
 Next case, McMinnville, Tennessee.

83
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,400
 Questions have been posed before this committee and the committee has commented do UFOs ever

84
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
 crash?

85
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,880
 They have malfunctions.

86
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,560
 On the 7th of January, 1995, precisely that seems to have occurred over the city of McMinnville,

87
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
 Tennessee.

88
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,200
 A fleet of objects seemed descending over the airport in McMinnville.

89
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,520
 For several minutes, one of them appears to have blown up.

90
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,080
 Tonight, during my longer presentation at 9 p.m., I will show the five-page handwritten

91
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,380
 document prepared by an investigating officer of what happened there.

92
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,280
 If the committee would please turn to page 2, I would like to for a moment address the

93
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,760
 issue of the Phoenix Lights case.

94
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,640
 Quite a celebrated case, probably the most dramatic UFO event that has occurred in the

95
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,520
 history of ufology since 1947.

96
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,700
 Just briefly, the five objects that loitered over the city of Phoenix for upwards of two

97
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,680
 hours were not less than seven miles in diameter.

98
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,920
 I will present evidence tonight showing why we believe that is the case and how we calculated

99
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,680
 the size of them.

100
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:44,080
 Next case, Longview, Washington, an elk, an adult female elk lifted out of the forest

101
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,800
 of the state of Washington before 14 witnesses at about one minute before noon.

102
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,880
 We have reported that.

103
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,000
 I have had witnesses on multiple radio programs talking about that, about that case.

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,600
 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, October 26, 1999, two airline pilots over the Dallas-Fort Worth

105
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,480
 area were shocked to see a large disk approaching their aircraft.

106
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,560
 It suddenly turned, it executed the estimated 120-degree turn in under one second, it streaked

107
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,480
 away from them to the east.

108
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,520
 We have the audio tape from the FAA through a Freedom of Information Act request.

109
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,440
 If the committee would please turn to page three.

110
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,720
 About two-thirds of the way down that page, Chalice, Idaho, September 27, year 2000, 2130

111
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,440
 hours mountain time.

112
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,360
 Four hunters were in a remote hunting camp near Chalice, Idaho, about an hour and a half

113
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,380
 drive outside that city.

114
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:58,220
 One of the men exited the trailer that they were in to secure food for dinner that night.

115
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:04,280
 He was shocked by what he saw hovering above their camp, a triangular craft, dark.

116
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:11,840
 His flashlight as he jumped up on the back end of his pickup truck swept across the sky.

117
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,520
 What he saw above him shocked him so badly that he fell to his knees and started yelling.

118
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,940
 Three of the others in the trailer came out and they observed the object suddenly slowly

119
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,680
 move off, go up the side of a nearby mountain range, go over the top of it.

120
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,280
 A very dramatic case, and if the committee would like documentation of that case, I would

121
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:40,000
 call upon Mrs. Howe at the end of the table who was present at the testimony of two of

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,560
 those witnesses.

123
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,160
 She later brought them to a radio program.

124
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,360
 Next case I would like to address briefly is that of Cartourette, New Jersey on the

125
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,800
 top of page four.

126
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:00,240
 Very dramatic case in which certainly dozens, possibly hundreds of cars were parked on the

127
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,880
 New Jersey turnpike in response to a cluster of yellow objects that were hovering above

128
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,520
 that turnpike.

129
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,760
 Just seconds earlier they had been reported from Fort Dix, New Jersey to be streaking

130
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,840
 across that military facility.

131
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:25,120
 Within seconds they were probably 70 or 80 miles to the east, and it was reported by

132
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,880
 many hundreds of people.

133
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,800
 Moving down further on page four, the location, Andrews Air Force Base, Waldorf, Maryland,

134
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,920
 Mr. Richard Dolan first alluded to this case on the morning of Monday this week.

135
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:50,640
 A blue object, there's an error in the citation, I think Mr. Dolan reported it accurately however,

136
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:58,880
 a blue object seen streaking over Waldorf, Maryland on that date, July 26, the year 2002,

137
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,520
 being pursued by two F-16 fighters.

138
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,560
 Just later it was seen returning the opposite direction, also pursued by those same fighters,

139
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,240
 a very, very interesting case.

140
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:19,120
 The case below it, Meriwether County, Georgia, April 13, 2003, three people driving in a

141
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,980
 closed vehicle.

142
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:29,280
 The driver was shocked to see a group, a cluster of red objects pursuing his vehicle.

143
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,240
 Apparently those tiny objects, perhaps the size of golf balls, allegedly, reportedly

144
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
 were inside his vehicle.

145
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,040
 They stayed in the vehicle for an estimated 20 to 30 seconds.

146
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,040
 Suddenly all of them coalesced around one of the occupants of the vehicle, the older

147
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,280
 brother of the two brothers.

148
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:59,000
 This gentleman had had a tragically intestinal surgery just a few days earlier, had a colostomy.

149
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,800
 All of the objects in the car assembled around the surgical scar on the lower abdomen of

150
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,120
 this gentleman.

151
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,180
 Within seconds they suddenly streaked off, interestingly, through the closed windows

152
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,600
 of the vehicle.

153
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,300
 I've had three of those people, those three witnesses on an international radio program

154
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,400
 talking about their experience.

155
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:33,200
 If the committee could please turn to page five, Seattle, Washington, June 20, 2004,

156
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,760
 an adult male standing outside in the University District of Seattle was shocked to see a triangular

157
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:46,360
 craft suddenly streak across the cloudless blue sky, very, very dramatic sighting.

158
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,860
 Others reported it to the National UFO Reporting Center.

159
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,920
 That case has been on our website for the last 13 years.

160
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,680
 Going down to a case at the bottom of page five, the O'Hare Airport case of November

161
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,680
 7, 2006, Mr. Dolan, Richard Dolan, alluded to this case earlier in the week's testimony,

162
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,360
 a very, very dramatic case, a disc estimated to be some 30 to 40 feet in diameter hovering

163
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:26,520
 above gate C-17 at O'Hare Airport, seen for perhaps as long as 10 minutes or even longer.

164
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,160
 I cite the case because of the drama surrounding it.

165
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,720
 That object was in what used to be called terminal control airspace, now called Class

166
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,080
 B airspace.

167
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,400
 Nothing should have been there over that airport.

168
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,760
 And it was suddenly seen to accelerate, as Mr. Dolan reported earlier in the week.

169
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:53,880
 It punched through two layers of solid overcast, leaving holes in the overcast, a very interesting

170
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,840
 and dramatic case, reported on national news, interestingly.

171
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:06,720
 Turning to the last page, if we could please, page six, Chicago, Illinois, November 4, year

172
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,320
 2008, I will be presenting evidence on this case to include photographs of the very peculiar

173
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,600
 damage that a young woman's car sustained.

174
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,080
 We cannot demonstrate clearly or to everybody's satisfaction that the case is UFO related,

175
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:31,660
 but I will present the evidence tonight during my presentation at 9 p.m., very, very interesting

176
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,620
 case of the mutilation of a car.

177
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,960
 I will leave it at that until I'm able to show the photographs.

178
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:50,240
 I'd like to close by citing a number of interesting cases that have been submitted to our center

179
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,240
 over the last roughly 10 months.

180
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,960
 We all are questing to know what all of this means and what's going on.

181
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,880
 The phenomenon appears to be very real.

182
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:09,420
 But in June of last year, 2012, the National UFO Reporting Center began receiving reports

183
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,560
 that I certainly do not understand.

184
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,480
 I don't believe anybody does, but the second week of June last year, and all of this information

185
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:27,080
 can be seen on the website, ufocenter.com, we started receiving reports, credible reports

186
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:35,000
 from credible witnesses of clusters of red, orange, yellow, amber, or gold lights, up

187
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,240
 to 150 in a cluster from around the world.

188
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,760
 I've written several articles.

189
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,120
 We have several statements on our home page about this phenomenon.

190
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,280
 It's very interesting, and in my opinion, it may represent the fact that we may have

191
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:56,920
 rounded the corner, so to speak, in the field of ufology when it comes to the dramatic nature

192
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,600
 of many of the reports that are coming to us.

193
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,680
 What the cause of these sightings is, we have no idea.

194
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,200
 But we have roughly 2,000 to 3,000 of these sightings posted to our website.

195
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,640
 If members of the committee would like to see details, I would commend to their attention

196
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:22,080
 the roughly 38 cases that were submitted to our facility on Saturday night, the 10th of

197
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,800
 November, year 2012.

198
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,720
 One of those cases on page 6 of your handout is that of Castle Rock.

199
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,440
 I cite that case because it was a report that was submitted to our center by a commercial

200
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,240
 airline pilot, retired, 37 years of experience.

201
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:50,000
 Driving east from Interstate 5, this is about 70 miles north of the city of Portland, driving

202
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,760
 east on Highway 504, what he saw frightened him so badly that he stopped his car on the

203
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,800
 way, turned it around and went back the other direction to get his camera and his wife.

204
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,480
 It's a very, very dramatic case, again, one of roughly 38 cases.

205
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,320
 An hour and 12 minutes later, a retired United States Marine Corps officer and his wife encountered

206
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:22,760
 something very similar in the city of Los Angeles.

207
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:29,240
 So in conclusion, Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentlemen, the question has been posed,

208
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,880
 is the UFO phenomenon real?

209
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,800
 And I pose to you the question that if it is not real, why have all of these reports

210
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,680
 been submitted over the last roughly 19 years?

211
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,760
 The UFO phenomenon appears to be very real.

212
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:53,160
 And I would like to conclude in responding to the very prescient question that Congressman

213
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,080
 Bartlett posed yesterday at about 3.05 p.m., where is the press and where are all of the

214
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,960
 reports?

215
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,760
 Very good question, and it's a question that every serious-minded UFO investigator poses

216
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,000
 to himself probably multiple times a day.

217
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,440
 I'd like to address the issue of the press.

218
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,880
 Many people have asked the question, why is the press responding apparently so strangely

219
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
 to this phenomenon?

220
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,560
 And from my vantage point, it's really a little bit different than that.

221
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:33,560
 I would split the press into two categories at least, the local, regional press and the

222
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,200
 national press.

223
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,200
 From my observation, and I've had hundreds of interchanges, exchanges of information

224
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,740
 with members of the press.

225
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,920
 The interesting phenomenon is, members of the local or regional press are questing for

226
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
 this data.

227
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,880
 A week doesn't go by when I don't get three to five queries from members of the local

228
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,260
 press, smaller newspapers, radio and television stations.

229
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:07,720
 But interestingly, when one gets to the national level, the interest seems to simply expire.

230
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,160
 A very peculiar phenomenon, but it tells us that people who are professional writers,

231
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,160
 who are professional reporters, are very interested in this phenomenon.

232
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:26,840
 And I close with a brief comment about the government's apparent position on this phenomenon.

233
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,440
 The government knows about this phenomenon.

234
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,100
 There is no doubt about it.

235
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:39,440
 I've had multiple exchanges, multiple conversations with all sorts of people who are in positions

236
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,600
 of authority in federal, state and local government.

237
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:53,200
 Many of them admit that they accept the fact that this is potentially a very real phenomenon.

238
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:03,080
 I've talked to military officers, senior officers, general or flagship officers, flag officers,

239
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:09,000
 who in quiet conversations have admitted to me that they are very interested in this phenomenon

240
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,360
 and in their opinion there is very real evidence in support of what this committee is addressing

241
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,800
 in these hearings this week.

242
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,440
 It appears that we are being visited on a frequent basis.

243
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,080
 The evidence supports it strongly in my opinion.

244
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,900
 And with that, I will close.

245
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,400
 I think my time has expired.

246
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
 Exactly.

247
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Thank you very much.

248
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 It has expired.

249
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Thank you.

250
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,560
 I want to underscore a different style from my personal point of view.

251
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,040
 I do not intend to interrupt any of the speakers.

252
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:59,000
 You're aware of the time and when it goes over and your testimony is very good, it will

253
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 continue.

254
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 However, you have to self-discipline yourself and in case you have problems with that, you

255
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,520
 just look at me and when I'm doing like that, that means wind it up intelligently so that

256
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,960
 you look good.

257
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,880
 And I want to commend you, Mr. Davenport, you have a great political style and that

258
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,000
 is when you're going over, you repeat that you're going to close in about three or four

259
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 times.

260
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I do apologize, Mr. Chairman.

261
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 That's okay.

262
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,080
 I shouldn't have noticed the time card and I was so focused on...

263
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
 You stay focused.

264
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,400
 Stay focused on your message.

265
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
 We'll worry about the time.

266
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,960
 But we appreciate your testimony.

267
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,520
 Mr. Robbins, the floor is yours and we'll allow you the same latitude.

268
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:49,220
 But keep in mind that when we're biting into time, we're biting into our time to question

269
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:56,880
 you and to have a discourse that may be more germane to our particular interest.

270
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,800
 So discipline yourself and Mr. Robbins, please go forward and I won't interrupt you unless

271
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 I have to.

272
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 I'll keep that in mind, Mr. Chairman.

273
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
 I apologize.

274
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,080
 Good morning, Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of our committee.

275
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,800
 I was only scheduled here to do this yesterday afternoon, so my opening statement is a bit

276
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,240
 rough at the edges.

277
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,600
 I've been involved in the field of UFO studies for more than 30 years as a researcher, lecturer,

278
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,240
 activist, consultant, author, and conference organizer.

279
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,840
 I've consulted to numerous television and radio shows, films, appear on radio regularly

280
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,920
 commenting about these subjects, write a column, actually a new one that will be starting in

281
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,520
 June for a new online magazine called UFO Truth, published by my friend and colleague

282
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,960
 to my right, Gary Hazeltine.

283
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,720
 I'm also the co-author of a 540-page book that was a bestseller in the United Kingdom

284
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:10,160
 entitled Left at East Gate, a first-hand account of the Rendlesham Forest UFO investigation,

285
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,880
 Rendlesham Forest UFO incident, its cover-up and investigation.

286
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:23,200
 For these 30 years that I have pursued this subject, I have done it on a number of fronts,

287
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,360
 always doing my utmost to approach each new case, witness claim, research paper, or interview

288
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,840
 free of prejudice or agenda.

289
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:40,160
 My only objective being to get myself and my readers as close as possible to the truth

290
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:47,240
 of what I've been looking into, limited only by my investigative skills, means, and applying

291
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,360
 as much common sense as possible wherever possible.

292
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,680
 Before proceeding, however, I feel I should put on the record that I am self-trained as

293
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:05,600
 an investigative writer, and if anyone in these hearings has a background more opposite

294
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,920
 than my friend and colleague Peter Davenport, it's me.

295
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,240
 I began my professional life as a painter and film historian.

296
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,240
 I taught painting in New York City for many years at my alma mater, the School of Visual

297
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:27,440
 Arts, and as I developed as a writer, I supported myself continuing as an artist, as a manager

298
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,400
 of a distinguished repertory theater company in New York City, as a New York City tour

299
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,640
 guide and as a copywriter.

300
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,800
 I also worked for eight of those years as an online phone volunteer and shift supervisor

301
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,480
 on the busiest crisis intervention and suicide hotline in the United States.

302
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,760
 Some may feel that such an eclectic and decidedly unrelated background may not be much of an

303
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,360
 asset in the field I ultimately choose to pursue.

304
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,640
 I can only beg to differ.

305
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,000
 Subjects I've chosen to investigate have included, but not been limited to, the origins

306
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,720
 of the UFO ridicule factor, roadblocks on the path to disclosure, the United Kingdom's

307
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,700
 Rendlesham Forest Incident, the strange death of James Vincent Forrestal, First Secretary

308
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:27,160
 of Defense, as some of you know, and an early casualty of UFO secrecy, at least that are

309
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:36,680
 my conclusions, critical thinking, deductive reasoning and ufology, stress and UFO studies,

310
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:45,080
 the UFO abduction phenomena, and UFOs, organized religion and fundamentalist thinking.

311
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:52,080
 As this morning's discussion topic is listed as various topics, I believe I qualify.

312
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,200
 While I stand ready to try and answer any questions to the best of my ability this committee

313
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,320
 may have, I'd particularly like to invite you to focus in on two of these particular

314
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,560
 areas of study.

315
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,860
 On the so-called UFO ridicule factor, we now know for a fact the subject of UFOs and their

316
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,880
 implications have been regarded as extremely serious by our military and intelligence communities

317
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,080
 from at least the summer of 1947 on.

318
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,640
 More seriously, in fact, than any other matter facing this nation since the end of World

319
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,400
 War II.

320
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:35,240
 Why then have the overwhelming majority and Mr. Davenport hit the nail on the head?

321
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:42,800
 We divide the media's general relationship with the subject of UFOs into two areas.

322
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:50,320
 Local and regional news gatherers are overall very serious, inquisitive, and genuinely respectful

323
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,240
 of this mystery.

324
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,920
 Major media has singled this subject out for a level of ridicule, sarcasm, and condescension

325
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,520
 matched in post-war journalism.

326
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:09,400
 How and why did all of this come to pass, and what is its legacy for the American people?

327
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,160
 The second subject is one you were introduced to during yesterday morning's hearings.

328
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,720
 That is the UK's Rendlesham Forest UFO incident.

329
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,280
 I first heard of these events in the autumn of 1983, shortly after the story broke in

330
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,840
 Great Britain.

331
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,120
 The following year I met and chatted briefly with Larry Warren, the former United States

332
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,280
 Air Force security police officer, who had completely on his own, and to a degree at

333
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,920
 great risk, certainly to his peace of mind and character, become the whistleblower in

334
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,560
 this case, was directly responsible for the FOIA that resulted in the release of Colonel

335
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,000
 Halt's January 1981 report, which was then published in England in '83 and the story

336
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,640
 broke.

337
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,920
 Four years later we met again at a conference not far from here, at American University

338
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,620
 in Washington.

339
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,000
 I was very impressed with his presentation.

340
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,520
 Fully authentic military witnesses who can be fully vetted and prove their involvement

341
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,600
 are not all that common.

342
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,560
 You've had the privilege of hearing several of them yesterday afternoon.

343
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,200
 I decided I wanted to interview this guy.

344
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,800
 He decided after hearing me on a panel discussion, he wanted me to co-author a book with him.

345
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,400
 We met the next weekend, talked all weekend, and by that Sunday afternoon we shook hands

346
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,760
 and I was very excited.

347
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,840
 I was going to be writing a book.

348
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,320
 I was looking for a serious project to get my teeth into.

349
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,360
 I thought it might take a year or two, obviously result in a huge best seller movie deal, many

350
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,240
 checks to endorse, and women to fight off.

351
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,880
 Life does not always work out the way you think.

352
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,280
 The book took 10 years to complete.

353
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,400
 It cost us everything we had.

354
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,960
 It cost me to a great degree my peace of mind.

355
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,600
 It's brought me back to England since more than 20 times.

356
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,500
 I had no idea of what I was getting into, but when we completed it, it was a best seller

357
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,320
 in the United Kingdom.

358
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,800
 It was immediately in the library of the then new Prime Minister Tony Blair, one of our

359
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:28,600
 greatest champions in the United Kingdom, became former Admiral of the Fleet, former

360
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,760
 Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense, Lord Peter Hill Norton, who as an MP brought

361
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,640
 his hardcover copy onto the book of the floor of House of Lords and confronted the then

362
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,320
 Secretary for Defense with four questions taken right out of the book, all of which

363
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:55,120
 were demured, when my co-author lost his passport, the State Department refusing to renew it

364
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,720
 for "speaking out on sensitive defense issues in a public forum on foreign soil."

365
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,120
 It was nobody less than former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who pro bono helped us restore

366
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,480
 Larry's passport and continue our work.

367
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,800
 The men who were involved in this as witnesses, and it was only touched on yesterday, were

368
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,040
 put through absolute hell.

369
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,080
 Some of the things that were done to the more unconscionable as far as I'm concerned, and

370
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,540
 this is of more interest and focus for me than whatever the source of the intelligences

371
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,280
 behind the events of December 1980.

372
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:38,600
 I applaud John and Jim for fighting for the truth to come out about this.

373
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:45,960
 I think all of these men are still struggling, and in fact, we are all clear in former deputy

374
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,960
 base commanders Charles Halt's terminology that these men were meddled with, and in some

375
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,160
 cases are still sorting out implanted memories from actual ones.

376
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,440
 Hence comes a certain amount of contention within this case that continues 33 years after.

377
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,400
 I hope I can clarify some of it fast, and again thank you for the privilege of appearing

378
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,400
 before you.

379
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:21,680
 Your timing is excellent, Mr. Robbins.

380
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,800
 Next witness is Gary Hazeltine.

381
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 Hazeltine.

382
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
 Hazeltine.

383
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
 Thank you.

384
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,560
 Good morning, and I will not go over 10 minutes of my practice.

385
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,840
 My name is Gary Hazeltine, and I am a recently retired police detective in England, having

386
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,840
 served almost 24 years with the British Transport Police.

387
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,080
 For the majority of that time, for 20 years, I was a detective.

388
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,760
 I was dealing at the sharp end of evidential matters, having been involved in murder, manslaughter,

389
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,360
 rape, et cetera, et cetera.

390
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,480
 I come to this subject on an evidential basis, and I think that is very necessary in this

391
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,960
 field.

392
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,760
 I am here principally to speak on behalf of police officers worldwide who have witnessed

393
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,240
 UFOs, but I would also like to say that I am also one of the principal investigators

394
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,560
 of the Rendlesham Forest incident that my colleague, Peter, has alluded to, along with

395
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
 Linda Moulton-Howe.

396
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,880
 I would consider her as the three principal investigators of this incident.

397
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,040
 We're all doing very good work on it.

398
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,560
 For the last five years, I have worked with Colonel Charles Holt, the man who wrote the

399
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,520
 Holt memorandum, the deputy base commander, of what was absolutely a nuclear facility.

400
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,920
 And let me back that up by saying that for three years of my six years in the Royal Air

401
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:43,480
 Force, between 1983 and 1989, I served on two nuclear bases doing exactly the same job

402
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,360
 as what those U.S. Air Force policemen did, and the base at Bentwater is identical to

403
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,800
 the base that I was in West Germany where I worked.

404
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,680
 Let's cut the crap.

405
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,480
 This is a nuclear issue.

406
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
 Right.

407
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,240
 In January 2002, moving to my police background, I created the Police Reporting UFO Sightings

408
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
 Database.

409
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,300
 It's commonly referred to as the Proof Force Police Database.

410
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,920
 You have an information pack with that information.

411
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:18,960
 It's basically there for U.K. police officers to record on- and off-duty police sightings.

412
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,760
 Believe me, over the 11 years of my research, nothing will surprise me what anybody says

413
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,160
 in this field about what they report.

414
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,040
 It is truly extraordinary.

415
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,500
 When I began my research 11 years ago into British police officers, there were approximately

416
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,760
 six cases involving 10 officers.

417
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:46,700
 Eleven years later, I now have over 425 cases involving over 940 British police officers.

418
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,320
 This is a significant amount, in my opinion.

419
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,140
 These sightings have taken place the length and breadth of Britain and have been reported

420
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,640
 at all times of the day.

421
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,480
 Whilst I'm not a big lover of statistics because they can be manipulated, I would say that

422
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:10,600
 the key statistic for me is that over 70 percent of these cases are multiple witness officer

423
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
 cases.

424
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,360
 Therefore, it is significant corroboration to a sighting event—again, I look at this

425
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,000
 case through evidential eyes.

426
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,360
 In one particular case, there is in excess of 24 police officers that were involved in

427
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:34,160
 tracking at least one object over six counties of Britain on the night of March 30, 31, 1993.

428
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,760
 This is referred to as the Cosford Incident.

429
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,800
 Many police officers have observed structured craft of huge size and proportions in close

430
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,740
 proximity to their ground positions.

431
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:52,480
 These craft range in shape and size and dimensions from many tens of feet to many hundreds of

432
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
 feet in size.

433
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,040
 Many of the police cases on the database, in my opinion, are truly extraordinary.

434
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:08,400
 For example, in October 1984 near Arief North Alton Middlesex, a silent black triangular

435
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,680
 object was seen at low altitude by two uniformed police officers on mobile patrol wallet, which

436
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,080
 they described as being the size of three football fields.

437
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:25,400
 When I sought to clarify this description of size, they said when they saw it, it was

438
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,400
 above three football fields.

439
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,080
 I think that's pretty good representation of size.

440
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,560
 This report was made by Police Constable Robin Perry of the Metropolitan Police.

441
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,840
 On another occasion in October 1978, three uniformed police officers in a rural area

442
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,120
 of Buckinghamshire observed a huge object, which they described as a size of a football

443
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:54,320
 field, which suddenly and silently materialized in front of them in the blink of an eye and

444
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,200
 at relative close proximity to their position.

445
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,800
 However, there were also a number of smaller objects flying around the large main object

446
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:09,240
 akin to a mothership kind of scenario, and the larger object then projected a beam down

447
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,480
 to the ground, which was the width of the football field, which then traversed the ground

448
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,560
 as if scanning the terrain for several minutes.

449
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:24,480
 They watched this event for approximately five minutes before suddenly it went off and

450
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,640
 then dematerialized in the blink of an eye.

451
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,320
 One second it was there, and then it was gone.

452
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,160
 This has been described as like switching on a light bulb on and off, not something

453
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,900
 that I think our stealth capability is quite capable of yet.

454
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:47,160
 The source of that report is the Police Constable Eric Raymond, retired of the Thames Valley

455
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,400
 Police.

456
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,280
 Many officers have seen objects that appear to move in ways that seem to defy our laws

457
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,000
 of known physics and aerodynamics.

458
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:04,040
 For example, in May 1981 and 1982, two firearms officers were involved in the close protection

459
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:12,280
 of what was then a very prominent conservative minister in a rural location in North Yorkshire.

460
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,400
 At approximately 5.30 hours in the morning, as they were walking in the grounds of this

461
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,040
 residence, they suddenly became aware that the sunshine had darkened, the sky had darkened.

462
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,600
 And they looked up to establish the cause of that.

463
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:32,600
 They were amazed to see a huge, dark, purple, cylindrical object with a pronounced undercarriage

464
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,640
 underneath it that was described as being the length of a football field, a common figure

465
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,560
 in all of this, and hovering silently above the house at an altitude of only two to three

466
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,800
 hundred feet, which is extremely close.

467
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,040
 The object remained motionless, silent above the house for five to ten minutes before it

468
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:59,600
 suddenly and silently accelerated in the blink of an eye out to the horizon, where it stopped

469
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:05,040
 in an instant for a few seconds and then disappeared towards the horizon and out of sight.

470
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,600
 The source of this report is police sergeant retired John Pawson of the North Yorkshire

471
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,000
 Police.

472
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,880
 In my introduction, I mentioned that I would refer to police officer sightings worldwide.

473
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,480
 And in the time permitted, I would like to draw your attention to just two particular

474
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,320
 countries where numerous police officer sightings have taken place.

475
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,480
 Namely, I refer to the United States and Belgium.

476
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,080
 Many of the U.S. cases are simply outstanding, and I will highlight just two of them.

477
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:38,440
 Just after midnight on the 14th of December 1994, fifteen police officers of Trumbull

478
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:45,600
 County, Ohio, observed multiple circular UFOs from different geographical positions.

479
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,480
 In one particular sighting, the engine of the police vehicle driven by Sergeant Toby

480
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,240
 Mollero suddenly cut out.

481
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,800
 When he got out of the vehicle, he looked up and a UFO was directly above him shining

482
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,320
 a beam down.

483
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,620
 As soon as the object moved away, his engine restarted and he attempted a short pursuit.

484
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:10,200
 On the 5th of January 2000 in Illinois, multiple police officers observed a large triangular

485
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,500
 craft that was witnessed from many geographical positions and were sometimes seen at close

486
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,040
 proximity to their ground locations.

487
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,360
 Broadly speaking, all the officers involved in both of these incidents described crafts

488
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,720
 that moved in silence which were able to make incredibly high speed maneuvers unlike that

489
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,800
 of any known aircraft.

490
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:38,040
 Finally, in the skies above Belgium between 1989 and 1991, hundreds of police officers

491
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,580
 observed large triangular objects all over the country.

492
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,920
 Many of these sightings involved multiple police officer witnesses and were frequently

493
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,180
 seen at close proximity to their ground locations.

494
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:55,320
 In addition, many of these sightings were confirmed on multiple civilian radar and multiple

495
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,640
 military radar facilities.

496
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,080
 In the allotted ten minutes given to brief you, which I'm trying to keep to, I would

497
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:08,880
 like to say on behalf of police officers worldwide that they are seeing actual structured craft,

498
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:16,920
 physical in nature and which move in ways that they have never seen before or since.

499
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,800
 In closing, I urge this panel to accept their collective testimonies as genuine and that

500
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:32,120
 they offer compelling circumstantial evidence that many of these sightings represent extraordinary,

501
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,200
 unknown structured craft moving in the Earth's airspace.

502
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:43,020
 In closing and on a personal note, I believe that the time is now to lift the veil of secrecy

503
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:48,720
 that has shrouded this subject for over 60 years and the subject of UFOs should now be

504
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:56,440
 openly accepted in the mainstream media as being real in nature and which in turn would

505
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,800
 allow people to come forward from all walks, all life, all countries without the fear of

506
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,440
 ridicule and a risk to their careers.

507
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,360
 As a police detective of many years' service, I believe that the collective testimonial

508
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:20,080
 documentary and physical evidence obtained in over 60 years of UFO research overwhelmingly

509
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:27,400
 confirms that some, and I repeat the word some, UFO sightings do represent an ongoing

510
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,480
 extraterrestrial engagement with planet Earth.

511
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,200
 I am deeply honoured to be here before you today and thank you, the panel, for being

512
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,680
 courageous in coming forward at probably some cost to yourselves in your reputation, but

513
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,720
 you are and whether the mainstream media are here or not, this is historic and it will

514
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:54,560
 be looked back as an historic event and you will be congratulated in time for your participation.

515
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
 Thank you.

516
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:13,680
 Thank you very much, investigative detective, I just want to underscore that your passion

517
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:21,440
 really underscores the significance of your testimony and that's a worthy, it's a virtue.

518
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,360
 Now we come to our last panelist for this round, who's graced us with her, she doesn't

519
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,320
 have her little hat today, but...

520
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,320
 It's not raining.

521
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,320
 It's not, okay.

522
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,320
 It's not raining.

523
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
 Very good.

524
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:43,160
 Well, great to have you back, Ms Hall, please.

525
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,320
 Because I'm going to talk about a subject that is perhaps one of the most difficult

526
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,800
 when it comes to the UFO phenomena, I thought I would give you a little bit more context

527
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,840
 about my background and to Jennifer, who is handling the slides, please wait until I call

528
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,800
 for them by number.

529
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:11,040
 My name is Linda Moulton Howe, my master's degree in communication is from Stanford University,

530
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:20,200
 Palo Alto, California in 1968, I attached a bio for you to my statement today.

531
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:26,560
 Since then, I have produced two dozen TV documentaries, including the regional Emmy Award, honored

532
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,840
 a strange harvest about the worldwide animal mutilation phenomena.

533
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:40,080
 And more than 100 live TV studio programs, science, environment, and medicine is my beat.

534
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,440
 I also produce, write, edit, and report the journalism award winning science, environment,

535
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,360
 and real X-Files news website, earthfiles.com.

536
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,160
 In addition, I am an investigative reporter for premier radio networks program Coast to

537
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:01,720
 Coast AM, reporting earth files, environment, science, and real X-Files news monthly in

538
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,520
 three hour broadcasts.

539
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:10,960
 Since 1990, I have produced a thousand new segments for radio broadcasts.

540
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:18,760
 My four books include An Alien Harvest, 1989, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume One, Facts

541
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:26,840
 and Eyewitnesses, 1993, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume Two, High Strangeness, 1998,

542
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,600
 Mysterious Lights, and Crop Circle, Second Edition, 2002.

543
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,680
 I have been asked to speak around the world as an investigative reporter at national and

544
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:46,180
 international conferences and symposiums, including NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

545
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,720
 And one of the subjects that I have been asked to talk about is all of the work that I have

546
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:56,860
 done in the investigation of animal mutilations around the world.

547
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:04,400
 The first global media report about this phenomena was in September of 1967 when a female horse

548
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,400
 named Lady was found dead on a ranch near Alamosa in southern Colorado.

549
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,720
 The horse's entire skull and long neck had been stripped of flesh and every organ in

550
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,780
 the chest of that horse had been surgically excised according to a medical doctor.

551
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:30,160
 There was no blood anywhere, not in the animal, not around the animal, and nowhere nearby.

552
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,600
 And there were no tracks of the animal.

553
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:39,160
 It was powdery soil and the animal is lying there stripped of flesh, but there were no

554
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,360
 tracks around the body, not even the own horse's tracks.

555
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:52,760
 But a hundred and some feet away there were horse tracks in a circle as if the horse had

556
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:59,960
 been caught in something in which the feet had gone around in a circle and then a hundred

557
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,600
 and some feet away the body was found.

558
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:18,840
 At that same time, and Jennifer, image 00, on July 15th, 1984, the Sunday Times in Australia

559
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:25,600
 headlined, quote, "Cover-up alleged over UFO-linked animal slaughter.

560
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:32,060
 Many reports of UFOs and strange lights in the sky," close quote, "Farmers in the Adelaide

561
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:37,440
 Hills have discovered mutilated animal corpses and burn marks on the ground.

562
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,920
 In one incident, researchers say a farmer discovered four cows with holes drilled into

563
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,440
 their skulls and the brains removed."

564
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,120
 Adelaide UFO researcher Colin Norris said, quote, "I have been told the Army asked the

565
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,680
 farmer to remain quiet about the animals and that the Army would cover the whole thing

566
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,040
 up," close quote.

567
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:07,120
 Mr. Norris said pod marks in the ground and burnt treetops indicated a UFO craft had landed.

568
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:16,800
 That was Australia in 1984, and we should have up that headline at 00.

569
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,280
 Yes.

570
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:24,160
 And Australia has played a very interesting role in this historically because the BBC

571
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,320
 in 1979, when I started the work on A Strange Harvest, there was a producer there who told

572
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:39,300
 me that they had a journal from 1911 that had been published about 104 sheep being found

573
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:48,480
 in an Australian billabong with an ear, eye, tongue, genitals, and rectum cored out, 104

574
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:56,080
 all in one billabong with no blood and no tracks around those animals either.

575
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,720
 Image 13.

576
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:06,400
 This map shows geographic areas where animal mutilations have been reported since 1967 at

577
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,680
 least, barring the fact that Australia has reported many before.

578
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:19,800
 By 2013, every state in the United States and every province in Canada have had bloodless

579
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,180
 large animal mutilations as well as other countries.

580
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,660
 No one knows for certain how many animals have been mutilated over the past half century

581
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:32,280
 in the United States and Canada and around the world.

582
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,880
 Many mutilated animals are not reported because ranchers are either afraid or do not want

583
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,240
 public attention and potential ridicule. Image 14.

584
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:48,880
 Beyond the United States and Canada, mutilated animals have been reported in Mexico, Panama,

585
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,600
 Puerto Rico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, parts of Europe, the Canary Islands, China, and

586
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,960
 Australia.

587
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,160
 Image 1.

588
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,480
 Excisions are not only smooth and bloodless, they can be serrated the way that pinking shears

589
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:10,160
 cut cloth for dressmakers, as was discovered in this two-year-old Hereford steer, the fifth

590
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,080
 mutilation on the Richard Fazio Ranch near Portland, Oregon, within a four-month period

591
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,760
 ending in October of 1990.

592
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,640
 Image 2.

593
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:26,080
 Here is a photograph of the uniformly serrated edge of the mutilator's bloodless excision

594
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:31,440
 that many people who have had these in their hands in the field say do look like some kind

595
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,560
 of pinking shears have cut the steers' tissue.

596
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,680
 Image 3.

597
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,600
 Here is a close-up of that particular serrated edge from the side in the 1990 Oregon steer

598
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:50,900
 serrated excision that an Oregon State University veterinary diagnostic laboratory reported

599
00:50:50,900 --> 00:51:00,920
 had been cut with high heat, image 5, consistent, and I'm reading now from the Oregon State

600
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:07,480
 University veterinary laboratory assessment, quote, "Consistent with a specimen collected

601
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,040
 via electrosurgical excision, it is not possible to tell whether this lesion was caused by

602
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,360
 a laser.

603
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:21,240
 It does appear consistent with a heat-induced injury," close quote, image 4.

604
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:27,320
 Here is another similar serrated edge found on a mutilated cow in 1975, we're going back

605
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,800
 almost 20 years, by the Cascade County Sheriff's Office in Great Falls, Montana.

606
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:39,200
 The issue of lasers came up early in the animal mutilation mystery because there was no blood.

607
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,120
 There had to have been some kind of cautery.

608
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:48,000
 But then I worked with John Altshuler, M.D. pathologist and hematologist in Denver, Colorado,

609
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,400
 going out to animal mutilation sites myself to collect tissue and fluid for him to study

610
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,800
 from the animals.

611
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:02,840
 One of his first confirmations was cooked hemoglobin in a mutilated cow, slide 6.

612
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:08,840
 Here is what normal cow collagen looks like under a microscope, image 7.

613
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:14,020
 And here is mutilated cow tissue in which the hemoglobin has been cooked by high heat

614
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,840
 at the excision site.

615
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:21,640
 Dr. Altshuler also showed me photomicrographs of the mutilator's excision in comparison

616
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,400
 with known laser surgery.

617
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:29,960
 Dr. Altshuler said, "The animal mutilation excisions do not show any carbon, but earth

618
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,680
 life is carbon based and all tissue exposed to the heat of a laser should show carbon

619
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,980
 residue that looks like black pepper grains under a microscope."

620
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:47,500
 We never found any carbon residue on mutilator excisions we studied, raising the question,

621
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,920
 what is the surgical instrument?

622
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,600
 Does it work by sound frequencies or some other technology unknown to earth medical

623
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,980
 science?

624
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,600
 Image 8.

625
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:03,640
 Here is a classic example of the bloodless removal of an udder from a cow that had just

626
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:10,100
 given birth in Ashdown, Arkansas, discovered on the morning of March 11, 1989.

627
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:18,200
 And I'm showing you -- letting you know, this is one of the cleanest kind of phenomena.

628
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:24,960
 The excision is there and the animal is not alive, but you can see how pristine the scenes

629
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,720
 are.

630
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:33,720
 The editor of the Little River News, Jim Williamson, contacted me and I called Dr. Altshuler who

631
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:38,680
 wanted Jim Williamson to cut a rectangle of cowhide that would include the mutilator's

632
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,680
 cut.

633
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,680
 Dr. Altshuler said, "Tissue slides from this cow quote prove that the cutting was done

634
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,600
 quickly with a hot instrument of some kind."

635
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:57,400
 He reported, "Examination of the tissues after fixation revealed cut edges to be very hard,

636
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,320
 difficult to cut, and appearing somewhat darker than the surrounding tissues, which does relate

637
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,820
 to high heat."

638
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,040
 Image 9.

639
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,940
 Photomicrograph number 1 has an arrow which points to the separation line.

640
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,920
 The abnormal tissue on the left shows a smudge pink change with nuclear fragmentation indicating

641
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,480
 tissue destruction and death.

642
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,000
 These changes are referred to as coagulative necrosis.

643
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,500
 The band between cutting margin and normal tissue is quite thin, suggesting that the

644
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:36,720
 dissection was done with what appears to be a pinpoint accuracy and minimal dissipation

645
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:45,200
 of heat at the cut line, "The heat is confined to a millimeter in these excisions."

646
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,960
 Image 10.

647
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,920
 This photomicrograph shows dark pinkish-blue parallel bundles of cells at the cut edge

648
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,360
 of the tissue.

649
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:58,880
 These changes are referred to as the string beans signed by a pathologist indicating tissue

650
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:05,760
 exposure to high heat, as in laser or hot needle surgery, but again, there is no carbon

651
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,800
 residue.

652
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,540
 Image 11.

653
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:14,120
 In this photomicrograph, the tissue is from below the hide surface and is called dermis.

654
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:19,840
 The upper portion clearly shows many spaces called vacuolar changes where the arrow is,

655
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:25,760
 which result from tissue cooking or exposure to high temperatures probably above 300 degrees

656
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,280
 Fahrenheit.

657
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,100
 Image 12.

658
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:34,500
 In the lower left-hand corner of this photomicrograph is a distinct color change from a light normal

659
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,520
 pink to a dark pink.

660
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:42,480
 The darker collagen tissue is damaged from some injury source, but shows a striking lack

661
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,680
 of inflammatory change.

662
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:50,240
 This suggests that the procedure of injury was relatively fast.

663
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:56,200
 Taking all the microscopic findings into account, one would have to conclude that the surgical

664
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:03,360
 procedure performed on these animals took place quickly, probably in a minute or two,

665
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:09,120
 and utilized high-temperature heat as a cutting source applied in a fine probe or cutting

666
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,000
 instrument, close quote.

667
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:19,680
 We are talking about the excision of an ear, eye, jaw flesh, tongue, the sexual organs,

668
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:28,400
 and the rectum in less than two minutes, leaving physical evidence that has been repeated myself.

669
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,840
 I have cut tissue from at least 30 of these animals in pastures all over the United States,

670
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,840
 and all of the findings are exactly the same.

671
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:44,800
 How do you excise large sections of tissue and leave the evidence of high heat without

672
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:52,160
 carbon residue, no blood, and no tracks around the animals, and do it in two minutes or less?

673
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:58,120
 Lynn Lauber, head of animal mutilation investigations at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Calgary

674
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:06,480
 Alberta in 1980, where the local Canadian media were told by the RCMP that the cause

675
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,360
 of the mutilations there in the hundreds were satanic cults.

676
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:18,360
 But Lynn Lauber called me at KMGH TV in Denver after the broadcast of my TV documentary,

677
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:24,360
 A Strange Harvest, and he said that he had seen my documentary, and he was calling me

678
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:31,400
 because, and this is what he said to me, he knew that something from outer space was involved

679
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,080
 in the mutilations that the RCMP in Canada had investigated.

680
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:42,760
 When I asked him why then have you told the media the perpetrators are satanic cults,

681
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:51,080
 he said the reason was that he felt the truth was too difficult to report publicly.

682
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:59,520
 And that to me sums up the metaphor of not just this 21st century or the 20th century,

683
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,920
 but this is a phenomena that I understand has been going on for thousands of years,

684
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,840
 and we are just catching up to it.

685
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:14,280
 And when Sheriff Tech's graves in September of 1979 in my very first interview with somebody

686
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,440
 in law enforcement about animal mutilations when I began doing A Strange Harvest, told

687
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:27,160
 me, Linda, the perpetrators are creatures from outer space, quote unquote, and I felt

688
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:31,800
 the same shock that perhaps you do.

689
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:38,640
 The truth is law enforcement has long known from their own eyewitness accounts they've

690
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,760
 seen the beams of light in pastures.

691
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,080
 Ranchers have seen the glowing disks put beams down.

692
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,960
 Ranchers have seen animals rise into these glowing disks.

693
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,960
 The glowing disks have been seen lowering animals down in beams of light to pastures

694
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,960
 where they are then mutilated.

695
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:07,480
 And to get those people, law enforcement or ranchers, to stand up in front of a camera

696
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:13,520
 and tell the world what they've seen with their own eyes is the biggest difficulty of

697
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:20,080
 my entire career because we are on a planet where humans are more afraid of humans and

698
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:25,440
 they're ridicule than they are of extraterrestrials.

699
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:32,320
 I am hoping that in this citizen hearing, a kind of exercise to what I hope will take

700
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,560
 place.

701
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:42,600
 All of this should be presented in a formal, executive, official congressional hearing

702
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:53,000
 of why has the agencies of the United States government, the Department of Justice, the

703
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:01,840
 FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the DIA, the NRO, they've all been studying this.

704
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,800
 They have more data than I do.

705
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:13,240
 Why shouldn't this country get back on the track of being of and by and for the people

706
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,440
 and that we should know exactly what those agencies know?

707
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,440
 Thank you.

708
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
 Thank you.

709
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:30,320
 Thank you all for your fine testimony.

710
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:36,760
 I'd like to yield to my colleague from the House, Mr. Bartlett.

711
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,720
 The floor is yours, sir.

712
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,520
 Thank you very much and thank you all very much for your testimony.

713
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:49,440
 Mr. Hickerton, you mentioned some concern expressed to you about the contribution of

714
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,440
 statistics.

715
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,440
 Yes.

716
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,520
 It reminded me when I was working on my doctorate, and that was a long time ago.

717
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,640
 I got it in 1952.

718
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,960
 I came in one morning and my major professor, Norman Phillips, said, "You know, Roscoe,

719
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,640
 there are three degrees of liars."

720
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,640
 I said, "Sir?"

721
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:09,360
 He said, "Yes, there are liars, there are damn liars, and there are statisticians."

722
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,880
 So that was his view of the problem.

723
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,600
 When I got home last night, my wife called me and she said, "There's somebody on the

724
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,040
 phone with a very heavy accent that wants to talk to you."

725
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,640
 So I went to the phone and it was somebody from the BBC.

726
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:30,680
 They said, "We understand that you're involved in a citizen's hearing in Washington, D.C.

727
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,160
 about extraterrestrials."

728
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:39,480
 I said, "Well, that's not quite my perception when I accepted the invitation to come to

729
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,960
 be a part of this citizen hearing."

730
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:50,760
 I thought to myself, "This is a bit like the elephant and the three blind men."

731
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,400
 One of them felt its broad side and said, "Gee, this is a wall."

732
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,720
 Another felt one of the legs and said, "This has to be a tree," and another felt the tail

733
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,480
 and said, "This is a rope or a vine."

734
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:08,720
 And so what you think these hearings are about depends, I guess, upon your context of your

735
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:16,520
 experience and what you had in your head when you came here.

736
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:24,680
 I knew before I came here that UFOs were a real subject, unidentified flying objects.

737
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:36,320
 Even the Air Force in their not very truthful fact sheet on closing down Project Blue Book

738
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:44,800
 admitted that there were 701 unidentified, that's what a UFO is, unidentified flying

739
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,800
 objects.

740
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,920
 Even the Air Force admits that there are unidentified flying objects.

741
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:57,920
 My interview on the BBC last evening ended with my question, "What are they?"

742
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:05,120
 There's clearly something out there that cannot be explained as beams of light or swamp gas

743
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,600
 or hallucinations or anything.

744
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:13,280
 When more than one person sees it from different angles, when there is a radar track, this

745
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,280
 is real.

746
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,880
 It's not something that you can argue away.

747
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:27,680
 My hope is, as a result of this hearing, that the media will, even if they believe that

748
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,920
 this is all crazy, that everyone who believes in, now I believe in UFOs.

749
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,560
 I'm not quite there yet that they're extraterrestrial.

750
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:42,500
 Maybe that's because I'm a scientist and I know that the closest possible place I'm told

751
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:47,320
 where there could be life is 37 light years away.

752
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,840
 What that means is unless they have some way of communicating faster than the speed of

753
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:56,920
 light it takes 74 years to ask a question and get an answer back.

754
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,480
 So obviously you can't be controlling something from that far away.

755
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:11,160
 Now, my forbearers, not very long ago since I am Anglo-Saxon, my forbearers not very long

756
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,840
 ago were running around Europe in animal skins in a stone age.

757
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,480
 So I have to be pretty arrogant and presumptuous to believe that there isn't somewhere out

758
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:25,440
 there in this huge universe some civilization more developed than mine.

759
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,360
 And I note that we still have these stupid wars and kill each other and there's got

760
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,760
 to be a civilization somewhere in this huge universe with a billion stars in our galaxy

761
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,700
 and a billion galaxies out there.

762
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:42,320
 The statistical probability that there is life somewhere else just has to be very, very

763
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,840
 high, doesn't it?

764
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:49,360
 I would hope that what comes of this hearing is that the press recognizes that here is

765
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:53,700
 an opportunity for some really interesting stories.

766
01:04:53,700 --> 01:05:00,560
 There is reporting out there and then after the reporting what is the explanation of it?

767
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:12,240
 I'm sure the Air Force thought that they could explain away nearly 12,000, 12,618 sightings.

768
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,480
 They explained away all but 701 of them.

769
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:21,160
 And there are a lot of sightings that are searchlights on clouds and that sort of thing.

770
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:27,480
 So it would make very interesting press I would think to report these sightings and

771
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,600
 then to report the analysis of the sighting.

772
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,220
 What did it mean?

773
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:38,800
 So the press doesn't have to buy in to extraterrestrials, they don't have to buy into any of this.

774
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:44,380
 They simply need to do what the press I think is supposed to do and that is report what's

775
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,040
 out there.

776
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:52,160
 And why wouldn't this make, you know, and they don't have to buy into the lunatic fringe,

777
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:57,560
 you know, if somebody cites something, somebody cites something, why not report it?

778
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,240
 They don't even report the sighting.

779
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,240
 They don't report anything.

780
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:07,880
 You know, you've told me about fairly recent sightings, I haven't heard any of that in

781
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,880
 the press.

782
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,160
 Now, a number of years ago there were mentions of that in the press.

783
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,800
 I mentioned the one time I was listening, I can't remember the year, it was quite some

784
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,640
 time ago, but you may be able to tell me what the year was by the confluence of the two

785
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,640
 events.

786
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,160
 One was sightings over New Mexico and the other was a report that two people had died

787
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,600
 in New York City from what might have been psittacosis, and if it was psittacosis it

788
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,760
 might have come from dried pigeon manures, so maybe we ought to kill all the pigeons

789
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,480
 in New York City.

790
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,520
 So I thought to myself, you know, with that kind of logic, if I was out there from somewhere

791
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:44,880
 else watching us, I think I'd want to watch a little longer before I contacted these people.

792
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,240
 I hope that that's what comes of this.

793
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,040
 As I say, you know, there are unidentified flying objects.

794
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,520
 I came here with an open mind.

795
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:58,760
 I'm not quite there yet that they're extraterrestrial because I'm not sure how they would control

796
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:04,800
 things when the closest possible life, I'm told, is 37 light years away.

797
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:11,840
 Now, you know, I couldn't imagine, my forebears couldn't imagine of the iPhones of today,

798
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,320
 so clearly there may be travel faster than the speed of light.

799
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:21,960
 There may be ways to communicate that we can't begin to understand, but, you know, the phenomenon

800
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,960
 is real.

801
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,960
 They are here.

802
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,840
 There are thousands of reportings, you know, and I will do everything I can.

803
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,120
 I think I have some credibility.

804
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:37,160
 I will try to do everything I can to convince the press that they -- there's some interesting

805
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,160
 stories here.

806
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,560
 You know, the story may be this guy's really a wacko, isn't he?

807
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,480
 He's reporting these crazy things.

808
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:48,280
 In any event, isn't there an interesting story to all of these sightings?

809
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,280
 There is something there.

810
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:56,640
 Why -- who has been successful in convincing the press that these are not reportable?

811
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:05,240
 Supposed to be a free press, free country, the truth out there.

812
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,200
 Why isn't it?

813
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,200
 Thank you very much.

814
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:19,600
 It's turning into a Senate hearing, you know, where we give our views, and of course, I'm

815
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,000
 guilty of that for the last two days.

816
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:35,360
 The next person to ask questions is Congresswoman Lynn Wolsey.

817
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,820
 Thank you.

818
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,200
 More interesting information.

819
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,560
 There's no question about it.

820
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:48,040
 I'd like to just add on to what Congressman Bartlett said.

821
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:52,160
 It's not just the press that needs to start bringing this forward.

822
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,920
 It's our government, and we know that.

823
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:03,120
 Maybe if our government will listen and investigate -- I mean, they're doing it somewhere probably,

824
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:09,760
 but if they'd bring it out in the open, that would make interesting press, and it would

825
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:16,520
 not be press libeled kooks, I don't believe.

826
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:22,640
 And I actually have questions, but I want to say, there's no kooks in this room, and

827
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:28,520
 I am so impressed with all of you, so thank you for letting me be part of it.

828
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:36,840
 Okay, Peter Davenport, you said that there's over 80,000 written reports and examples that

829
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:44,120
 you get, I mean, reports you get every year on your hotline and in your organization?

830
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:48,560
 We receive probably between 3,000 and 6,000 reports a year.

831
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,880
 We have, I think, 86,000 reports accumulated in our database.

832
01:09:52,880 --> 01:10:02,300
 Okay, well, give us an example or two of what somebody would call about that actually resulted

833
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:07,660
 in incredible action.

834
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,980
 Thank you for the question, Congresswoman Wilsey.

835
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,680
 I would go right to the Phoenix Lights case in response to your question, the most dramatic

836
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:23,920
 case that I've handled in my roughly 50, 60 years of investigating the UFO phenomenon.

837
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:30,920
 Again, the size of the objects was unimaginable by terrestrial standards.

838
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,120
 The triangular object that hovered for an estimated five minutes over the intersection

839
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:41,960
 of 7th Avenue and Indian School Road that night, again, this is March 13th, 1997, hovered

840
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,680
 there for five minutes.

841
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:50,840
 It subtended an arc of about 135 degrees from the vantage point of people on the ground.

842
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:56,600
 It was that large above their heads, at which time it was not less than 8,000 feet above

843
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,680
 ground level.

844
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:03,540
 The size of these objects by itself tells us that we're dealing with something extraordinary.

845
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:07,200
 That object was capable of hovering motionless for five minutes.

846
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:15,120
 So I'm going to ask you to talk about what came of that.

847
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:20,880
 So you discovered, you heard something, of something and it turned out to be something

848
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:27,040
 that people could see and what came of it?

849
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,920
 So why did it matter that we knew this?

850
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,520
 Well it appears that a very unusual event occurred.

851
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:39,360
 It's generated multiple books, six videotapes of various objects that night were taken.

852
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,480
 It was an extraordinary event that went largely unreported in the national press.

853
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,000
 It occurred on March 13th.

854
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:52,000
 The first national article in the USA Today did not appear until Wednesday the 18th of

855
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,360
 June that year.

856
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,400
 Was anybody harmed?

857
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,520
 Did anything happen to Arizona because of this?

858
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,760
 Not that I'm aware of.

859
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,120
 I think the full story is yet to be understood and I'm not sure we'll be able to obtain

860
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,520
 the full story.

861
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,640
 But about 1,500 witnesses submitted written reports.

862
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,440
 That's pretty good evidence by my standard.

863
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,720
 What did you do with those reports?

864
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,720
 Where did they go?

865
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,840
 Many of them are on our webpage.

866
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:28,320
 I think probably 100 or 150 eyewitness reports are posted there.

867
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,880
 Many of them are in the hands of investigators in Arizona.

868
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,880
 Thank you.

869
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,400
 Are you still following up?

870
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,520
 You don't just hand it to the investigators and say now it's yours?

871
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:47,940
 Well that is what I did in that instance because the National UFO Reporting Center technically

872
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,320
 speaking is not an investigative body.

873
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:54,160
 We're a conduit of information.

874
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:59,560
 Now to all of you, but you don't all have to answer if you hear the right answer from

875
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:03,240
 one of your colleagues on the panel.

876
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:14,840
 When it's not a UFO, this flying object, when it's not a UFO, what is it?

877
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,560
 I'll take that first.

878
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,680
 Any number of things Congresswoman.

879
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:26,640
 In fact most of us who try to do good work in this field are approached with surprising

880
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:32,680
 skepticism because we no longer have the luxury of disbelief so to say.

881
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:37,400
 It's been proved to us repeatedly in terms you could bring into a courtroom.

882
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:46,140
 We have to be particularly careful about not informing our examination.

883
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:56,140
 It's no secret that our government has produced flying aircraft that do not conform to the

884
01:13:56,140 --> 01:14:00,600
 notions that we grew up with that are terribly advanced and I don't have to tell the members

885
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:07,240
 of this committee that technologically where we are at the highest levels.

886
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:12,800
 So now and it's your understanding that those technologies aren't common knowledge?

887
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:18,520
 Oh I think they're common knowledge in popular culture but the specifics of the dynamics

888
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:24,440
 of these machines and what they're capable of for most intelligent people would mimic

889
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:29,520
 a machine from another planet or something.

890
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,360
 Also if you're predisposed to the subject or you're a believer or you're looking for

891
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:42,840
 these things, it can be a plane coming at a certain angle, it can under certain circumstances

892
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:52,160
 be a reflection from the ground, it can be a large assembly of balloons themselves that

893
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,160
 escape.

894
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,480
 There are any number of possibilities.

895
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:00,640
 The main thing is to paraphrase our friend and colleague Stanton Friedman, the question

896
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:08,240
 is not are UFOs per se machines of advanced technology from parts unknown.

897
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:13,320
 The question is has one ever been and for those of us that spend a good part of our

898
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,720
 lives looking into these questions, that answer is overwhelmingly yes.

899
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:27,640
 And we feel pretty certain that the UFOs and if they're manned or bodied, I don't know

900
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:32,920
 what's in them if there is such a thing, they are coming here with, they aren't coming

901
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:38,360
 to get our technology, they're coming with advanced technology, they're that far ahead

902
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,360
 of us.

903
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,720
 Well I don't think any of us assume these things run on coal, petroleum, or.

904
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,760
 Yeah right, okay.

905
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,960
 What it is is all theoretical.

906
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:53,740
 I have been involved in this field of study for over 35 years and I know that I have no

907
01:15:53,740 --> 01:16:00,560
 idea of where they come from, why they're coming, how they propel themselves.

908
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:07,720
 I can make better educated guesses than many people and I tend to shy away from colleagues

909
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,440
 who do tell me that they know the specific answers.

910
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:17,760
 For me that is somewhat problematical to say that you know the unknown definitively.

911
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,280
 There's only several ways you can.

912
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:24,200
 They told you, you read it in a book, you saw it in a movie, you dreamt it, it came

913
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:30,840
 to you in a vision, however my feeling is we are dealing with an area that is the epitome

914
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,840
 of the unknown.

915
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:37,360
 Okay I have one more question and I have to ask Linda because I only have a minute.

916
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:47,080
 Miss Moulton-Howe, explain a little bit further, I don't understand how these pieces and parts

917
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:55,960
 of the tissues are used, a genetic harvest, it's a genetic harvest.

918
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:56,960
 To be used how?

919
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,520
 I'm not there yet, I don't get it.

920
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,520
 What are they doing with it?

921
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,560
 They're going to take it back to outer space and do something, what are they doing with

922
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,720
 it?

923
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:15,240
 I think that the answer is very complicated.

924
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:23,120
 I think it involves on a more sophisticated level what we are beginning to do in our science

925
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:36,600
 with cloning and if you are advanced and you can take genetic material and you can clone,

926
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,860
 you can probably clone anything.

927
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:48,960
 So there is a chance, there is maybe the idea that we have parts of animals, parts of living

928
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:55,960
 animals that the aliens would like to clone because they are maybe stronger than what

929
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,880
 they have or why do they want ours?

930
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:08,700
 I don't have all the answers but genetic, a harvest of tissue, there might be a reason

931
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:16,920
 for why specific pieces and tissues are harvested, not because anything is being done with the

932
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:27,440
 bovine itself, it's the genetic DNA, it's the DNA that would be used.

933
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:34,920
 So it's not a religious sacrament or it's not symbolic?

934
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:40,040
 We're talking about medical cloning.

935
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,040
 Could I just come in there to back up Linda there?

936
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:47,320
 I think we have to put things in perspective and it goes back to addressing the question

937
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,960
 in your last question.

938
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:55,800
 Realistically, every UFO researcher in the world will say of 100% of cases, 95% of them

939
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:01,360
 turn out to have a mundane explanation, that's a generally accepted figure worldwide.

940
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:06,420
 Have a mundane, whether it be astronomical misinterpretation, that's a generally accepted

941
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:07,420
 figure.

942
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:11,960
 But really where we start to delve down is when we look at the 5%, well when you look

943
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:17,720
 at the 5% after investigation you end up with probably about 3% of hardcore cases.

944
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:24,520
 Now these are hardcore cases after investigation, well I am bothered about the 97% and your

945
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:29,760
 remit here is not really to speculate in my opinion as to where and what they're doing,

946
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,960
 it's really to establish the facts.

947
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:38,240
 And the facts are very, very apparent from very credible people that we are demonstrating

948
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:43,120
 that this is a subject that needs to be addressed on an evidential basis.

949
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,560
 And it's not for us to speculate really where they're coming from, what their agenda is,

950
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,820
 it's really to look at the evidence.

951
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:55,160
 This is a hearing to look at evidence and this is what we should be doing.

952
01:19:55,160 --> 01:20:04,960
 And the evidence in that 3% is what counts and the media really need to look at the 3%,

953
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:10,400
 the cases that defy all explanation after investigation, that's what evidence is.

954
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,240
 Is there evidence that would stand up in a court of law?

955
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,480
 Yes there is.

956
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:20,280
 If there was a plain crash scenario just outside this building and we all happened to be on

957
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,000
 a coffee break, we'd all be material witnesses to it.

958
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,000
 However, when we talk about UFOs, the media suddenly make us all crazy.

959
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,880
 And that is wrong and this needs to be addressed and the panel in front of me are the representatives

960
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,120
 that can help make that happen.

961
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:46,280
 We are relying on you to use your voice and experience to listen to the evidence.

962
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:53,520
 And all any UFO investigator wants, all we want is a level playing field, that is not

963
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,960
 a lot to ask in the world, we just want to present evidence.

964
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:01,040
 But sir, are you suggesting we listen and don't ask questions?

965
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:08,640
 No, of course not, but in the limited timeframe that we have, we have only so little time.

966
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:14,160
 If we don't ask the mundane, simple question that the public is asking, you aren't going

967
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,960
 to get anything out of this panel.

968
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,040
 No, I accept that, but we're here to look at evidence.

969
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:24,000
 But the evidence goes to implication and that's what you're asking about.

970
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
 And the implication of all of this is most of the world is probably at the stage of pretty

971
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,240
 lights in the sky that form patterns or can be stationary and put beams down.

972
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:46,240
 And what I just presented to you in a brief way was just a tiny, tiny scratch on the surface

973
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:55,360
 of 33 years of my trying to understand animal mutilations and why, which goes out to a thousand

974
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,680
 other branches.

975
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:07,600
 If the pretty lights in the sky and the beams for centuries have been involved with harvesting

976
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:17,480
 material from this earth, I don't know that there's any homo sapien who can answer why.

977
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:25,520
 But there is no question in my mind or anybody who has investigated that we're dealing with

978
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:34,160
 advanced intelligences, with advanced technology that can fold space time, sir, that's how

979
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:43,240
 it's faster than the speed of light and that in so doing that their focus is on what we

980
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:53,360
 as homo sapiens have only begun to investigate and that is the DNA, the genetic material

981
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:59,240
 and that we're now finally doing experiments in the subject of cloning.

982
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:04,560
 It's a bottom line that what is happening on this planet and it has for centuries is

983
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:13,040
 there is a harvest of genetic material, plants, animals and humans.

984
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:18,160
 Why and to what end is a very complicated story.

985
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:22,360
 And I think that what I had just realized and you're asking me the question which goes

986
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:32,160
 to implication is that the disconnect between the current world population of seven billion

987
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:37,480
 and what is actually happening on this planet in relationship to other intelligences, the

988
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:48,800
 gap is so great that to address the details that are known and what our government knows

989
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:56,720
 is so difficult that right now the inertia of silence on the part of government agencies

990
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:01,900
 who have a great deal of information, let me guarantee you, that they feel that this

991
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:05,240
 is a subject that cannot be presented.

992
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:12,020
 And I do know that there was a high ranking naval officer who told one of his lower ranking

993
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:20,720
 officers who had seen a craft who was exposed to the photographs from Roswell of the bodies.

994
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:27,800
 The high ranking authority when asked by the low ranking authority who had seen the craft

995
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:34,540
 and asked the higher ranking, when are you going to tell the people?

996
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:37,400
 And the answer was never.

997
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:44,080
 And the implication there politically is that we are now in the United States of America

998
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:51,760
 where there is an unstated policy of total complete silence for the foreseeable future

999
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:59,680
 because it is too difficult to change what has been known to something that might upend

1000
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,280
 a lot of subjects.

1001
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:15,760
 I would like to turn it now to Congressman Carolyn Kilpatrick, please.

1002
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,640
 That will be Congresswoman, sir.

1003
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,640
 Yes, thank you.

1004
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,640
 Thank you very much.

1005
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,640
 I am easily corrected.

1006
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,640
 Thank you.

1007
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,920
 Not to correct you, just woman here.

1008
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:31,160
 I certainly want to appreciate and thank you all for coming again.

1009
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,840
 Every day is a different day.

1010
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,360
 This is the first day of the rest of all of our lives.

1011
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:43,000
 How we use it, how we put it together, how we share and give back is what we are here

1012
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
 for.

1013
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,600
 So I commend you for your testimony.

1014
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,840
 A lot of notes, a lot of work and my mind is boggled.

1015
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:59,360
 I think I want to ask you first, Mr. Hazelton, Royal Air Force, security, police, hundreds

1016
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:08,640
 of incidents yet today, what is the position of the British government on UFOs?

1017
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:13,880
 And is it similar to US who are cousins or is it something different or do we do this

1018
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:14,880
 in British?

1019
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,920
 Do they speak?

1020
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,320
 Tell me what is the position there?

1021
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:24,280
 The bottom line is that there is the special relationship with America and America is quite

1022
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:29,400
 clearly the most secretive government in the world on UFOs and it leads, their fingers

1023
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,240
 are in every decent UFO report around the world.

1024
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,240
 I want to know about Britain.

1025
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:39,400
 Okay, well Britain follows generally America's lead on most things and Britain does the same.

1026
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:44,000
 They have been releasing over the last three and a half years several batches of files

1027
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:49,760
 which are in terms of papers, hundreds of thousands of single sheets of paper.

1028
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,760
 However, the majority of the paper that has been released is very low level, it's mostly

1029
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:59,760
 correspondence and amongst that there are some very good cases.

1030
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:06,160
 For example, a British case in 1957, Milton Torres, a pilot, US pilot flying over Ipswich

1031
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:12,160
 in Suffolk, England and he was stationed there flying a super saber.

1032
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:17,960
 He was vectored towards a radar target and he was ordered to fire his missile at the

1033
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:18,960
 target.

1034
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,560
 He actually got the launch codes when he went to launch, it jammed.

1035
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,560
 Okay, stop.

1036
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:24,560
 Okay, in Britain.

1037
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,560
 Stop, yeah.

1038
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,560
 You don't give me cases.

1039
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,560
 We got cases.

1040
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,560
 Okay.

1041
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,560
 I want to know what's happening in Britain.

1042
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,560
 I want to know what's happening in the military.

1043
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,560
 Britain is very lame.

1044
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,560
 I want to know what's happening on top of the government.

1045
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:38,720
 The media is very similar to the US in not reporting, it belittles the subject and it's

1046
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:45,800
 criminal and there is very little or no difference in the UK to the US.

1047
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,200
 This is a world phenomenon that we're discussing.

1048
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,200
 Absolutely.

1049
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,200
 You all know it way better than we do.

1050
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,200
 Absolutely.

1051
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:57,080
 We've heard testimony now three days and read a month leading up to this, videos and all.

1052
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,080
 Miss Howe.

1053
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,080
 Yes.

1054
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,080
 And it's really for all of you.

1055
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:04,920
 And I think you ended your presentation on something like this.

1056
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:10,320
 What and why is such a profound reality.

1057
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,280
 Yes.

1058
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:17,120
 Not being built upon, internalized.

1059
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:23,080
 If I have my military who comes to me and tells me they've got data, experiences and

1060
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:28,200
 other kinds of things that this is real, other countries I've been on elevator and in the

1061
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:34,200
 hotels with others from Chile and Peru and everywhere else in the world or many places

1062
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:40,440
 in the world, when we already acknowledge that whatever it is is more significant than

1063
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:45,600
 what we have here and obviously in Britain and some of the other countries, the why of

1064
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,520
 it, your scientific data is outstanding.

1065
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:56,240
 I think the answer is probably in a coalition of nations and not in our governments.

1066
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,080
 Obviously because the governments know something we don't know and they aren't sharing it

1067
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:03,840
 and it could be critical and catastrophic for the human being.

1068
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:12,600
 Well, let me add a post script to yesterday's presentation on vent waters.

1069
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:21,000
 It's a major case that involved dozens of military people on a very important base.

1070
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:30,600
 I for one at least have been exposed to information from two people that within 24 hours of the

1071
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:39,120
 Jim Peniston, John Burroughs and Ed Kvansack encounter with the black glassy craft with

1072
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:46,960
 the hieroglyphic symbols on it in the forest that within 24 hours in the UK, the National

1073
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:52,400
 Security Agency of the United States took over everything that was happening at Van

1074
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,400
 Water.

1075
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,240
 They testified to that.

1076
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:04,160
 This is important because it means that within 24 hours a decision had been made somewhere

1077
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:10,520
 at some level between the United States and the UK that the United States would take precedent

1078
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,760
 through the National Security Agency.

1079
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,080
 Okay, stop.

1080
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,080
 We heard that.

1081
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,080
 No, am I good?

1082
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,480
 I don't know the scientific part.

1083
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,200
 I'm just going to tell you the political and what we do and what things we know about

1084
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:25,680
 our country and the world and our relationships with very countries of the world.

1085
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,240
 You got to teach us something else.

1086
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,240
 Wait.

1087
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:31,800
 Let me just finish my point because don't give me that testimony we had yesterday.

1088
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,200
 We all heard it, we got notes and we got to read it and embellish it.

1089
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:38,560
 I want to move it to the action phase.

1090
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:43,320
 You came here to ask us to do something and we got to know how, what and why.

1091
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,320
 Haven't got there yet.

1092
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:47,000
 Maybe by Friday or next month or as we move this over the next couple of years we'll get

1093
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,440
 closer than you got in 30 years and you have to be commended.

1094
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:54,860
 What you have unveiled is something is there that we're not alone.

1095
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:55,860
 I'm still learning.

1096
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,160
 I want to learn more about that, in fact.

1097
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:03,840
 But as I learn it, the existence as we know it is being jeopardized and may not exist

1098
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,720
 next week, let alone 30 more years.

1099
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:12,400
 I was only going to your point about international versus the United States.

1100
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:18,960
 It's my impression that the United States for some reason politically is carrying the

1101
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,600
 weight of the disclosure.

1102
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:27,360
 I don't know why because other countries have bodies, have craft, have photographs, have

1103
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,360
 physical evidence.

1104
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:33,080
 But the United States going back to World War II and decisions that were made for some

1105
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:39,960
 reason it is this country that seems to have the pivotal weight in the disclosure.

1106
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:40,960
 What do you think that is?

1107
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,960
 What do you think that is?

1108
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:47,560
 U.S. is the, if it's not for real, it's perceived to be the power of the world.

1109
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,400
 And that's exactly the reason why it's not for real.

1110
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,400
 Right.

1111
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,400
 Right.

1112
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:56,760
 So we sit here in the power of the world, but the power not of this world or we don't

1113
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:57,760
 know how it fits.

1114
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,400
 Do you think America wants to lose that power?

1115
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,400
 Hold it, sir.

1116
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,400
 Hold it.

1117
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,400
 Hold it.

1118
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,400
 Hold it.

1119
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,400
 Hold it.

1120
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,400
 You can't interrupt a congressperson.

1121
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:06,400
 I will yield to you in a moment, though.

1122
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,960
 I will because I just want to, we just, we want to get to what we need to get to really

1123
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:15,240
 and how we get to make it something so that we can all live another hundred years or thereabouts.

1124
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:18,320
 So I'm going to yield to you, Mr. Hilton, in just a second.

1125
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:19,320
 And you too.

1126
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,240
 I don't want to, I'm just getting antsy up here.

1127
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:27,480
 Today you all took it to, every day it's another level, woo, woo, but I hate how we trivialize

1128
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,480
 this situation.

1129
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,480
 Exactly.

1130
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:33,000
 I hate the men with the horns and all that and what my colleague read yesterday.

1131
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,920
 And that's been since day one.

1132
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:41,120
 And I'm telling you, what we know, it's so profound and so big and so real when you don't

1133
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,640
 know how to deal with it, you trivialize it.

1134
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:46,720
 So when people think that we're coming, you all have been combining us, we've all taken

1135
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,040
 a lot of flak and we're proud of it.

1136
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,200
 We're servants of the people.

1137
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,720
 But to come here and then hear this other crap in my home paper as well, I don't even

1138
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:00,760
 talk to them because you can't say conspiracy if you're a congressman because they really

1139
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,600
 think you're wacko.

1140
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:08,760
 But there's something out here that's been coordinated from our leadership, not the president

1141
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:15,640
 person, but the office and our military and our press that's a national conglomeration

1142
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,640
 that continues.

1143
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:20,200
 And unless we can somehow step outside of that and build some kind of coalitions and

1144
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:25,760
 work and pray and build and speak and teach, we're going to lose.

1145
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:26,760
 And what will the world be?

1146
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,320
 It might be those things that have been drawn for all of my life.

1147
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:35,320
 I yield to Mr. Haysclan rest of my time.

1148
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,600
 May I make a suggestion?

1149
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:43,160
 You all as witnessed on Monday, the very what I thought it was an historic moment at the

1150
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:48,240
 end when you were concluded, summing up the first day where you all said no, we should

1151
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,800
 have congressional hearings.

1152
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,920
 Now for a ufologist, that's an amazing thing for you to say.

1153
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,680
 And I appreciate that tremendously.

1154
01:33:55,680 --> 01:34:02,060
 But I think what I need you to do realistically as people with over 80 years experience is

1155
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:04,920
 to say that to NBC, CNN.

1156
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:10,680
 So ring up your colleagues at 6 o'clock today and say I'm calling a press conference collectively

1157
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:13,440
 where all six of you say we believe in you.

1158
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:18,280
 Do you think that the press, listen, we talked to the press for 10 minutes, 30 minutes.

1159
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,860
 They take the 10 seconds that they want.

1160
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,320
 That's why it's got to be a people to people thing.

1161
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,520
 It's not going to be from the press.

1162
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,040
 I know that, but we battle the press and that is the principal reason why nobody knows this

1163
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,040
 subject.

1164
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,040
 We're in the press club.

1165
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,040
 Have you seen the article in any of these posts?

1166
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,040
 Precisely.

1167
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,040
 But why aren't they here?

1168
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,040
 They're here.

1169
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,040
 They are.

1170
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:40,000
 Can I just add momentarily on to my colleague's thoughts?

1171
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:47,520
 It's not so much that you're saying something on the record about your reevaluation of this

1172
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,980
 subject based on the knowledge that you're acquiring here and in your readings.

1173
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:58,280
 It's the cumulative effect of all of you and the people now serving in your positions that

1174
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:03,480
 will make the change, but it must begin somewhere with people taking a stand like your good

1175
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,480
 selves.

1176
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,480
 We believe it.

1177
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,480
 Thank you.

1178
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,480
 Thank you.

1179
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:19,080
 I'd like to call on Congresswoman Darlene Hooley, Congresswoman.

1180
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,080
 Thank you Mr. Chair.

1181
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,680
 Thank you all of you for your testimony.

1182
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,960
 It's been terrific.

1183
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:30,200
 When did we start sort of this whole ridicule piece?

1184
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,200
 Yes.

1185
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,200
 May I take that?

1186
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,200
 Yes, Peter.

1187
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:41,840
 It has become a research specialty of mine and it begins literally the summer of 1947.

1188
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:45,580
 For me, I began questioning this over 20 years ago.

1189
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:52,520
 How is it that my saying to you, Congresswoman, I saw something in the sky the other day or

1190
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:57,840
 the other night that I couldn't recognize or did something that I had never seen, case

1191
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:07,900
 closed, why is it that in terms of 66 years of Western journalism, popular culture, attitudes

1192
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:14,480
 and ideas about flying saucers and little green men that you hear me make a simple observation

1193
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:19,820
 and you're wired to think, gee, I didn't know Peter had mental problems or maybe he's kind

1194
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:25,780
 of gone mystical or he wants to feel special or he wants to perpetrate a hoax or he wants

1195
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:33,000
 to be on the Oprah show or in the words of the late Dr. Wilhelm Reich, evasion of the

1196
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,380
 obvious.

1197
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,380
 Why is it?

1198
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:36,380
 How did that happen?

1199
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:37,920
 It wasn't an accident.

1200
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,320
 I spent years studying that first wave of media.

1201
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:48,720
 I'm the only person you've ever met that has downloaded and read in order every single

1202
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:55,520
 article the New York Times has ever published on the subject of UFOs, extraterrestrials,

1203
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:01,640
 flying disks, et cetera, in order repeatedly looking for a pattern of reportage.

1204
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:05,440
 And it begins the week after the Roswell incident.

1205
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:11,680
 The Times didn't even deem it worthwhile to make that first report when it was reported

1206
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:17,420
 that a machine of undetermined origin had crashed outside of this town in New Mexico.

1207
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:21,640
 They waited until the cover story had gone into effect.

1208
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:28,820
 And I would say, as a non-statistician, 98% of the New York Times coverage, and I stress

1209
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:35,420
 here that in 1947, even more than now, the New York Times was the flagship of Western

1210
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:36,420
 journalism.

1211
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:38,360
 It still is in print terms.

1212
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:43,340
 The influence the Times exerted over the other news syndicates was marked.

1213
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:49,020
 The Copley Syndicate, Hearst Papers, all of the major American papers followed the Times

1214
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:55,100
 lead as a rule, and the Times hit the floor with all four wheels spinning.

1215
01:37:55,100 --> 01:38:00,060
 Every coverage, and I will be happy to send you an unpublished paper on this if you're

1216
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,060
 curious.

1217
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:10,160
 Anybody on the committee was sarcastic, condescending, ridiculing, explaining away like a parent

1218
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:12,520
 to a bad child.

1219
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:18,720
 Almost immediately they start to trot out authorities, often unnamed, often very contemptuous

1220
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:28,140
 of the subject because overwhelmingly they're astronomers and psychologists.

1221
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,980
 You would actually laugh if you read some of these articles.

1222
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:35,840
 They're breathtaking in their ignorance and pseudo-science.

1223
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:43,540
 Now what I did was I overlaid on that timeline of these articles several hundred authentic,

1224
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:48,020
 fully vetted, declassified documents from every agency you can imagine.

1225
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:54,420
 I would say it's about a 95% rate as you go through these where you see these silly headlines

1226
01:38:54,420 --> 01:39:05,060
 and phenomenally goofy excuses, and then you see Air Force, starting in September of '47,

1227
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:10,480
 Air Force intelligence, Army intelligence, CIA, et cetera.

1228
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,540
 We are concerned these are not Soviet.

1229
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:16,100
 They may be extraterrestrials.

1230
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:21,620
 By the way, two words at the time in 1947 and so on.

1231
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:30,420
 What happened was it was drummed into the minds of editors, reporters that this is the

1232
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,780
 way this thing is reported.

1233
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:33,900
 Now again I stress these are the nationals.

1234
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:39,560
 The locals, as Peter said, have almost always had an inquiring mind and acted independently

1235
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,780
 actually searching for information.

1236
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:48,380
 I cannot prove, I couldn't offer you a shred of real evidence of why I think this is and

1237
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:53,500
 how it happened, but deductive reasoning, a lot of study and common sense suggest to

1238
01:39:53,500 --> 01:40:01,860
 me that a number of key individuals in the Truman administration, either with the understanding

1239
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:11,020
 of the president or not to preserve plausible liability, either with the coordination of

1240
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:18,900
 the study group that had formed around the president in 1947 or not, went to New York,

1241
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:25,820
 to Boston, to Los Angeles to meet with people like David Sarnoff of NBC, the owners of The

1242
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:31,620
 Times, the Hearst people, and one of several things passed.

1243
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:36,260
 They basically said we're a little concerned based on that old bugaboo of Orson Welles

1244
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:41,540
 in 1938, mass panic, you know everybody's worried about the Russians right now.

1245
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:45,540
 The president would consider it a personal favor if you kind of toe the line on this

1246
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:51,420
 and just treat it not seriously or in some cases possibly saying, because these were

1247
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:56,540
 major players, these folks were power brokers and among the most influential people in the

1248
01:40:56,540 --> 01:41:03,100
 country at the time, that we need your assistance, it's your patriotic duty.

1249
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:09,420
 Now once that pattern was set into place, what reporter that picks up on the reality

1250
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:13,820
 of this and wants to do a serious piece of reportage is going to risk their career?

1251
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:15,740
 We all know it's a joke.

1252
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:20,020
 Now to a great degree, that pattern is still stuck in the major media.

1253
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:23,700
 It is changing, but that, I believe, is how it began.

1254
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:28,340
 And one of, thank you.

1255
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:33,340
 I think I have one minute left, anyone that would like to tackle this question.

1256
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:39,100
 We've got a problem time-wise, a serious problem time-wise.

1257
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:41,060
 I yield back my one minute.

1258
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:42,780
 Thank you very much.

1259
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,100
 And I would ask my colleague.

1260
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,260
 I hope you make that up somewhere.

1261
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:47,260
 Yes, oh yeah.

1262
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:49,060
 You know where we're going to make it up?

1263
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,980
 We're not going to eat today, if we keep it up.

1264
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:56,460
 We're going to have the food of knowledge, but not much more.

1265
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:02,980
 I'd like to ask my colleague if he could restrict his time.

1266
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:10,300
 I'm going to wipe my time out because we've been liberal in letting the witnesses express

1267
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:14,100
 themselves and that's of course why we're here, for you to express yourself.

1268
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:17,300
 But here too, since this doesn't work, maybe this works.

1269
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:20,940
 When you see me doing that, wind it down intelligently.

1270
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:21,940
 Thank you.

1271
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:29,060
 And just a brief close to what he was saying, and that is that one year after the July 47

1272
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:35,980
 crashes, there was another one in Aztec, New Mexico in March of 1948.

1273
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:43,340
 And the editor of the Farmington newspaper at the time did receive, from all that we

1274
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:52,720
 have been able to learn, did receive a request by somebody in the Pentagon to not report

1275
01:42:52,720 --> 01:43:00,180
 about what had happened, that there was distinct pressure put on to a local editor.

1276
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:08,860
 And I believe that that is the way that the Defense Department and local media, that was

1277
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:15,660
 shortly after World War II, and so the population was less and the local media were much, much

1278
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:19,680
 more inclined to take some requests by the Pentagon.

1279
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:20,680
 Thank you.

1280
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:28,420
 I now yield to Congressman Mike Cook, Mayor Cook, I'm sorry.

1281
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:30,420
 Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1282
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:40,460
 Mr. Davenport, you indicated you received about 86,000 incidents, I guess, over the

1283
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:43,100
 years, about 3,000 to 5,000 a year.

1284
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:50,740
 Your list here of 62, and I appreciate that you went back to 1936 on the first one, and

1285
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:59,460
 I noticed that probably 55 or more are more recent, probably in the last 15 or 16 years.

1286
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:05,260
 I take it this might be a top 62 hit list or something of incidents that you think.

1287
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:11,940
 So what I'm really asking is, what was the standard that you used for including these,

1288
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:16,880
 and they are certainly interesting, events and sightings.

1289
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,960
 Thank you for the question, Congressman Cook.

1290
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:25,420
 There were several criteria, the drama involved with the sighting, the degree of corroboration,

1291
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:32,300
 the degree of verification, but in essence, I drew up that list as a distillation from

1292
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:38,620
 the 86,000 cases for the committee's benefit to show you some of the more dramatic, well-founded

1293
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:41,380
 cases that we have in our database.

1294
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:45,660
 And you, like others that have studied this, would probably say that a high percentage

1295
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:50,860
 of the 86,000 that you've received are probably not credible.

1296
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:56,820
 I mean, it doesn't take a very high percentage to make a really important case here, so I'm

1297
01:44:56,820 --> 01:45:04,060
 trying to get a sense of what you think would be a credible percentage of all those numbers.

1298
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:07,240
 It's very difficult to quantify that.

1299
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:12,900
 I've attempted to do it, but the difficulty is, it is very difficult to know for sure

1300
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:17,940
 with 100 percent accuracy what is a genuine UFO sighting and what is not.

1301
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:24,940
 Well, I think you've put together some very good work on sightings of UFOs.

1302
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:31,740
 So I'm going to jump to the next thing, and until I saw the last statement, I was sort

1303
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:37,340
 of accepting this, but I have to say, and it's not too different than the concern that

1304
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:42,660
 I think Congressman Bartlett expressed earlier.

1305
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:50,780
 You said here at the back, without indicating ET aspects of these sightings -- now, maybe

1306
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:55,860
 there are some that you just didn't include in this list, but it's a fact that we have

1307
01:45:55,860 --> 01:46:04,540
 -- that this is ET, that ET is real, and I'm just asking you, how -- well, let me ask you

1308
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:05,540
 this.

1309
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:12,020
 Isn't it a leap to say, okay, UFOs exist as Dr. -- well, Dr. Bartlett has indicated, and

1310
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:13,020
 then saying it's ET.

1311
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:16,260
 I mean, aren't there other explanations for UFOs?

1312
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:18,540
 Are there no other explanations?

1313
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:19,540
 Is it the only explanation?

1314
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:20,540
 That's what I'm asking.

1315
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:21,540
 Yeah.

1316
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:24,220
 Probably not the only explanation.

1317
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:28,300
 I have to say that because we don't have a definitive answer yet to what we're dealing

1318
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:34,260
 with, but it is difficult for me to imagine that some of the craft and some of the circumstances

1319
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:40,260
 that are reported to our center are of terrestrial origin, just given the flight characteristics

1320
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,220
 of many of the craft reported to us.

1321
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:48,980
 In other words, probably in these 62 cases, you would say it's the best explanation.

1322
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:51,820
 Is that what you're saying?

1323
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:56,660
 And is that why they get included on the list, if you think it's the best explanation for

1324
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:58,140
 ET?

1325
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:00,780
 Or you're just saying, hey, there was credibility.

1326
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:04,220
 We don't know what it was yet, but clearly they saw something.

1327
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:05,220
 It's very strange.

1328
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:09,380
 I mean, you have some ET index that you're applying to this list.

1329
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:10,380
 I take it?

1330
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:11,940
 Or you wouldn't said that at the end?

1331
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:12,940
 Yeah.

1332
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:17,060
 I would not have included those cases in that list had they not been of extreme interest

1333
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:18,500
 to me.

1334
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:24,140
 I am a scientist trained in that capacity, and I would not have included those cases

1335
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:29,900
 in that list had they not had associated with them good, solid, hard objective evidence.

1336
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:36,220
 As part of your scientific training, you are saying here that it's still a leap between

1337
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:43,420
 a belief in a UFO and knowing without a doubt that it's ET.

1338
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:44,420
 I would say more--

1339
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:45,420
 You said yes?

1340
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:46,420
 I would say more--

1341
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:48,700
 Well, you said, yeah, but I want to make sure I hear this correct.

1342
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:53,820
 And really, I want you to say what you truthfully believe and think based on your experience.

1343
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:58,620
 Clearly you've had a lot of time to think about this a lot, and you are obviously an

1344
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:02,260
 impressively trained scientist.

1345
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:09,140
 I would characterize it not so much as a leap as a step in that direction, and if these

1346
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:14,460
 craft are not of extraterrestrial origin, I have no explanation for them.

1347
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:20,920
 Craft that can hover motionless for five minutes above Phoenix, craft that can accelerate

1348
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:26,820
 at a rate so fast that it's reported from multiple witnesses their eyes could not follow

1349
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:28,300
 the craft as it departed.

1350
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:34,260
 I understand the maneuvering that you're saying, and it's certainly the best maybe, in your

1351
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:35,860
 mind, the best explanation.

1352
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:42,740
 I'd like to go to Gary Heseltine, I have to say that I'm particularly impressed with your

1353
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:50,900
 list of sightings, and the reason I'm impressed is because they're from policemen, every one

1354
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:51,900
 of these.

1355
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:57,260
 This is a pretty thick list, a lot of them, so I imagine the credibility on your list

1356
01:48:57,260 --> 01:49:04,200
 you would rank as certainly higher than what many people that collect data would indicate.

1357
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,340
 I don't want to put any words in your mouth.

1358
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:10,460
 No, you've actually highlighted something that I hope to be able to answer, and I think

1359
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:15,700
 the real answer is that when I said to you before that the accepted figure is three percent

1360
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:20,340
 after investigation, well that's not really the end of it because I would argue that in

1361
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:26,900
 the high caliber witness categories, high caliber I would mean astronauts, cosmonauts, pilots,

1362
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:34,220
 military and commercial, radar operators, sonar operators, in these very high caliber

1363
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:40,800
 witness categories, the percentage after investigation would be much, much higher than that three

1364
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,800
 percent.

1365
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:46,260
 I would hazard a guess that if you looked at military pilots with millions of dollars

1366
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:52,740
 spent on their training, the percentage of error would be much reduced, and I would hazard

1367
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:56,180
 a guess that it would be something in the region of 80 percent plus were accurate.

1368
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:59,780
 Okay, then I'm going to quickly ask you, well I'm not going to ask you because I only have

1369
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:03,700
 a minute left, but I'm going to say certainly credibility of people like Captain Solace

1370
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:08,540
 who's sitting here in the front row, that probably caused the United States Air Force

1371
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:16,780
 to come up with filters over their ICBM silos is certainly going to be a credible experience

1372
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:17,780
 in the UFO.

1373
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:20,620
 Well, I think that's where we need to look at when we look at collective evidence.

1374
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:29,100
 I'm sorry to catch you, but I know that we're trying, I'm going to ask Ms. Howe, very interesting

1375
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:40,980
 slides, very interesting, Nevada Proving Ground, Dagway, Utah, I'm from Utah, talk about secrets,

1376
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:46,100
 let's talk about nuclear testing secrets, could nuclear testing have a lot to do with

1377
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:50,900
 these animal carcasses and the bloodless?

1378
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:51,900
 Isn't that a...

1379
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:59,100
 Our first test was in July of 1945, there are mutilation records going back, as I said,

1380
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:00,100
 to 1911.

1381
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:01,100
 Okay, good answer.

1382
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:11,220
 Let me ask you this though, the one thing that maybe I scratched my head on a little

1383
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:19,820
 bit for a statement, well, I scratch my head on a lot, I'll have to say that, that it absolutely

1384
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:23,660
 is evidence of genetic harvesting.

1385
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:27,260
 I mean, that may be your belief, that may be something that you...

1386
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:28,260
 You say there's...

1387
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:29,260
 No, it's not a belief.

1388
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:32,220
 Are you saying there's no possibility it could be anything but genetic harvesting, what these

1389
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:33,840
 slides are showing?

1390
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:36,780
 We're not in the context of belief here at all.

1391
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:40,700
 We're in the context of hard physical evidence, medical evidence.

1392
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:46,460
 The purpose of how that was, how that carcass ended up the way it was, is what I'm asking.

1393
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:47,460
 That has to be...

1394
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:54,060
 You're saying that's proof, absolute 100% proof, to the extent that the law of gravity

1395
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:57,060
 is pretty much proven.

1396
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:04,800
 The next round of the hearing is documents, and there have been leaked documents from

1397
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:10,900
 inside our own government, in which the phrase extraterrestrial biological entities, with

1398
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:18,300
 the acronym, all caps, E-B-E-S, has been included since at least a printing of what I think

1399
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:25,340
 is a document that none of us have found any dispute over, the SOM 101 document with a

1400
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:28,860
 1954 war office stamp on it.

1401
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:35,860
 If our government, going back to FDR, which there were also leaked documents about the

1402
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:48,500
 discussion between FDR and the Secretary of War, Marshall, after February 1942, made the

1403
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:55,460
 front page of the Los Angeles Times, the photograph of our artillery and beams going up to a diamond

1404
01:52:55,460 --> 01:53:07,060
 shaped object, distributing some 1,417 bullets, and then having that discussed in documents

1405
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:14,500
 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt with the Secretary of War, and that in those documents that had

1406
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:22,200
 been leaked, it uses the terms, these were interplanetary, celestial, and that we were

1407
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:27,380
 retrieving these craft because we wanted to examine them.

1408
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:33,980
 That puts a context here, again, that would be before the war.

1409
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:38,320
 Well, I appreciate you're telling me that that's interesting to me, but you don't allow

1410
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:44,620
 any of the wiggle room that, for example, Mr. Davenport seems to allow in terms of final

1411
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:49,700
 conclusions, and that's certainly your right, because you've looked at these things a lot

1412
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:50,700
 more than I have.

1413
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:55,740
 I want to get the best information I can, as credibly put together as I can, to help,

1414
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:59,740
 as I said, break down the truth embargo.

1415
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:02,460
 That's what we need to do first, and maybe we have to do it a brick at a time.

1416
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:30,700
