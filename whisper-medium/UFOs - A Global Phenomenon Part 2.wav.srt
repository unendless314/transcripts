1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,680
 We are going to get started.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,160
 The meeting will come to order.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,280
 I want to thank the panel for being back again.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,920
 This is terrific having the kind of international panel we have had today, this morning, this

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,680
 afternoon.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,160
 The fact is sometimes we only think about ourselves as opposed to what's happening in the world.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,800
 So I appreciate you being here.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,240
 We all appreciate you being here and thank you for your time and your patience.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,040
 And with that, we will start with this panel.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,680
 This is a chance for you to ask questions in depth.

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,440
 And if we are good about it, we can go two rounds.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,560
 You'll each have 12 minutes.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,800
 So if you take all 12 at once, that's okay.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,280
 If you want to take six and then six later, you can do that.

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,480
 So I'll try to keep track of that or you can help me keep track of that.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,120
 And do I have anyone that would like to start?

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,160
 I'll start.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,280
 All right, Ms. Woolsey, Representative Woolsey.

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:27,800
 So my question is to each of you, if the United States becomes more transparent, releases

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:38,040
 files, and is more open about this situation, the United States government, would that be

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:47,680
 a help or a hindrance to your country and our relationships with you and why and how?

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
 Start down there.

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
 Okay.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,240
 Well, first of all, I'd like to clarify for the record, because a lot of people have a

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,340
 misconception that all these other countries have been wonderful and released all these

26
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,640
 files and the U.S. has released nothing, which is totally not true.

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,080
 I mean, you yourselves have been dealing with American governments like the documents like

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,320
 the one about Peru and things like that.

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,800
 So the U.S. was actually the first country to release UFO files, just for the record,

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
 I want to make that.

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,840
 It doesn't mean that they've released, you know, hardware or final conclusions.

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,080
 I mean, I'm not saying they've released everything they have.

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,880
 But it was the law.

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,400
 You know, the Freedom of Information Act, as you know, had been amended as a result

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,840
 of the Watergate scandal where you could sue the government, and then it occurred to some

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,800
 people that because there had been these rumors that the CIA and other agencies had been involved

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
 in ufology.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,360
 For years, the U.S. had said that only Blue Book, that's the only thing they had ever

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,420
 done about UFOs.

40
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:54,120
 So there was a famous lawsuit around 1977 against the CIA for their files on UFOs because

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,160
 there was many indications that they had done this thing called the Robertson Panel in 1953,

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,600
 a scientific conference on UFOs.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,000
 And there was a group forum called Citizens Against UFO Secrecy back in those days.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,360
 I know this story very well because that's when I was getting started as a journalist

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:17,080
 in the subject, and they sued the CIA, you know, because the law had been amended and

46
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,120
 now you could -- in the old days, you were at the mercy of the government, like the British

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,000
 used to be, too, until they passed the similar law where basically the government would release

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,720
 what they pleased and you had no recourse.

49
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,320
 But after Watergate, they amended that law.

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,760
 And so this group sued the CIA, and the CIA knew that they were going to lose the case

51
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,560
 because there was enough evidence about at least the Robertson Panel.

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,400
 So rather than go to court and be humiliated by a judge, they decided to, you know, cut

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,840
 their losses and they released 1,000 pages of documents.

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,000
 And that made huge front-page stories.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,480
 I mean, it was on the New York Times, on the Washington Post.

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,080
 It was a big story at the time.

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,160
 But now there's kind of an amnesia, you know, within -- and this -- partly the UFO community

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,660
 themselves are guilty for this because it's kind of politically correct to always criticize

59
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,280
 the U.S. government and say that the foreign governments are great.

60
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,520
 Well, it's the same thing.

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,160
 I mean, the Russians, sure, have released some things.

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,400
 Have they released everything?

63
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
 No.

64
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,120
 And the same, you know, maybe some of the smaller countries might have released everything

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,280
 because they have less, you know, less complex programs.

66
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,640
 So I wanted to get that on the record on this hearing.

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,240
 And then that was followed by the FBI that released their files with -- they're currently

68
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,600
 in a thing called the Vault, and they're online.

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,400
 And then the Defense Intelligence Agency and everything.

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,440
 And so the U.S. government has released stuff, but there's still a lot of gaps.

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,000
 I think we definitely would be helpful for everybody that everybody releases just about

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,040
 everything, unless it was something of truly national security that would affect that country.

73
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,440
 But otherwise, too much secrecy doesn't help anybody.

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
 Good.

75
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,600
 Thank you very much, Mr. -- we -- I figure we've got two, four, six, eight minutes left.

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,120
 If you can kind of think in two-minute segments, I'd appreciate it.

77
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,280
 Ma'am, as my colleague has indicated, my understanding certainly is that the U.S. government's public

78
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,080
 position is that it has already disclosed its files.

79
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,400
 I'm not aware, given that the U.K. government is nearly complete with its process of releasing

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,920
 this material, that any further releases from America would either harm or help our U.K.

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
 process.

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
 Thank you.

83
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
 Will.

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,680
 I would agree, especially with Antonio, that I believe the Americans have sort of got bad

85
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,200
 rap in this deal, that basically everybody in the world is just releasing siting files.

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,080
 Everybody's releasing file files, the real files, the ones we want to see.

87
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,200
 So the Americans have done that.

88
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,760
 In fact, I believe, maybe one of the few researchers who have written on this, that the American

89
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,160
 government is actually leaking parts of the story, using disinformation to cover it.

90
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,320
 But I don't think it's really going to affect the rest of the world.

91
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,440
 I think everybody is waiting for the Americans.

92
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,520
 The Americans are running the show, and everybody's waiting for the Americans to make the first

93
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
 move.

94
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:29,040
 I think that if we can make everything public, and such a high tech is going to be shared

95
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,720
 by all humankind in the world, this is a very good thing.

96
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:45,560
 However, generally speaking, that through our work, and if we disclose all those UFO

97
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,000
 information or ET information, it's going to benefit the whole humankind.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:03,640
 However, every government considers UFOs as top secrets of defense secrets, defense classification,

99
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,280
 and all the national security.

100
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,240
 If they treat the issues as UFO issues, purely UFO issues, that would be much easier.

101
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,720
 Otherwise, it's going to be very difficult.

102
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:24,800
 Since Europe, Russia, Latin America, the Vatican, even China, which has an open attitude, after

103
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:32,760
 all have some kind of disclosure attitude, why should the United States of America be

104
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,960
 different?

105
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,640
 There is a definite reason from an historical point of view.

106
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:49,000
 Surely as the most important world power, the United States feel a particular responsibility,

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:00,280
 and they surely fear that the UFO problem may cause a sort of uncontrollable reaction

108
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,120
 in the general public.

109
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,000
 So this is a possible explanation for the cover-up, for this conspiracy of silence,

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,160
 if you like.

111
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:22,440
 But I'm sure that since there is no longer the possibility to uncover all these subjects,

112
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,500
 the United States will be obliged in the next future to do something.

113
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:34,920
 Those consider that the world power, who will have the courage to say things as they were,

114
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,560
 will be considered much more than all the others.

115
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,280
 And probably this is not yet understood.

116
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:48,800
 And when this may happen, probably the United States may have something positive for themselves.

117
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
 Thank you very much.

118
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,720
 And with that, Madam Chair, I will reserve the balance of my time.

119
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,480
 Dr. Bartlett.

120
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 Thank you.

121
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,040
 Mr. Cameron, you mentioned mental phenomenon.

122
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,280
 Is that related to an interest in consciousness?

123
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
 Could you explain a bit?

124
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
 Okay.

125
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
 Let me give you the examples.

126
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
 I only figured this out a year ago.

127
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,380
 I've known about the top-secret memo and the reference to mental phenomena.

128
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,400
 Later when it occurred to me what had happened, as I mentioned in my testimony, we ran across

129
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,560
 Dr. Eric Walker, who was the former president of Penn State University.

130
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,480
 And during the conversations interviewers were having with him, they were pressing him

131
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,520
 on MJ-12, who runs the cover-up, is it all Americans, is it more than 12 people?

132
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,600
 And Walker cut him off.

133
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,400
 This is 1991, 41 years later.

134
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,880
 Walker cuts him off and says, "Let me ask you a question.

135
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,640
 What do you know about ESP?"

136
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
 The interviewer from Britain had no idea what to say.

137
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
 Walker answered his own question.

138
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,840
 He said, "Look, unless you understand about ESP and how it works, you will not be taken

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
 in."

140
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,040
 He's referring to the control group.

141
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,960
 Very few people understand it.

142
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,480
 Then two years later, Ben Rich, who ran Lockheed Skunk Works, and I can remind the Congress

143
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,880
 that you guys funded all these operations, the U-2, the SR-71, the stealth fighter, the

144
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,560
 stealth bomber, the drones.

145
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,000
 This guy ran Lockheed Skunk Works in 1993.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,360
 He's giving a lecture to the UCLA engineering alumni.

147
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,200
 And he stands up, and the last slide that he shows is a flying saucer.

148
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,200
 And he says, "We now have the technology to take ET home.

149
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,520
 We've discovered the mistake in the equation, and it's going to take an act of God to get

150
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,840
 this thing out of Congress because it's so deep black."

151
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,960
 Two of the people in the room were UFO researchers.

152
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,400
 They chased them out of the room, realizing this was a significant point in history.

153
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,440
 And they said to him, "Mr. Rich, you said you've discovered the mistake in the equation.

154
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
 What are you talking about?

155
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
 We're interested in UFO propulsion.

156
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,800
 How does it work?"

157
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,580
 And just like the Canadians in 1950, just like 1991, Eric Walker, Rich turns around

158
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,240
 and says to him, "Let me ask you a question.

159
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,480
 What do you know about ESP?"

160
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,180
 One guy says, "That just means everything in time and space is connected."

161
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,140
 He said, "That's how it works."

162
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,140
 Thank you.

163
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,240
 Mr. Pope, you mentioned air safety issues.

164
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,880
 With the maneuverability of these craft, do you mean that we're concerned that they would

165
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,080
 be hostile or they'd accidentally run into us or vice versa?

166
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:38,180
 Well, sir, it's the possibility of a collision between a commercial or military aircraft

167
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,720
 and whatever these UFOs might turn out to be.

168
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,680
 That was the concern.

169
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,600
 And I mentioned that there are on case file a number of near misses.

170
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:56,920
 Indeed, I believe a new case was publicized in mainstream media just two days ago.

171
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,840
 But there had never been a collision?

172
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,640
 Not in the UK, sir, no.

173
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,900
 And I mean, a couple of near misses that were close enough that the pilot flinched and called

174
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,280
 on one occasion, "Look out, look out," but no collision.

175
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,520
 Thank goodness, yeah.

176
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,920
 You mentioned electromagnetic propulsion.

177
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,240
 Does that include antigravity?

178
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,240
 I don't know, sir.

179
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
 That was it.

180
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
 You mentioned that in his report.

181
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,580
 You mentioned electromagnetic propulsion.

182
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,560
 That was in the French report about the Trans Improvance case, yes, and I think they had

183
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,840
 found it if they can show the slide of the Rockefeller from the briefing document.

184
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,880
 That was in their conclusions.

185
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
 That's the one.

186
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,920
 Conclusion, I probably cannot read it too well from here, but yeah, there you go.

187
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,600
 So this is the landing case in the farmers' field in Trans Improvance in 1981.

188
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,480
 Conclusion, physical phenomenon unexplained nature, high probability of electromagnetic

189
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,240
 mode of propulsion.

190
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,160
 And this is an official chart from the French Space Agency.

191
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,240
 So that's their conclusion.

192
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,160
 Also, since you had asked about the near collision, I might as well add that that's, as I explained

193
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,360
 in this morning's testimony, that again was one of the main reasons of the Chilean committee,

194
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,680
 the CEFA, to ensure air safety operations.

195
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,200
 That's part of their mission.

196
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,720
 And in their files that they have released in the radio pilot communications, they have

197
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,880
 also a couple of cases of near collision, which you can actually hear because they posted

198
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,880
 the audio tapes on their website.

199
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,920
 There was a case in Puerto Montt in the south of Chile in 1988 where you can literally hear

200
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,720
 – it's in Spanish, of course, because it's in Chile – you can literally hear the pilot

201
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,720
 freaking out because this object unexplained, he's called it control tower saying, "What

202
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
 is that object?

203
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
 Do you have traffic?"

204
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,680
 The control tower gets back to him, "No, we have no scheduled traffic."

205
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,340
 He said, "Well, this thing is almost about to crash with me."

206
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,960
 And then the people at the control tower, this object hovers near the airport, and so

207
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,840
 it was seen from the ground, not just by the pilots.

208
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,080
 Then the personnel at the airport was able to see this object hovering over the airport.

209
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,800
 And of course, there was not a near collision, but there was a famous similar case at the

210
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:39,320
 O'Hara airport in Chicago in 2006, I believe it was, which was quite significant, seen

211
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,120
 near the American Airlines terminal.

212
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,320
 And it only leaked out because I think it was the Chicago Tribune got wind of it.

213
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,620
 But the FAA never made any kind of official investigation or comment.

214
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,880
 So that is a problem that, regardless of what UFOs are, regardless of their origin, yes,

215
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,360
 it can pose a threat.

216
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,960
 And then General Bermudez, the head of the committee in Chile, also made another point.

217
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,280
 He says, "Even if it's not an immediate near collision, the pilot might get distracted

218
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,240
 because he's seeing something that is not supposed to be there.

219
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,280
 So it's maybe that he's not going to crash with the airplane, but instead of concentrating

220
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,000
 on flying his airplane, he's being distracted by an unknown object that is somehow getting

221
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 near him."

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,240
 So these are among the reasons that this subject should be investigated by the civil aviation

223
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,960
 agencies, which of course Chile is doing, but it should be done in other countries as

224
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
 well.

225
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:43,800
 The story this morning of the pilot chasing this UFO, I think I heard that in spite of

226
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,260
 how big it was and how obvious it was, there was no radar track?

227
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,260
 I don't...

228
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,720
 I think that's what I remember here.

229
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,360
 Yeah, I'm not sure of that.

230
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,920
 But I might as well add, there are another very significant case which happened in Iran

231
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,040
 in 1976, which again was revealed by American Defense Attaché documents.

232
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,920
 That's how the case became public, very famous case.

233
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,920
 The pilot at the time was a captain, eventually became a major general in the Iranian Air

234
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
 Force.

235
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,000
 In fact, he came and testified at a previous symposium here at the National Press Club.

236
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 He was the pilot that...same thing, this huge UFO object was flying over Tehran.

237
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,800
 This was in the days of the Shah.

238
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,440
 So the US had very good relations, as you know, with Iran, and that's how they got all

239
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,060
 the reports.

240
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,440
 But the difference there is that as he was instructed, again, to fire at this object

241
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,920
 because the object was not responding, was not identifying itself, suddenly all his weapons

242
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,640
 control panel was jammed and he could not fire.

243
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,000
 The thing wasn't working.

244
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,400
 The electromagnetic communication, the radio, everything was malfunction.

245
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,440
 This was an F-4 Phantom jet.

246
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,640
 And then, according to this pilot, who later became a general, he said that from the UFO,

247
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,640
 like a little object came, like the UFO was responding, that's as close as an actual combat

248
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,680
 between a UFO and it's all documented by the US government.

249
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,220
 There was even an evaluation by the Defense Intelligence Agency, which was later declassified,

250
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,700
 that call it an outstanding UFO report because it validated the existence of UFOs.

251
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,480
 This in the words of our own government.

252
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,400
 And they list all the reasons why, because it was multiple witnesses.

253
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,080
 Some of the witnesses were very high ranking generals.

254
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,000
 Two airplanes had been scrambled.

255
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,080
 One of them had the malfunctions.

256
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,560
 So this is real.

257
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,160
 Now, where did that UFO came from and what was its purpose?

258
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
 We don't know that.

259
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,540
 But that the object was real, there's no question about it.

260
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:54,880
 If it's true that these things can absorb bullets and not be affected, then somehow

261
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,680
 they might be able to absorb radar and have no reflection?

262
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
 Yes.

263
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,800
 Well, for many years, researchers in ufology have known this and it's referred as the electromagnetic

264
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 effect.

265
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,160
 There are many cases involving cars.

266
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,320
 With airplanes, it's more worrisome because a car can stop in the middle of a close encounter

267
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,880
 and nothing will happen except inconvenience.

268
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,120
 But if you're flying an airplane and your electrical system, you know, your engine stalls,

269
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,700
 you're in trouble.

270
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,520
 But with airplanes, it's not as common, but there have been cases, although not crashes

271
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,800
 or perhaps.

272
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,200
 But I mean, I'm not right now aware of crashes.

273
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,400
 But with cars, it's fairly common.

274
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,240
 And this was referred, even in the '50s, as the electromagnetic effect.

275
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,080
 It is assumed that the UFO is emitting a field of energy.

276
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,120
 And this field of energy then will interfere with electrical systems.

277
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,800
 And even blackouts have been, in many cases, of power blackouts.

278
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,920
 Even the major blackouts, even in the United States, there were reports of UFO sightings

279
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,160
 near the power station where the blackout was triggered.

280
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,080
 There was, as a matter of fact, in Argentina, a case in 2009, which made some headlines,

281
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,240
 where there was a blackout in a town called Joaquin Gonzales in some province in Argentina

282
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
 right now.

283
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
 I forgot which one.

284
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:24,080
 And well, most people just, you know, had a power blackout, and then they saw this cigar-shaped

285
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,300
 object hovering over the city.

286
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,000
 But there was a reservoir with a power dam nearby.

287
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,880
 And one of the witnesses was fishing, because people go there for recreational fishing.

288
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,680
 And one of the witnesses said that he saw this disk hovering over one of the transformers,

289
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,760
 and there was, like, an exchange of energy between the UFO and the transformer.

290
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,200
 And as this energy exchange was happening, boom, there was kind of like a flash, and

291
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,640
 then the whole area went dark.

292
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,760
 So there is definitely an electromagnetic effect, but it needs to be studied more at

293
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,240
 depth for which we need resources to do so.

294
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,320
 Is there any—what are the suggestions as to what the energy source is that these craft

295
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
 use?

296
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,000
 Well, I'm not really an engineer, you know.

297
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,480
 I mean, I'm a science reporter, so I can give you a general idea.

298
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,800
 But they will have—I think tomorrow there was a session about technology.

299
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
 Did it happen already?

300
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
 I forgot.

301
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
 Tomorrow?

302
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 Yeah, tomorrow.

303
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,120
 Tomorrow there is a session of technology, where you will have people that would be more

304
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,720
 qualified than me.

305
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,040
 There's been—I mean, all these terms, anti-gravity and things like that have been used, you know,

306
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,760
 but you better get a response from someone more qualified than me for the technical—for

307
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,840
 the real technical details.

308
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,640
 But I can give you just a general idea.

309
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 Thank you very much.

310
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 My time is up.

311
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
 Thank you.

312
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
 Thank you.

313
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 Congressman Cook?

314
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
 Thank you.

315
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:03,800
 I'd like to resume with Grant Cameron and talk about the Wilbert Smith files.

316
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,600
 Wilbert Smith was the minister of—or one of the—worked for the Ministry of Transport.

317
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,860
 He was a senior radio engineer, and he later became superintendent of radio regulations

318
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,120
 for the Department of Transport.

319
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
 Okay.

320
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
 In Canada, of course.

321
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
 Yes.

322
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
 Thank you.

323
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,720
 And this file on UFOs was begun about 1950, am I right?

324
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,640
 The official government file goes from 1950 to 1954.

325
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,600
 His personal files—he died in 1962—became public in about 1982.

326
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,040
 His son released them to the University of Ottawa.

327
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
 Okay.

328
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,640
 Thank you for that, because I wanted to check for sure on when he died.

329
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,720
 That was about 20 years before those files were released?

330
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
 Correct.

331
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,680
 Okay.

332
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,000
 You've obviously looked at what's in those released files.

333
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,560
 Yes.

334
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,760
 What is the very best evidence in those Wilbert Smith files that we've just been talking

335
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
 about?

336
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
 The very best.

337
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:07,320
 If you had to take one specific incident or example, the very best you can think of, of

338
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:14,320
 an ET association with an unidentified flying object.

339
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:22,480
 And then I'm going to ask, in fact—or let me put any kind of ET association or body-found

340
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
 association.

341
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
 Okay.

342
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,800
 That's the testimony I presented today.

343
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,520
 The best we would have is the question that Wilbur, in his files, asked to Dr. Robert

344
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,840
 Saubacher in Washington in 1950 about the validity of the Crash Saucer book released

345
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,620
 in 1950, and he gets the response.

346
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,200
 The facts in the book are substantially correct.

347
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,960
 Now, Wilbur had a lot of interaction.

348
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
 There was contacts.

349
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,320
 They were in contact with an alien, the same one that the CIA was in contact with.

350
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
 There's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes.

351
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,600
 But in terms of an actual document, in terms of the actual material that's the hardest

352
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,980
 evidence is the material that he got from the Americans in 1950, which he used to write

353
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,720
 the top-secret memo, which he sent to the Deputy Minister of the Department of Transport

354
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,920
 asking for funds to research propulsion, of UFO propulsion.

355
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,480
 And he was given authorization, and that project ran until 1954 when this overflight of the

356
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,000
 Flying Saucer Station took place, and they shut the program down and made the statement.

357
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 There's nothing to it.

358
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 No equity.

359
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:38,700
 But the document—in other words, the best evidence of a body found is what was spoken

360
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,440
 between Dr. Saubacher and Wilbert Smith.

361
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
 Is that what I'm understanding?

362
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,880
 And is that in one of those documents that was released?

363
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:52,800
 Well, it's in the—I released to you today Smith's handwritten interview of the interview

364
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,200
 that he did in 1950, and it's later substantiated by Robert Saubacher, who says there were reports

365
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,360
 of instruments or people operating these machines, because he was questioned after Wilbur Smith

366
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
 died.

367
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,440
 People like Stanton Friedman started looking for him, and he says, "I remember in talking

368
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,360
 with some of the people in the office that they got the impression that these aliens

369
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
 were constructed."

370
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,200
 And he talks about what the aliens looked like.

371
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,000
 And he mentions in the room where von Braun, Oppenheimer, a number of the top scientists

372
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,920
 in the United States in 1950 were telling these stories.

373
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,320
 So Saubacher confirms the fact that he talked to Smith in 1950, and that he confirms in

374
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,040
 the letter that there were alien bodies involved.

375
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,680
 I appreciate your answer, and that's—what you've just described is what you feel is

376
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,180
 the best evidence of the question I asked.

377
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
 Yes.

378
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
 Okay.

379
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
 Fine.

380
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,180
 Okay.

381
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:52,720
 To Nick Pope, I'd like to ask you, while you were working in the Ministry of Defense

382
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:02,080
 in the UK, did any of your superiors tell you that part of your job is to ridicule English

383
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:12,880
 citizens or any UK citizen who had maybe filed a report or a siding that was legitimate?

384
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,240
 Nobody told me to do that directly, sir, but there was certainly a sort of unofficial policy

385
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,840
 that in responding to media inquiries, the press office would deliberately slip in terms

386
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:32,040
 such as little green men and flying saucers to disparage and downplay the subject.

387
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,680
 And they haven't told you what to say as a private citizen, have they?

388
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:42,480
 No, sir, but when I've written books, which I have in the past, I've had to submit those

389
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,800
 for official security clearance.

390
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
 Okay.

391
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,880
 Now I'd like to turn to our witness from the People's Republic of China.

392
00:25:50,880 --> 00:26:01,840
 Dr. Sheila, you've said what I think are truly interesting things when you say that the majority

393
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:09,320
 of the people of China absolutely believe not just in UFOs, but in an extraterrestrial

394
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,000
 source of the UFOs, and they believe in aliens.

395
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,240
 In fact, you made a statement earlier in your testimony that you put the existence of aliens

396
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,960
 right in with UFOs as something that's clearly – well, certainly you believe it.

397
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,760
 I understand that.

398
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:37,280
 And you talked about five events of what you call third kind cases, and I'll repeat those

399
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,720
 from your testimony a few hours ago.

400
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,680
 The Phoenix Mountain event – I want you to listen to these events carefully.

401
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,820
 You know them well, I'm sure.

402
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:54,880
 The Phoenix Mountain event, the Faxiang trapeze event, the Beijing Sokong event, the River

403
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,480
 Forest event, the Mayang alien research station event.

404
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:10,640
 Of those, I take it those are maybe some of the top five of all that China has gathered,

405
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,000
 which has been amazingly voluminous.

406
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,520
 Give us an example from one or two, if you'd like, and I want to know the best thing you

407
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,960
 can tell us from any of those events you've already mentioned that would give us some

408
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,240
 sense that there's an extraterrestrial origin to these sightings and to these UFOs, or that

409
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,200
 there are bodies, or aliens, alive or dead from these.

410
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
 Okay?

411
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
 Yes.

412
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,320
 I would like to talk about two, the first one and the last one.

413
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,360
 The first one is the Phoenix Mountain event.

414
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:09,880
 This is in the northeastern China, there is a farm there, and a ranger saw a flying disk

415
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,760
 within 100 meters, and he felt really uncomfortable, so he tried to stay away from that flying

416
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,480
 disk, and he and his cousin felt that.

417
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,240
 I hate to interrupt, but could you give us the year of this, or the time, the essential

418
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
 time?

419
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
 Approximately.

420
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
 1994.

421
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
 In June 1994.

422
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
 Go ahead.

423
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
 Continue, please.

424
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:45,160
 So, on the second day, this ranger led a dozen of people from the same farm trying to find

425
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,160
 that flying disk again.

426
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:58,280
 And what happened was that there was a lightning coming from the sky, and he was attacked by

427
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,720
 this lightning right on his head.

428
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:14,320
 So, he fainted, and during the time that he was out, he felt that aliens were communicating

429
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,760
 with him.

430
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:26,800
 He had a lot of physical reactions, and he claimed that aliens had implanted some objects

431
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,480
 into his body.

432
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:39,520
 And after that, this alien also had sexual contact with him.

433
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,880
 And after that, he was told that this sexual contact is a very --

434
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,920
 Anything you can refer to that would show something that could make the Chinese government

435
00:29:50,920 --> 00:30:00,680
 or any other government aware of any of this, to make this story so far, which is a pretty

436
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,840
 significant story, of course, but to make it accepted by -- does the Chinese government

437
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
 know about this story?

438
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,080
 Let me put it that way.

439
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,960
 Have they commented on it, and what evidence has been given to them about the story you

440
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,160
 just outlined?

441
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:24,320
 Well, we have a lot of evidence in this event.

442
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:32,240
 We have gathered more than 100 people and conducted more than a dozen of investigations.

443
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:47,800
 We have used lie detectors to test and verify the truthfulness of the things that these

444
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,280
 people are claiming.

445
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:58,080
 So we have gathered information, and we have done investigation in this area.

446
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,640
 And so in this incident, we have seen this very special interaction between aliens and

447
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
 humans.

448
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,920
 Would you say, then, that Phoenix Mountain would be your prime case, rather than, say,

449
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:17,880
 the Beijing Zoukong event, in terms of the question I asked, which is your best evidence

450
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,400
 of extraterrestrial involvement, or an alien, which you've certainly described -- you've

451
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,800
 described aliens with more activities than anybody else has described them in the three

452
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
 or four days here.

453
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,440
 And so I just want to know to what extent the Chinese government is really aware or

454
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,320
 believes it, or -- and that doesn't necessarily prove it one way or the other, by any means,

455
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,220
 but I just want to know where documentation can be, where we can start working on this

456
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,960
 case, because it's kind of an interesting one, very interesting one.

457
00:31:51,960 --> 00:32:00,240
 Right, the Chinese government, I think they know, because this incident was very, very

458
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,800
 hotly spread within the country.

459
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
 Everybody knows.

460
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,600
 It's very popular.

461
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,640
 It was reported everywhere.

462
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:21,240
 But after more than 10 years of research and investigation and verification, as well as

463
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:31,200
 evidence collection, which included the tracks that the UFOs have left in the mountains,

464
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,640
 and the trees and the plants that were destructed by their landing, we have gathered all those

465
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,500
 evidence.

466
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,640
 And we have also brought a scientist to --

467
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
 I understand.

468
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
 I appreciate it.

469
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
 Thank you for your testimony.

470
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,160
 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

471
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
 Thank you.

472
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
 Thank you.

473
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:59,180
 We're down to you, Representative -- yes, not -- I'm sorry, Senator Gravel.

474
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:06,080
 I would like to address -- first of all, I have a question for all of you, but following

475
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:14,320
 on, a colleague was just saying, what is the reaction of your government towards the transparency

476
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
 of this whole subject?

477
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:21,840
 As we know, the U.S. is very deficient, and probably the highest standard we've run across

478
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,720
 thus far is Uruguay, where it's so transparent that they even go to the effort to educate

479
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,520
 people in school with Air Force personnel.

480
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,040
 In China, is the government transparent about this?

481
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,880
 Is there an official position in that regard?

482
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,320
 What's your government position?

483
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
 Okay.

484
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,360
 Let me begin first, then.

485
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,320
 Our government, my government, in a lot of international conferences, a lot of media

486
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,200
 workers have asked me about these questions.

487
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
 Okay.

488
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
 My answer is this.

489
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,520
 This is to be open and to be objective and be pragmatic.

490
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,040
 And another thing is that being cautious, that is very -- this is a very -- the position

491
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:24,320
 is that to be cautious, where the reason that we need to open up is because China is going

492
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,440
 through the opening up and transparent.

493
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,880
 So under this kind of circumstance, we can talk about this.

494
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,400
 And also, the government is not very strict about keeping everything secret.

495
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:42,520
 For example, in the Air Force, that they have the combat with the UFO, and that we have

496
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,960
 interview on all those of the stories, and they told us truthfully of their encounter.

497
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,200
 And sometimes the militaries, when they don't understand of some certain situations, they

498
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,580
 even come to us, they consult us.

499
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,600
 So we will try to relay some of the information on UFO to them.

500
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,240
 And, however, we still be very cautious and vigilant as well.

501
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,580
 They don't want to take a non-scientific way of approach of studying UFO.

502
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,800
 They don't want to mix with anything that is not scientific.

503
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,720
 So they don't want any distractions.

504
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:26,160
 If only a purely a UFO incident or an ET incident, and the government will not interfere with

505
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,200
 any investigation, that would give us a more lax situation.

506
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,520
 That's commendable on the part of your government.

507
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:41,480
 I just have one general question, and I apologize for excusing myself earlier.

508
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:50,060
 Is anybody familiar with Dr. Wood, a woman, PhD on directed energy?

509
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:55,280
 She has written extensively about the use of directed energy to bring down the Twin

510
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,520
 Towers on 9/11.

511
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,520
 Are any of you, or maybe this is a question for the scientific panel tomorrow, or certainly

512
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:13,880
 my colleague here, but has any of you run across the issue of directed energy with respect

513
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:23,240
 to the UFO or the energy that obviously they possess that we don't understand for propulsion?

514
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,600
 And I would start with my colleague from Italy.

515
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:32,520
 A consideration may be done in the case of unidentified submerged objects.

516
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:42,280
 As far as we know, when they are in the hydrosphere, these objects, well, they do not are in direct

517
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,440
 contact with the water.

518
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:52,720
 It seems that they are covered by a sort of pillow of energy.

519
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:59,040
 And this prevents any contact with the shell, you understand, with the hull.

520
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,040
 And probably what Antonio Neus said before is to be connected with this.

521
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:14,720
 It's the same kind probably of propulsion mean, a sort of electromagnetic propulsion

522
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:25,360
 which permits these objects to move in any kind of environment, deep space without any

523
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,520
 kind of atmosphere, like our astronauts said.

524
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,640
 Any kind of atmosphere, ours or any other planet's.

525
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,400
 And of course, also a more dense environment like water.

526
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:48,680
 So as far as we know, probably there is a definite pattern in all this, in the possibility

527
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:55,160
 of an electromagnetic and anti-gravity system.

528
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:02,880
 Frankly, we still have to learn a lot about this.

529
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
 Thank you.

530
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,800
 Any other comments on that?

531
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,560
 Senator, yes, and with apologies for not having printed this off for the committee, but it

532
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,160
 was 468 pages, I can supply a hyperlink.

533
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,600
 We accept that apology.

534
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,040
 Though the Ministry of Defence were talking about the possibility that some UFOs were

535
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:29,720
 exotic plasmas, three sentences might be directly relevant to your question from Project Condine's

536
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
 final report.

537
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,680
 It says, "There is evidence from openly published scientific papers that scientists in the former

538
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,960
 Soviet Union have taken a particular interest in UFO phenomena.

539
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,480
 They have identified the close connection with plasma technologies and are pursuing

540
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,440
 related technologies for potential military purposes.

541
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,480
 For example, very high-power energy generation, RF weapons, impulse radars, air vehicle drag

542
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,120
 and radar signature reduction or control, and possibly for radar-reflecting decoys."

543
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,840
 Antonio, please.

544
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
 Yes, Senator.

545
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,840
 I just wanted to add that one of the first people that looked at the propulsion systems

546
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,240
 of UFOs was one of the most qualified persons because it was Professor Hermann Oberth, who

547
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,000
 was one of the fathers of the Space Age.

548
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,080
 As you know, the Space Age has three fathers, Tsiolkovsky in Russia, Robert Goddard in the

549
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,360
 United States, and Oberth in Germany.

550
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,680
 He was the mentor of von Braun, and he later worked for us too, like many of the German

551
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,680
 scientists from Operation Paperclip and that whole episode.

552
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,520
 But Oberth in the '50s became very interested in ufology, so one of the guys that invented

553
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
 rocket.

554
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,040
 He wrote the classic book about the rocket into interplanetary space.

555
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,280
 This was published in German in 1922, a long time before the Nazis, and so it was a brilliant

556
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
 man.

557
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,800
 I'm honored that I met him when he was like something like 96 years old.

558
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,680
 I didn't speak German, so I cannot say that I interviewed him, but at least I had the

559
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,360
 pleasure of meeting one of the fathers of the Space Age.

560
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,440
 I had to go to his house near Nuremberg.

561
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:20,160
 But he had wrote some papers, some articles, and obviously he was eminently qualified.

562
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,800
 The technical things I would have to look in my notes, so I don't want to speculate.

563
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,840
 One of the things he had to say, though, is because of the maneuverability, the change

564
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:37,680
 of course and 90-degree changes, turns, and things like that, the pilots or whoever beings

565
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,720
 were inside these objects had to be shielded from the rest of it, otherwise they would

566
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,800
 be crushed to death, he said.

567
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,080
 These were some papers he wrote in the 1950s.

568
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,960
 Actually in the Rockefeller briefing document that I co-authored, in the quotation section

569
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,360
 we do have some key quotes from Herman Oberth, but if you're interested I can get you some

570
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,080
 other articles that he published about this subject.

571
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,360
 There's another American scientist who used to work for NASA, Paul Hill, I believe was

572
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:13,200
 his name, who wrote a book after his death, I think his daughter had found these notes

573
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,840
 or whatever, and it was called "Conventional Flying Objects."

574
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,560
 That's a pretty serious, sober, highly technical discussion of propulsion.

575
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,320
 So there's been many people that, well, not many, but there've been a few qualified people.

576
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,800
 There are some other not qualified, I would disregard those, but at least there are a

577
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
 few.

578
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,400
 There was another German who used a pseudonym, Ross Sigma, who wrote and published a book

579
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,840
 called "Ether Technologies."

580
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,920
 That was not his real name.

581
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,520
 I think his real name was Schneider Franken or something like that.

582
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:53,000
 I think he had maybe worked in Penemunde also, Gordon Cooper, the astronaut Gordon Cooper

583
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 knew him.

584
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,640
 Gordon Cooper was very, very much interested in the UFO phenomenon.

585
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,720
 So yeah, there are several leads, although I'm sure that there are plenty more, but that

586
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
 would be classified.

587
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
 Great.

588
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,720
 Thank you very much.

589
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,520
 Madam Chairman, I reserve the time or share the time with anybody who wants to use it.

590
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,960
 Congresswoman Kilpatrick.

591
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,200
 Thank you, Madam Chair.

592
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,920
 I was happy to hear in this afternoon's session after three and a half days being here that

593
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:31,800
 Mr. Juneyus, Pope, and Cameron did say the U.S. has participated a bit.

594
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,960
 I've been led to believe up until an hour ago that we hadn't done anything and that

595
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,440
 we were the big bear in the room.

596
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,360
 So I'm glad to hear that you acknowledge that we've done something.

597
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,480
 Yes, absolutely.

598
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,360
 You further went on to say the CIA was sued and released theirs in 1977.

599
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,680
 I think you said that, Mr. Juneyus, which is good.

600
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
 I don't want you...

601
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
 Yeah.

602
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,680
 There's a little editorial right here, that's all.

603
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,600
 Then the FBI did file a suit later and released it.

604
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,240
 I think, Mr. Cameron, you said, yeah, they released it.

605
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,180
 They're sitting files, but not the real thing.

606
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,160
 I think my question on all of that, releasing of the files, and I'm glad they did it, ordered

607
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,600
 by the court or otherwise, and that you all acknowledge that.

608
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,520
 It's good for our country to know that, for us here on the panel, for sure.

609
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,080
 Did they acknowledge, do they believe that UFOs are real or not?

610
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,020
 Did they address after releasing the files, or they just gave you paper and you had to

611
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,020
 shift through them?

612
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,840
 I know we didn't get to meet one again, but did they say one way or the other, whether

613
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,520
 UFOs are real or that extraterrestrial is a real phenomenon?

614
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,320
 Well, I mean, the problem is that the files they released are sort of the mundane files,

615
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,160
 like grants at the siting files, or they're very old, historical files.

616
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,280
 Siting files means that they cited something somewhere.

617
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,320
 Correct, but what we would want to see is some kind of conclusion, and those kind of

618
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,320
 documents seem to be-

619
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,320
 They were not included.

620
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
 Yeah.

621
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,800
 I mean, there are some conclusions, for instance, in the Condon Report, which was this famous

622
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,120
 project by the University of Colorado, but that was distorted, too, because they wanted

623
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,480
 to close Blue Book.

624
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,600
 Now, some of the case histories in the Condon Report are valid, and actually about 30 percent

625
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:17,520
 of the case histories in the Condon Report are unexplained.

626
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,600
 That's how much you will find in the U.S. files, that there are a certain percentage

627
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,880
 of cases that are unexplained.

628
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,760
 So how would you sum what they've released, and do you know of a U.S. ... Can we conclude

629
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,080
 a position from our government on this issue, based on what they've released with CIA or

630
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,080
 FBI?

631
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,080
 Yes.

632
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,080
 The truth is, it's confusing.

633
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,440
 I mean, some people, like there is Colonel John Alexander.

634
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,040
 He was involved in some study at the Pentagon in the 1980s.

635
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,000
 So this would have been much, much later, when there wasn't Blue Book, all that was

636
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,640
 old history, and he claims it was not a formal project in the sense that they had to issue

637
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,480
 reports and things, but it was obviously tolerated by his superiors, and they went around and

638
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,200
 they briefed a number of people, including high-level people, like admirals and generals

639
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,400
 and General Abramson, the head of the Star Wars SDI project, and people like that, very

640
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
 high-level people.

641
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,440
 And he wrote a book about this, so I'm not revealing anything that is unknown.

642
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,720
 So they would brief these people, because this group of scientists that all had clearances

643
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,880
 and were working within the Pentagon on the military-industrial complex, would brief these

644
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,880
 generals and staff, because they thought that there was some kind of big project going on,

645
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,880
 according to Alexander.

646
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,680
 And then what would happen, if you read his book, is that most of these generals or admirals

647
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,200
 say, "No, we don't have anything.

648
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,280
 I mean, we have no project."

649
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,280
 So that was the official record, but he tells in his book some anecdotes that then after

650
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,160
 the official meeting was over, then the admiral will come and whisper to him, "But let me

651
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,080
 tell you about my sighting."

652
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,800
 So this is the kind of stuff you encounter.

653
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,600
 That's kind of soft, but there was something.

654
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,600
 There was something.

655
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
 It was something.

656
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
 Okay.

657
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
 Yes.

658
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,480
 Mr. Cameron, thank you very much, Mr. Honest.

659
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,180
 You said, Mr. Cameron, that we were waiting for America to make the first move.

660
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,280
 What move would that be?

661
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,120
 What do you speak when you say that?

662
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,000
 The move to disclosure, to identifying the fact that it's an ET phenomena or whatever

663
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 it is, I have heard stories from other governments, sort of off the record, they were asked, "Will

664
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 you disclose?"

665
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,760
 And they said, "As soon as the Americans disclose, we'll be a close second."

666
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,480
 I've heard stories like that.

667
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,640
 That's where I think the American sort of, especially when it comes to NATO, if you take

668
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,040
 a look at the NATO thing, America is basically the main thing in NATO.

669
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,160
 Everybody sort of takes their lead.

670
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,160
 They have a lot of power.

671
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,700
 I think it's the same thing in this field that ...

672
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,120
 So the world is waiting for the US to say yay or nay on UFOs?

673
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,840
 Or set the policy or determine ...

674
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
 Or set the policy?

675
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,560
 Set ... Well, the policy is basically sort of being set by the Americans.

676
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,840
 I thought the Americans hadn't done much on it.

677
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,680
 Well, I mean, as I say, I think they've disclosed stuff.

678
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,440
 They have ... I mean, and they have disclosed a lot of documents.

679
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,440
 I mean, if you get to documents ...

680
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,440
 You said that.

681
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,600
 The United States Library has disclosed thousands of pages of documents.

682
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,600
 And so, I mean, there are documents.

683
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,920
 It's the official conclusions.

684
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,920
 It's the official ...

685
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,160
 There are no conclusions from the documents.

686
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,880
 Yeah, like the real top secret documents you won't find no matter what country you go to.

687
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,760
 And our country has not concluded ...

688
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,360
 It's still on the position that there's nothing to it.

689
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,280
 And every other government, I think, goes by that and takes the same position.

690
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,280
 That is a position.

691
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,680
 If you said they've released the files under court order, CIA and FBI ...

692
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,680
 Under FOIA.

693
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,680
 There's a lot under FOIA.

694
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,680
 Under FOIA.

695
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,680
 Okay.

696
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,680
 And they also sued them.

697
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,680
 It's, you know, 1977.

698
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,680
 Yeah.

699
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,680
 So, they have concluded.

700
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,880
 They released some, and they've concluded there is none.

701
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
 That's their official conclusion.

702
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,880
 Yeah.

703
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,880
 All right.

704
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,880
 Okay.

705
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,880
 That's good.

706
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,480
 Dr. Shelley, I'd like to spend the rest of my time with you just a bit before I yield

707
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,480
 back.

708
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,000
 Tell me about the Chinese UFO Federation.

709
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,560
 Is it an NGO unrelated to the government?

710
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,560
 What is its mission?

711
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,760
 Yes.

712
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,360
 It is an NGO.

713
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,560
 This is a private NGO.

714
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:31,080
 What is the work of the federation?

715
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:37,960
 Our mission is that in the field of UFO, we conduct scientific research, and in recent

716
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:44,520
 years, what the senator has asked, we have conducted many scientific research.

717
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:56,000
 To give you an example, that I have in the conference, in the Marino, there was a general

718
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,520
 cursor, a colonel cursor.

719
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:08,840
 He is also a very famous expert on the Roswell case, and he worked in the Department of Defense

720
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,680
 Pentagon.

721
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:18,440
 And after, he said that he embraced me and hugged me, and then he gave me a book on the

722
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:25,960
 Roswell, and he says that for Professor Sun, my greatest friend, I believe that a person

723
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:33,200
 like you will help everybody to create a new world.

724
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:41,600
 This was from a former Patagon official who was so excited after learning about our scientific

725
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,800
 research results.

726
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:55,400
 Now, we have a technology to turn water into anything, into fuel, into food, turning stone

727
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,120
 into food and into food.

728
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,760
 We are researching on these new technologies.

729
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,320
 We have many new things, new scientific research like this.

730
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:12,880
 We're now trying to find where aliens come from so that we can be inspired by them in

731
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,040
 the scientific area.

732
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:26,160
 But when saying that, we do have some scientific research and results in some particular areas

733
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,160
 already.

734
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:34,760
 So why did I say that we all have this nature to find our roots?

735
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,760
 I think that's in our DNA.

736
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:43,520
 The other one that you are very much involved in is the China UFO Research Institute established

737
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,140
 in 1980.

738
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,280
 What is it?

739
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,680
 How does it work?

740
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,680
 What is its mission?

741
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:59,600
 Yes, the mission for this institute is to explore UFO issues scientifically.

742
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:09,480
 We go to conferences and we also are interviewed constantly by international as well as domestic

743
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,480
 media.

744
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:22,480
 As I mentioned, the AP, CNN, BBC, this institute has been interviewed by all these media.

745
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,160
 And personally, I have been interviewed many, many times too.

746
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,120
 So actually, there are two faults.

747
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:36,200
 People who are engaged in these institutes, first, they are personally very interested

748
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,600
 in this topic.

749
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:47,360
 And also we have experts who are experts in areas such as how to make airplanes and astronomy

750
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,640
 and science.

751
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:54,640
 These experts use their expertise to do research.

752
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,080
 That is why this institute has been commended by the society.

753
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:07,800
 Originally, some people think that this is just for chit chat, but we have elevated this

754
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:16,800
 topic, this issue, onto a higher level where we talk about how learning about UFOs, learning

755
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:23,920
 about aliens, can help us solve environmental problems and health problems.

756
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:32,040
 And is the Federation or the institute located in any other countries outside of China?

757
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:37,760
 Do you have branches anywhere else in the world?

758
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:50,360
 Yes, we do have branches outside of China.

759
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:59,560
 And other places, and they are not necessarily called an institute or a federation.

760
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:05,400
 They are called maybe called a UFO club or association.

761
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,360
 So through these branches, we can collaborate.

762
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,360
 In fact, we are interacting with aliens already.

763
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:20,200
 They carry on the missions of both of the federation and of the institute.

764
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,200
 Question?

765
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,360
 Yes, they do.

766
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,000
 They carry on the programs.

767
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 Right.

768
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 Similar.

769
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:35,800
 Particularly, we have a World Chinese UFO federation.

770
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,600
 I'm the chairman for that federation.

771
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:45,320
 So how are the institute and the federation funded?

772
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
 How do you operate?

773
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,920
 I've got a minute left and you've got it.

774
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,920
 How are you?

775
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,120
 How do you carry on your program?

776
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,240
 How are you funded?

777
00:53:53,240 --> 00:54:00,480
 Well, about funding, we are purely a private NGO.

778
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,880
 So well, the government is very busy.

779
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,560
 They don't have time to take care of us.

780
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:12,820
 So well, symbolically, they give us very little funding.

781
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,600
 So I have a very, very tough job.

782
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:23,500
 Because I have to think about how this federation and how this institute can survive.

783
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,600
 I have to find the funding.

784
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:37,840
 Some scientists and inventors have to prove that their research is viable, and that's

785
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,840
 my job.

786
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:44,400
 I have to let people know that what we're doing is viable so that we can find enough

787
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,400
 funding.

788
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,120
 I know that it's very difficult.

789
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:57,520
 I'd like to know if any of you could tell us, the panel, whether in any of the disclosures

790
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,520
 you're aware of from government entities or from non-government, well, it would have to

791
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,840
 be government entities, obviously, or from the United States.

792
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:15,240
 It doesn't have to be your government, your country, any government, where gun, camera,

793
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:22,720
 footage, or files on analysis of materials have ever been released.

794
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,640
 Go ahead, Mr. Pope.

795
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:33,640
 The United Kingdom certainly did have some cases where military jets were sent up to

796
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,360
 intercept UFOs being tracked on radars.

797
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,800
 Similar to the Peru incident that we talked about this morning.

798
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,800
 Correct, sir.

799
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,800
 Okay, go ahead.

800
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:47,080
 If some gun, camera, footage was taken, and certainly I'm aware of on-the-record testimony

801
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:52,600
 from former MOD officials saying they've seen it, to the best of my knowledge, none of that

802
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,000
 material has survived, and I've not seen it personally, but it certainly existed at

803
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 MOD.

804
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,640
 So it's not released, but you know it exists?

805
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,640
 It existed.

806
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,440
 I believe it's lost or destroyed.

807
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,440
 Okay.

808
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:14,480
 Can I ask this final, if I have 30 seconds, is anybody aware of a, well let me get this

809
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:23,240
 question in please, anybody, is anybody aware of a military person or a contractor for the

810
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:30,360
 military that's been released from a secrecy oath that they might have taken on the subject

811
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:36,760
 of UFOs from any country, again, your own or the U.S. or any other country?

812
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:43,920
 In the case of Italy, we had in San Marino in 2000, the chief of the Reparto Generale

813
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:50,400
 Sicurezza of the Italian Air Force who came in uniform to have a presentation of the UFO

814
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,680
 data, of the official UFO data, in the San Marino Congress.

815
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,680
 This man today is retired and would have been here if possible.

816
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:17,160
 He did not come because he told me he signed a sort of security statement for 20 years

817
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:25,120
 not to speak on these subjects, even if, after all, what he said in San Marino in 2000 is

818
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,940
 open, and this is curious.

819
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,940
 Anybody else?

820
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,520
 I can give you just a quick example I mentioned, I think, in my testimony.

821
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:39,800
 Dick DiMatto, who worked for Senator Byrd, was given authorization to go to Area 51 to

822
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:44,300
 see if they're spending money on flying saucers and Aurora and all this kind of stuff.

823
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,480
 He met with Alfred O'Donnell.

824
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:55,360
 He offered him complete clearance from any sort of security oaths he had taken, and O'Donnell

825
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,360
 refused to talk.

826
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,200
 But Dick DiMatto did make that offer.

827
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,880
 So there's been an offer?

828
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,880
 There was an offer.

829
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,880
 He refused to talk.

830
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,880
 We're out of time.

831
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,880
 Thank you.

832
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,880
 We're out of time.

833
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,880
 Thank you.

834
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:14,120
 I have a couple of quick questions, hopefully.

835
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,120
 Anyone can answer.

836
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:20,320
 I'd like to hear from all of you if we can do it in a short period of time.

837
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:29,160
 What are the practical steps that we can do to take this issue forward, and is an international

838
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,560
 cooperative like the United Nations a possibility?

839
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:37,140
 Yes, there is a possibility.

840
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:46,160
 You know that the Grenada resolution was simply frozen, and any member state of the United

841
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:53,700
 States could take this resolution and to put it into the agenda.

842
00:58:53,700 --> 00:59:06,520
 Then we will have a vote from the United Nations, and we will see if by case this commission,

843
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:12,920
 permanent commission for UFOs in the United Nations, may be created or not.

844
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:18,920
 Personally, I tried to do something with the San Marino Republic, which is a member state

845
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:24,040
 of the United Nations, but frankly, I had some problems.

846
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:32,320
 We had some problems, because the first question they asked me is, "Okay, but what do you think

847
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,280
 the United States government may think about this?"

848
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,720
 I have nothing else to say.

849
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,720
 Okay.

850
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,720
 Antonio?

851
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:48,920
 The UN, of course, would be excellent in my conversations with the different heads of

852
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,680
 the South American agencies.

853
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:56,620
 They're eager, because they feel that they have these programs, which most of them have

854
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:04,720
 started recently, except Uruguay, who were the pioneers, but they have nowhere to report,

855
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,280
 so I mean, officially.

856
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:14,720
 Some place where the data could begin to be officially and legally marshalled in one single

857
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:20,160
 place, so that would be a step that would be excellent.

858
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,160
 But the problem of the UN, it has to be a member state has to bring it up.

859
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:31,120
 In the case of Granada, Prime Minister Gary was almost obsessed with the subject, so he

860
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:36,080
 had a mission, and he pursued it, as we know, for many years, until he was overthrown, because

861
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,360
 he wasn't taking care of the business in his own country.

862
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,360
 He was spending so much time in New York that he was disregarding, even though he was the

863
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,520
 founding father of that island.

864
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:53,120
 Then, I don't know, it would be nice to have congressional hearings, but I appreciate your

865
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:59,200
 work here greatly, but with people who are currently in Congress, because then the oath,

866
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:05,080
 and then you could really bring officials, and by subpoena if necessary, and really try

867
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,760
 to get to the bottom of this.

868
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:13,440
 There's so much allegations and rumours, and probably half of those are false, and maybe

869
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,860
 the US government is getting a bad rep, but it's partly their own fault, because of so

870
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:26,280
 much secrecy, and we could, what is really happening in Area 51, have we incorporated

871
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,600
 some of this technology into weapons?

872
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,220
 There's all these kinds of allegations, but because we're dealing with classified areas,

873
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,360
 it's impossible to know, and so that would be another step.

874
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:41,720
 If the other countries of the world saw that there were hearings in the US and stuff like

875
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:47,200
 that, probably they would do the same, then it would give cover to a lot of other countries,

876
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,920
 even though many countries, as you know, are trying and are releasing files, and in South

877
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,320
 America especially, they're creating agencies.

878
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,680
 Those would be two good steps, and they're probably others too.

879
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,680
 Thank you.

880
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,960
 Mr. Pope?

881
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:11,120
 The head of the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs attended a Royal Society discussion

882
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,040
 meeting in the UK in 2010.

883
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:19,040
 Now, I hasten to add that was an astrobiology meeting, and not a UFO meeting, but it did

884
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:24,800
 discuss in a speculative way some of the issues that might arise, be they religious, scientific,

885
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:32,320
 and technical, societal, if we did detect extraterrestrial life or even another civilization,

886
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:39,440
 but she said that when it comes to the role of the UN, one must approach the UN with consensus

887
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,200
 on this sort of issue, so I don't think there's much practical hope of that.

888
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:50,600
 On regard to your other question about practical steps that could be taken, I think one meaningful

889
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:56,840
 step would be to incorporate whatever you believe about UFOs, some module into pilot

890
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:02,480
 training, because whatever the government says or does about UFOs, civil and military

891
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,440
 pilots, do continue to see these things.

892
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,440
 Great idea.

893
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,440
 Thank you.

894
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,000
 Mr. Cameron?

895
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,960
 I would agree with an international United Nations type thing.

896
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,920
 I don't think congressional will help, because it doesn't help anybody, it doesn't help you

897
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,480
 to get elected, which is what it's all about.

898
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:28,320
 In terms of this week, I think we're no different than any other social or political movement,

899
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:32,520
 no matter how important we think we are, and when the time is right, it'll happen, and

900
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,160
 we have to keep making moves, and I think the move we've made this week to do this is

901
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,800
 a step ahead, so we are making steps.

902
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,680
 And it's like the women's right to vote, it started in 1848, they didn't get the right

903
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,080
 to vote until 1920, and even then their problems weren't solved.

904
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,080
 We're no different.

905
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,520
 We've got to make moves, we've got to put pressure on, that's how I think it's going

906
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,520
 to happen.

907
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,520
 Thank you.

908
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,520
 Dr. Shelley?

909
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,520
 Yes.

910
01:03:53,520 --> 01:04:06,840
 I've talked about, I'm trying to facilitate a summit meeting to talk about UFO and the

911
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:14,320
 universe, and universal exploration, and not only that, and we have, as a humankind, we've

912
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:19,560
 encountered many problems, probably in this summit, we'll be able to solve some of the

913
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,560
 difficulties.

914
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:26,600
 Now, we are trying to cohere the strength of all of the world.

915
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:36,360
 Now, I'm trying to form a committee of the thinkers of our world, and try to gather all

916
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,960
 the intellectuals around the world together, and also that we should come to a conclusion

917
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:52,880
 on all the cases, and a few years ago, some experts, that some of the people that advised

918
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,680
 that Senator Goldwater, whether he could conduct investigation or promote investigation of

919
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:05,520
 the Area 51, he did not believe about this Area 51, and I was very honored he invited

920
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,520
 me.

921
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:14,200
 So, we had a small group formed, and Senator Goldwater was a chair, and it was a co-chair,

922
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:22,020
 and then, regretfully, he was quite old at the time, and he went to the hospital, so

923
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:28,000
 he asked his secretary to apologize for me, for the success of this forming a group, so

924
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,400
 you can see that for such a prestigious person to be involved in the investigation, if we

925
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,320
 can get somebody like that, we will come to a fruitful conclusion.

926
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,800
 This is a very major event.

927
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:48,280
 If, after the investigation, and we come to a conclusion that there is no UFO or ET, then

928
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,280
 that's fine, but if we can verify there is actually UFO and ET, that's great.

929
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,920
 Mr. Pinotti, you already gave your answer to this one, didn't you?

930
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,920
 Excuse me?

931
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,200
 Did you give your answer to this question?

932
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,200
 Yes.

933
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
 I think you did, yeah.

934
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
 You started.

935
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:12,800
 The problem of interacting on international level, and having the possibility to bring

936
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:20,440
 this argument to the attention of United Nations and so on, is a big one.

937
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:27,720
 I think that, probably, little nations may be more interested.

938
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,520
 Big nations may have big problems.

939
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:38,240
 In fact, as I told you before, I tried to move something with the Little Republic of

940
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,200
 San Marino, since this could be extremely simple.

941
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:50,000
 But there are problems, because you see, for instance, in Italy, even if we have an official

942
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:59,040
 UFO group in the Italian Air Force, we have the facts, but we have no study, in the sense

943
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:03,400
 that our military say, we are all involved in defense.

944
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,400
 That's all.

945
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,640
 We don't like to draw any conclusion.

946
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:16,280
 If we still have this attitude at the political level, everywhere, we will not be able to

947
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,280
 do anything.

948
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:22,960
 I think that we must change our mentality, our way of thinking.

949
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:30,240
 We should be aware of the fact that we are facing something absolutely new and absolutely

950
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,260
 real and absolutely from outside.

951
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:40,920
 Don't remember that the first UFO sightings occurred in Europe, and particularly in Italy,

952
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,200
 in the '30s.

953
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,240
 They were advanced, intelligent, piloted crafts.

954
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:51,120
 They were studied by the fascist government.

955
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,440
 We knew this up to some years ago.

956
01:07:53,440 --> 01:08:00,920
 But if this is true, and this is true, this means that these objects do not come from

957
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,480
 the Earth.

958
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,960
 They come from outside the Earth.

959
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:11,440
 And if this is true, we should be aware that we are facing an historical argument.

960
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:19,020
 We are still discussing, and from a sociological point of view, I think that we are not too

961
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:35,880
 different from the Carbocult people who spoke in the Pacific after World War II about the

962
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:46,560
 passing airplanes, and that they thought they were some kind of divine means and so on.

963
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:55,360
 Apart from this, we do not know the origin of this intelligence and of these crafts,

964
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:04,520
 but what is sure that we are sufficiently lucky that this intelligence are not hostile,

965
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,620
 and this is not too much, frankly.

966
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:13,980
 What we should do, I think, is just to be aware of this and to try to understand more,

967
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,520
 but all together.

968
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:26,440
 Otherwise, if we still continue to be separated state by state, we won't do any conclusion.

969
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:33,120
 Thank you very much.

970
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,840
 Senator Gravel, you have three minutes left.

971
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:42,120
 Thank you, Madam Chairman.

972
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:55,000
 Going along with your recommendations, I had suggested earlier that, and I think Mr. Cameron

973
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:03,960
 has shared that same view, is that another hearing, whether it's like this one or whether

974
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:10,080
 it's in the Congress, probably won't advance our goals all that much.

975
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:16,780
 But there's no reason why, with the various countries represented here, with the various

976
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:25,120
 scholars and military officers, that we would try to, within our own communities, to get

977
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:31,200
 them to endorse a resolution, a very simple, straightforward resolution, calling upon the

978
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:38,200
 General Assembly, not get waylaid to the Security Council, because that's a dead letter also,

979
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:45,820
 but to take the matter to the General Assembly, all we would need is one country.

980
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:50,520
 But I think that we have several countries from South America, and certainly this group

981
01:10:50,520 --> 01:11:00,560
 here might have enough influence to get their government to go on record and to field a

982
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:10,720
 resolution creating an agency of the United Nations without a lot of powers defined, but

983
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:18,040
 specifically with the goal to organize a global conference, not a hearing, a global conference

984
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:26,440
 of the scholars and scientists and whoever that would come together, and to fund it both

985
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:34,960
 from public and private sources, so that within a couple of years we could convene a conference

986
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,360
 that would command the attention of the world.

987
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:45,400
 I have no doubt, and I at one point in my career was a delegate to the United Nations

988
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:51,580
 from the Senate for four months, and I have no doubt that we could field that kind of

989
01:11:51,580 --> 01:12:00,120
 a resolution and get it adopted, and then it would be the responsibility, or that would

990
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:05,560
 be the aegis of it all that would carry it forward, and then we could all have something

991
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,360
 now to hang our hats on.

992
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:14,020
 Right now we're hanging our hat on the fine work that has been putting together this particular

993
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:20,920
 conference, but we can elevate it one notch higher, and not one notch higher, I mean we

994
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:26,780
 can elevate it right to where it really belongs, because it's a global issue, we could elevate

995
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:38,640
 it right to the General Assembly of the United Nations.

996
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:47,340
 I have a draft that Danny was kind enough that Antonio, we're preparing, I'll draft

997
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:55,520
 something based upon their work, try to get it done by tomorrow, and be very simple.

998
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,720
 I mean it's not going to be controversial, we've already talked about it, or I've raised

999
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:07,560
 it with my colleagues, and this is a given, you know, so we'll have something that not

1000
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:15,320
 only the various members who have testified, members on our side of the table, and various

1001
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:24,080
 members of the public may want to sign a petition adjoining this effort, and then hope that

1002
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:29,120
 an organization, either the organization that did this, or I've talked a little bit with

1003
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:35,800
 some others that have an organization that might want to take this up and follow through,

1004
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:44,080
 raise the money to just get it, help get it to the New York, at probably the next session

1005
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:50,480
 that could treat this would be next October, next September, next October, so, and I certainly

1006
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:57,360
 myself would be happy to travel to New York and try to lobby for that, but it would take,

1007
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:05,440
 we need a country to do it, and so it's up to you to see where you have the influence

1008
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:12,720
 within your country to, and all we need is one, all we need is one, and that would be

1009
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:17,840
 the sponsor, and I'm sure once you got one country with a sponsor, several other countries

1010
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:24,280
 would follow suit and join on to it, so we could have a bevy of countries, and I think

1011
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:31,600
 just to end on this time, I would guarantee that it would pass, because there's a lot

1012
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:37,520
 of resentment in the General Assembly with respect to the conduct of the Security Council

1013
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:48,240
 in a lot of other affairs.

1014
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:54,800
 I want to thank our panel today, you have been here, and appreciate your time and your

1015
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,640
 effort and your willingness to speak up, and with that, we are adjourned.

1016
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:30,360
, thank you.
