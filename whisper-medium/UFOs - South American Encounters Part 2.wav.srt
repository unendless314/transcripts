1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
 Thank you very much.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,760
 This meeting will come back to order.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:19,880
 I am going to start out to my right with Congresswoman Woolsey, and this will be the time to ask

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,600
 questions of our witness.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,520
 Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, witnesses.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
 What a morning.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,520
 What a morning.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
 Good morning.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,800
 What a morning.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,960
 There is hardly any way to deny, unless you are all sitting here making up stories of

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:50,160
 how absolute your proof is of what's going on beyond our own earth, and so thank you

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
 for that.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,440
 That was good for all of us.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:02,880
 My first question is to our wonderful pilot, Santa Maria.

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,820
 You're Peru, you're Argentina.

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:19,880
 What I want to know is, do you have any kind of a formal relationship, your UFO group,

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,560
 with your Argentine government, and what is it, the Argentine government, and what is

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,520
 it, and how does it work, and what can we learn from that?

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:39,240
 Well, all the groups in Argentina, the civilian groups, create the Sephora, and Sephora had

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:49,080
 been unite researchers for many, many years who were my colleagues and close associates.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,840
 Some of them were disciples of myself.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,240
 I started searching UFOs many years ago.

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,880
 We always look for the classification from the '70s to now.

24
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:11,600
 The group found the cooperation now of the Air Force through the Minister of Defense,

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:21,440
 and through the executive power of the nation, we are waiting to kind of unify that motion.

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,880
 Now it's working also.

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,240
 We have a petition in the Congress of the nation, with executive power, and also with

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,800
 the Minister of Defense to have release documentations from the past.

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,560
 They were projects, as I said in my speech, and maybe the translation was not so good.

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
 Okay.

31
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:52,240
 Of these projects and the projects, not only to release, also to have cooperation.

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:00,800
 To have cooperation with the field researchers, we always work alone with no mediums to get

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
 to the places to do good analysis.

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:14,960
 We really, the groups kind of prevail so many decades with the lack of technical support

35
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
 to do analysis.

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:24,160
 We have, for example, since the 2000, we have the phenomenon of, for example, of the cattle

37
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,840
 mutilations, which is very serious.

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,280
 We know through Linda Molton, her research.

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,880
 Another example is the groups need support.

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,520
 It's not only to have the classification of documents who could give light for scientific

41
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,200
 analysis and to see what happened also in documents and cases.

42
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,000
 The Army forces and their force and the Navy research between 1960, as I explained, and

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 today.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,880
 There were recent cases too, as I said in 2011, was this big explosion.

45
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,120
 You need the information.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,960
 Are they giving it to you or are you just helping them?

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
 Yeah.

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,440
 The classification started slowly.

49
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
 Yeah.

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
 But it's actually happening.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 It's happening right now.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Yes.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's happening now.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,960
 Thank you for sharing that with us.

55
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
 Thank you.

56
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,040
 Colonel Santa Maria, I can't imagine your experience.

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:33,040
 I mean, I felt like I was sitting on your shoulder when you were telling the story.

58
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,560
 Afterward, how did your government treat you?

59
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,320
 Did they take your information and take it seriously?

60
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,800
 How could they not?

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,880
 And did you see any life in those UFOs?

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:05:05,360
 We could not actually see into the UFO, not through the ceramic part or the metallic part.

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,640
 As regards the government and the Air Force, the 1,800 people that actually saw it and

64
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,200
 the commanders that were there, we reported all of this to the Air Forces, but there was

65
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,880
 no negative repercussions because it was officially accepted.

66
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,680
 The sighting was officially accepted, and I continued to fly for 20 more years without

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,960
 any problems.

68
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:41,120
 So how did your press, did the press handle this, and I mean, what was their response?

69
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:59,240
 In 1980, when this event happened, this was a year that, on that air base, we were installing

70
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,460
 Soviet materials or Soviet installations at that place, and the UFO did not actually get

71
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,440
 to fly over the base.

72
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:17,040
 And so really, we received the order to not talk about this because we didn't actually

73
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,560
 want any curious journalists to come and actually research and investigate this because we had

74
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,240
 sensitive materials on the base, and we didn't want to attract any undue attention.

75
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,160
 And so it was 22 years of silence until the Air Force officially gave us permission to

76
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,800
 talk about these phenomenon, and that's at that time when they said that we could actually

77
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,400
 start to speak publicly about this issue.

78
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,120
 And as I said, they finally gave me the authorization to talk about this.

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,380
 And did the press come back by belittling the effort, or did they acknowledge it and

80
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,760
 support it?

81
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:11,640
 The media started to talk about this secret that we had kept for so many years, but they

82
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,600
 didn't really know how to get access to the information from the Air Force offices, and

83
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:26,920
 so the media occasionally would interview me or request an interview just to try to

84
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,800
 get the word out about this, but it was so many years later that there wasn't a whole

85
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 lot.

86
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,560
 Thank you very, very much.

87
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
 Mr. Girard.

88
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 Yes, ma'am.

89
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,520
 Can I take these off?

90
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
 Yes.

91
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
 Yeah, I'll be speaking in...

92
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
 Thank you.

93
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
 Yeah.

94
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
 Thank you.

95
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,200
 And believe me, it's because I'm limited.

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,680
 You referred to American military in the Amazon.

97
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:04,120
 How soon did that happen, and what's the relationship there?

98
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:12,760
 The facts that I described happened in the '70s, in late '70s, in '77, and Brazil was,

99
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,240
 like many other countries in South America, under military dictatorship.

100
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:26,000
 And during that period of time, U.S. military and intelligence were all over South America,

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,520
 ruling lots of things there.

102
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,160
 Now, when Operation Saucer took place, and it happened because the populations of the

103
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:42,520
 affected area couldn't live anymore because they were seeing UFOs all the time, and worse

104
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:49,000
 than that, they were being attacked, over 1,000 people were attacked.

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,800
 During a certain period of time, there were lots of injuries made by this object that

106
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:04,340
 would come from the sky and emit a beam of light towards people's body, making them faint

107
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,000
 and become anemic.

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,720
 Now, the situation went so intense that the community leaders went to the governor of

109
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,680
 the state of Pará to ask that something is done about it.

110
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,200
 And the government asked the Brazilian Air Force to start an investigation to give answers

111
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,320
 to the population, to the society.

112
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:39,520
 Then it was established, Operation Saucer, to investigate and to engage the extraterrestrial

113
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,320
 intelligences because there was already, and this is in the documents, there was already

114
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,120
 a knowledge that there was an intelligence beyond that phenomena, and that phenomena

115
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,240
 was not earthly.

116
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:04,080
 Now, when Operation Saucer started as a military operation with all the military system and

117
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:13,720
 style, during its procedures that lasted four months, and the way it was closed is very

118
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,600
 interesting.

119
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:23,680
 But during these four months, U.S. military, U.S. intelligence were visiting those areas

120
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,280
 and taking part of the operations during the Operation Saucer.

121
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:37,760
 And they were talking to the witnesses during the day and sky watching the night with full

122
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:46,800
 equipment to try to detect and film the UFOs that were being seen.

123
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,200
 Now, it was said to me by the commander of the Operation Saucer that at the beginning,

124
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,960
 in the first weeks, only a few sightings took place.

125
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:06,680
 But after the Operation Saucer went on and on, the objects would come more and more boldly

126
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,600
 into the direction of the areas where the military were camping.

127
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,920
 So was the U.S. military part of that Saucer project with you?

128
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
 Not officially.

129
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
 Were they at the table?

130
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
 Not officially.

131
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,680
 They took part in lots of procedures, including this was told to me by the commander of the

132
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:34,840
 Operation Saucer himself, Coronel Willem Jolanda, that they were having problem in documenting

133
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,760
 the UFOs with photograph.

134
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,120
 Some UFOs were hard to photograph.

135
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,480
 But they solved this problem when the U.S. military came to Brazil and gave to the Brazilian

136
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:55,480
 military some equipment and highly sensitive films so they can not only photograph the

137
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:04,260
 UFOs, over 500 pictures were made, and also film the UFOs, 16 hours of film were made

138
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,560
 of including motherships over the Amazon River.

139
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,880
 So do you have any idea of whether or not that information and those films were shared

140
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,800
 here in the United States?

141
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,360
 I don't have that information.

142
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,860
 I truly believe that.

143
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,040
 Would it have been all right?

144
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,600
 Was there some embargo in their relationship with you that would say you can't take our

145
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,840
 information back?

146
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,920
 No, I think that the whole thing about the cooperation with the Americans is that they

147
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,080
 take the information back to the United States.

148
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,280
 They were there to collect information as they were in Argentina and Chile and so many

149
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,760
 countries to get information about the dust phenomena and bring back to the United States

150
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,960
 to use for their own purposes.

151
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,160
 Well, thank you very much.

152
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:11,120
 So Mr. Junios, you mentioned that the traffic control group was housed in the Air and Space

153
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
 Museum.

154
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
 Currently.

155
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
 Yes.

156
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
 Okay.

157
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,160
 But it started out in another...

158
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,160
 Yes, the Technical School of Aeronautics.

159
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,240
 That was the office initially.

160
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:37,680
 Well, when you told us that it had been taken from one area to another, when I heard museum,

161
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,000
 I got a little concerned that it was saying this is all past and you're not going to be

162
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,280
 working on the future.

163
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:53,240
 It's not in the museum itself, it's in the museum of the Aeronautics, it's in an old

164
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
 airport.

165
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,760
 It used to be the main airport, Los Cerrillos, but what happened like it happened in many

166
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,080
 cities is the city grew too much and also was done when the runways were smaller.

167
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,440
 So eventually the airport, Los Cerrillos, is no longer functioning as an airport, but they're

168
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,480
 still using the hangars and things and they created a museum.

169
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,320
 But the facilities of the committee, the CEFAA, are annexed, but it has nothing to do with

170
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 the museum.

171
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,960
 So it worked for convenience, it worked for you.

172
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
 Yeah.

173
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
 All right.

174
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,040
 They also have an office at the main headquarters of the Civil Aviation Agency, but according

175
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,560
 to what General Bermudez told me, they'd rather be at that other place, he said, because when

176
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,400
 they are in the headquarters, if they have to make an official presentation or something,

177
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,320
 of course they can use that facility, he said, everybody's asking them questions.

178
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,240
 "Oh, what's going on with UFOs?

179
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
 Have you seen any?"

180
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,040
 So he said, "We're in the other place, nobody bothers them.

181
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,600
 They can work quietly and do their job."

182
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
 All right.

183
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,040
 I thank you and I thank you all.

184
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,840
 My time is up.

185
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,360
 Thank you.

186
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,560
 Next up we have, next up we have Ms. Kilpatrick.

187
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,840
 Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

188
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,920
 I wasn't going to start with you, Mr. Trav, but I think I will.

189
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,480
 I think you're the first that I've heard in four days who said the presence of the others

190
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:26,240
 actually attacked people that caused the Operation Saucer project to come into existence.

191
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
 Is that right?

192
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
 That's right.

193
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
 I don't think I've heard that before.

194
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
 Certainly haven't heard it in America.

195
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
 Matter of fact, it probably happened.

196
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
 Doesn't mean it didn't happen.

197
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,880
 We just haven't heard it reported like that.

198
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,360
 What year did Operation Saucer start?

199
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,880
 I'm sorry.

200
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
 What year?

201
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,600
 Oh, it started in September 1977.

202
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,560
 And how long did it end?

203
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,200
 And it ended on December 1977.

204
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,880
 It took four months only.

205
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
 Okay.

206
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
 Okay.

207
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:00,080
 And you also mentioned in this, from Congresswoman Woolsey, the U.S., did you say they took your

208
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,120
 information and you were waiting to hear back from them?

209
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,040
 Or something you were saying about, I don't know, maybe you supplied the information from

210
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,840
 Brazil in this instance, and then they were to report back or something.

211
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
 I don't know.

212
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,440
 What was your relationship with the United States of America?

213
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,040
 And this is for all of you all.

214
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:24,040
 The information on your presence, your UFOs, your whatever that's being called, what relationship,

215
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,840
 if any, did you have with the U.S. government?

216
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,280
 And did you forward or share any information from your country with the U.S. government?

217
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
 Me personally?

218
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
 No, Brazil.

219
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
 Oh, Brazil, of course.

220
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
 Brazil.

221
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
 All of it for your country.

222
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
 I mean, for your country.

223
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:46,520
 Yes, there is a common sense that the U.S. government is acting in many places of the

224
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
 world.

225
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
 Is what?

226
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,440
 Is working, operating in many places of the world collecting information about this subject.

227
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,740
 It is reported that the U.S. military have been to several countries collecting information

228
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,200
 about UFOs.

229
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:09,240
 Now, we just saw when Commander Santa Maria presented his case, a document that shows

230
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,080
 that U.S. intelligence was getting formed of what happened in La Jolla Air Force Base

231
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
 in Peru.

232
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,480
 The same thing happened in Brazil.

233
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:30,760
 In many years, we have had U.S. military coming down to Brazil and taking part of investigations

234
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
 of UFOs.

235
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,480
 And it's not only in the past, like four, five decades ago, but also in recent cases.

236
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
 Okay, stop.

237
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
 Okay.

238
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
 That's it.

239
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,920
 So, can each of you respond to that?

240
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,600
 We'll go right down the line.

241
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,480
 I just want to know what relationship, if any, does U.S. have with your experiences

242
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,360
 and your acts of what we're discussing this week?

243
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,400
 I mean, do you automatically give it to them?

244
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,120
 Is it because we have military bases there?

245
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,520
 Is it because we may get appropriations from us that you must share this?

246
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,920
 What reason and what is that connection?

247
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,720
 In the case of the CFAA, in fact, General Bermudez told me that when they created the

248
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,400
 office back in the late '90s, they contacted the American government, I guess through the

249
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:21,080
 embassy because they wanted to have some kind of formal relationship, but there was no response.

250
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
 They did not respond.

251
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
 What year was that?

252
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 No.

253
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,760
 That would have been probably late '90s.

254
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:33,460
 But they do have an agreement with not an official group, but it's called NARCAP.

255
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,920
 I think it stands for National Aviation Research Center for Anomalous Phenomena.

256
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
 Located where?

257
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:49,440
 Well, it's run by a former NASA scientist, a very serious man called Dr. Richard Haynes,

258
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
 and he is an expert on aviation cases.

259
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,260
 He's a long-time NASA scientist, very serious.

260
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,640
 So he's lectured, he's gone to Chile.

261
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,520
 They have very close relationship because he's an expert on aviation cases and the CFAA

262
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,520
 is run by the Civil Aviation.

263
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,400
 But NARCAP is not an official agency of the U.S. government.

264
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,640
 That sounds like a non-profit of some sort, and we've had some testimony here to that

265
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,040
 effect on our U.S. side that would probably equal that.

266
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
 Correct.

267
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,740
 So the other thing is what my colleague Javier was mentioning.

268
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:28,360
 If you study the American declassified UFO files, which are extensive, you will see a

269
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,760
 tremendous amount of documents, especially back in the old days, but there's still some

270
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,840
 more recent collected by various agencies, usually through the Defense Attaché Office

271
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:47,760
 or sometimes by the CIA, and it's obviously that these people are monitoring the international

272
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,080
 aspect of UFOs.

273
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,000
 And do you get, does Peru get information back from the U.S. regarding any of what you

274
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 send them?

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,360
 Well, I cannot speak for Peru.

276
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,280
 In the case of Chile, there might be some at the level of intelligence, they probably

277
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,140
 do, but then that is not revealed publicly.

278
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:12,040
 You see, what General Ben Mudez wanted was to have a formal, but because of the transparency

279
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,680
 law that would have had to be revealed publicly, so the U.S. just never responded.

280
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
 It's Brazil, Chile.

281
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,880
 Colonel Sanchez, could you respond?

282
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:35,440
 Do you share any of your information, as you testified to us this morning, with U.S. or

283
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,280
 any non-profit or other entity that may not be government?

284
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,400
 Do you share any of that with the U.S. government or a non-profit or an agency here in our country

285
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,920
 that would know what your gay has experienced?

286
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:55,980
 No, not with any civilian or military agency or U.S. government agency.

287
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,720
 There is no sharing or exchange of information.

288
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
 Thank you very much.

289
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,800
 Doctor, I want to say Choi, is that right?

290
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
 No.

291
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:12,400
 Well, the truth is, one of the conclusions you can draw after having heard the testimony

292
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,480
 of all the witnesses is that the UFO phenomenon is one of national security, and therefore

293
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,000
 the intelligence element is extremely important.

294
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,240
 As far as we understand, in Peru there is no open, formal public agreement, but there

295
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:44,760
 are indications that show that some of this information is shared with U.S. security agencies.

296
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:54,160
 There's no open public document, but there are witnesses who have noted that in the '80s,

297
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,480
 apparently a UFO fell in the San Mateo de Huancho area, and they said that there were

298
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,200
 Americans who were in that area.

299
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,680
 And I do want to remind you that in the Greer Disclosure Project, there were people who

300
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:22,280
 made statements, gave testimony, that stated that there was a U.S. Sergeant Jonathan Wangan

301
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:31,240
 who said that a UFO had crashed in northern Peru, and that there was extraction, and

302
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:40,640
 this was according to testimony, that they took some of the remains of this falling UFO.

303
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,880
 They were taken away by helicopters that were definitively not part of the Peruvian Armed

304
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
 Forces.

305
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
 Excuse me?

306
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,520
 They were not part of Peru, taken away in helicopters.

307
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,000
 What country was that who took them?

308
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:08,440
 Based on the testimony from the Steven Greer Project, apparently they were American helicopters,

309
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,600
 and that these materials were taken back to the United States.

310
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,120
 I'm going to change for Colonel Sandra Maria.

311
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:25,480
 You're a brave man to go up and down, back and forth, zip, zip, with something you don't

312
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,840
 know what it is, and you're trying to shoot it?

313
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
 That's pretty brave.

314
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,300
 I'm going to commend you for all of that.

315
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,520
 You did get away clean and free and healthy.

316
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,320
 That's a good thing, and thank you very much.

317
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,440
 I'm not sure I want to ask you that same question.

318
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,280
 I do want to go to Argentina and ask the same question.

319
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,080
 Do you, Argentina, share either with government or non-government organizations any of your

320
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,840
 experience, any of the things that you've witnessed to us today with the United States

321
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,600
 of America, either through its government or other non-profits or unaffiliated?

322
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
 Pretty sure.

323
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:10,040
 I am sure there's some kind of no open communication, but it's possible, but officially I don't

324
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:18,800
 see any kind of document or interaction between Argentina government and US agencies, yeah,

325
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 officially.

326
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
 Okay.

327
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,000
 But, regarding we were talking, also was very interesting case.

328
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:33,840
 I researched in the decade of '70, '78, there was a UFO crash between Argentina and Bolivia,

329
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:44,800
 and supporting what Dr. Choi said was an object who produced a kind of destruction of a hill,

330
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:54,360
 was a kind of a cycle shape, a structure of no identified, and the Bolivian government

331
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,720
 in the study, the Argentinian was a limit, didn't investigate, but that object was retrieved

332
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,400
 by American's helicopters too.

333
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,440
 Oh, stop, stop.

334
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
 Yes.

335
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
 Okay.

336
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,200
 You have no relationship with them, but in that instance, and other instances around

337
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,360
 the table, we have been on the scene at some of your current experiences.

338
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
 Right, yeah.

339
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
 Okay.

340
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,080
 It goes back, I want to go back to Dr. Choi for just a moment.

341
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,920
 Your point was well made in terms of national security, so do you all in South America share

342
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,680
 your information and experiences and enhance or whatever your national security is, because

343
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,840
 of what you see and how closely you live together, and just one person, and you know, I don't

344
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
 know.

345
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,400
 There is an agreement at the level of military in our South America, they share information

346
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:52,920
 about a wide variety of subjects, of items, and the UFO is one of them, it has been confirmed

347
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,120
 by top ranking military in Brazil and in other countries.

348
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:05,000
 It means, and the military level, which is, it's independent than the politics that is

349
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 a strong.

350
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,480
 Did you say independent of politics?

351
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,440
 Of politics, because presidents can come and go, but the military stay, and as they stay,

352
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,040
 they have to have a channel of communication among themselves, so they can talk about interests

353
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,000
 of each other, that applies in this country too, we just don't acknowledge it as such,

354
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 it does.

355
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,320
 Presidents change, but the military industrial complex is alive and well, and continues so.

356
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,040
 Right, I'd like to add that.

357
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,080
 Just a minute, one last question, I've got one minute.

358
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,800
 So therefore, South America, I believe this is an international issue, and that we ought

359
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,360
 to go back to our congresses and others, but I also think we ought to have UN presence,

360
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,740
 and there's been some.

361
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,000
 Will your countries help the citizens hearing on disclosure go to the UN to ask for their

362
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,520
 help in this subject, and will your countries help petition us with that?

363
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
 Yes.

364
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
 Yes, of course.

365
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
 It's what we want.

366
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
 We would like.

367
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
 You didn't say it.

368
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
 You didn't say it.

369
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
 I want to hear it.

370
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
 Okay, that's good.

371
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
 No, no, no.

372
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 I think that's good.

373
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
 That's what we want to hear.

374
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
 Thank you.

375
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,720
 Because these official agencies, they want a place where their data can be shared officially

376
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,040
 with other countries, because the UFO phenomenon, by definition, is global.

377
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,040
 Like I said, they don't care about national boundaries.

378
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
 That's our problem.

379
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,480
 They care about national security, though, and technology.

380
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,840
 So I mean, it's got to be a way to do it.

381
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,800
 I think a new opinion may know better, and so certainly more people in this room know

382
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
 better than I.

383
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,400
 Well, that is the problem, because as you know, and in Congress, I'm sure you've dealt

384
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,500
 with many issues dealing with intelligence and national security.

385
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,160
 There's all kinds of things going on under the rug, you know?

386
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,400
 I mean, informally, intelligence agencies, they have their own procedures, but those

387
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,140
 are not made public.

388
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,440
 Okay, stop, please.

389
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,660
 The United States of America knows of your instances.

390
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
 You all said that, most of you.

391
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
 They don't tell us.

392
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
 They know yours.

393
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,100
 And then they make mockery of us, and that doesn't exist.

394
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
 Well, because the U.S. government doesn't acknowledge.

395
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
 Okay, my time is out.

396
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
 I yield.

397
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
 I yield.

398
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
 I yield back.

399
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
 I know.

400
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
 But we've got to get to what we've got to get to.

401
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,400
 I want you all to know, and I commend you for all that you do and that you work together.

402
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,500
 But if our military gets your information and does whatever it does with it, and I hope

403
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,860
 to make a better world and a better global presence so that we all might live the next

404
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:21,260
 50 years, that we also work together to do that.

405
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,340
 I'm not so sure.

406
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,940
 Some work with you and some don't.

407
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,940
 We've got to open it up.

408
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,060
 We've got to address it, or there will be no universe.

409
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
 You all understand?

410
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
 Sure.

411
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,060
 All right.

412
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,060
 Thank you.

413
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
 Thank you, ma'am.

414
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
 Thank you.

415
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,060
 Representative Cook.

416
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,740
 Thank you.

417
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:47,380
 Chair, I'd like to turn to Colonel Santa Maria for a moment.

418
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:59,260
 This Department of Defense memo that's stamped in June of 1980 that was, I guess you actually

419
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:07,900
 showed this up on the screen, also is a test to your testimony, or your story, I should

420
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
 say.

421
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,080
 Then, of course, you testified about this.

422
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:19,940
 Is this memo referring directly to your experience that was, indeed, as someone's already said,

423
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:28,020
 very dramatic and had what we call here, and I think everywhere, the wow factor to it?

424
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:35,780
 Is this a memo that relates to, and are you prohibited from telling us, or something?

425
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,780
 It sounds like this happened in April.

426
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,300
 This is something with the June stamp on it.

427
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:48,580
 It looks like our Joint Chiefs of Staff ... Confirm, if you can.

428
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:54,940
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States of America have made these comments, or at

429
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,260
 least received these comments, from Peru.

430
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:10,220
 We have this in writing as a document that talks about these very experiences of shooting

431
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:20,460
 at UFOs with the statement, I have to say here, that the source has been known as credible

432
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,020
 before in all respects.

433
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:33,460
 In other words, what you experienced was not even questioned by people, and copies of this,

434
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:42,580
 CIA, the National Security Agency, I could go on.

435
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:51,900
 Is this a smoking gun, or what, for trying to open up some files here in the United States?

436
00:30:51,900 --> 00:31:04,260
 I mean ... But now I want to hear your answer, because it sounds, whether it was you or not,

437
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:10,900
 something very similar to what you said happened, it looks like in April or May, so I'm thinking

438
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,820
 it might be you they're talking about.

439
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
 Go ahead.

440
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:28,300
 In 2007, in this same building, I was invited to take part in a conference on the declassification

441
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,540
 of documents.

442
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:36,500
 There was a journalist, Edwin Cain, and there was a filmmaker, James Fox, who was making

443
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,060
 a documentary, and they turned over a copy of this document to me, and they said, "We

444
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:50,140
 would like to invite you to our country, because our country has accredited this encounter,"

445
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:58,540
 and so when I reviewed the data in 1980, the only encounter with a UFO was my encounter,

446
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:06,260
 and so the date of this memorandum was about 28 days later, so there were no other occurrences

447
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:13,100
 at the same base, so I believe in the sharing of information, you can see that this was

448
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,820
 the event being referred to.

449
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,500
 Well, thank you.

450
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,900
 And I just want everybody in this room to hear that even though, again, we have a humble

451
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:30,540
 observer that doesn't like to in any way overstate anything, that was a really strong yes to

452
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,540
 my question.

453
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,540
 It was.

454
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:43,060
 There's no other way to interpret that, and I appreciate that, and I have to say, since

455
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,380
 the way you described this, and the fact that you actually shot, I'm going to use the word

456
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,380
 bullets.

457
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,380
 I know that that's not the right word.

458
00:32:50,380 --> 00:33:00,860
 I'm not much in knowledge of Air Force weaponry and so on, but you shot at this, and are you

459
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,100
 a good marksman?

460
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:09,220
 I don't know the right word to use.

461
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:19,860
 Obviously, you shot at this, and would you repeat again what happened?

462
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:30,660
 Well, these were 22 minutes of this relationship where we went up and down and went around.

463
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,260
 It was trying to avoid me.

464
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,700
 I was pursuing it, and I was trying to fire.

465
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:47,500
 When I first fired, these were bursts of 30-millimeter shells, so they're about three centimeters

466
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:56,780
 wide, 25 centimeters long, and they can destroy a truck, a single one, and there were 64,

467
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,540
 so it was just a barrage of fire, and nothing happened at all.

468
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,540
 That's what was so surprising.

469
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
 No.

470
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,780
 The possibility of not hitting my target, it was practically impossible.

471
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:21,940
 I've won awards for marksmanship, so I have won some shooting contests, and so they were

472
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,220
 like, "Hey, you're the one who needs to go up there.

473
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:29,460
 You're the one who needs to chase this thing."

474
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,660
 I just don't want you to be quite so humble in the way you're explaining this, please,

475
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,980
 because it took a little too long to say, "Hey, he wouldn't really have missed this."

476
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,940
 Now, he didn't say it that way.

477
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,980
 He said it more carefully, but there's no question you wouldn't have missed it based

478
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:51,700
 on everything you said, and based on how those 30 caliber shells, as you've described, would

479
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
 have taken out a truck.

480
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,540
 I mean, you didn't even have to be a great shot, but they picked you because of your

481
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,500
 ability to shoot at something they were worried about, coming in on the air base.

482
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,220
 Am I correct?

483
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:12,380
 And I want you to continue with your answer, as far as what happened after you shot the

484
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,440
 way you did at it.

485
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:23,660
 Well, so I shot these birds, in our training, we are always firing on a three meter by three

486
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:33,180
 meter target, and in this case, this was a 10 meter by 10 meter objective target, so

487
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,820
 the possibility of missing was zero.

488
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:42,780
 These hit the object, and when it started to move away, I put on my post combustion

489
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:49,900
 so that I could chase it to maneuver, to try to get in position, but it's this mental exercise

490
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,620
 of how am I going to do this, and when it was moving away, I thought, how is it doing

491
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,620
 this?

492
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:02,980
 How can I better attack it, so I tried different positions until it came to the point when

493
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:09,660
 it had supersonic speed, when it would go up, I tried to get in my sights vertically,

494
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:20,540
 but when I moved to the side of the UFO at 1.3 mach, the UFO which was stopped, it achieved

495
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,580
 1.2 mach in a question of seconds without any engines.

496
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:33,860
 This is something that no craft can do, to just go from 0 to 1.2 mach vertically to reach

497
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:44,700
 my same position, this is a UFO that knew the way our aircraft worked, because it was

498
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:53,420
 able to anticipate my moves and then follow me, and then once I landed, I met with intelligence

499
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:00,540
 officers, and we looked at all catalogs to see what possible spy objects this might have

500
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:07,620
 been, but they all had some type of engine, there was nothing similar to what I had observed.

501
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:13,780
 So this was an unidentified object, and we were unaware of any type of technology on

502
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,220
 earth that existed.

503
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,740
 Will you allow me to make a comment?

504
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:24,340
 Please Mr. Troy, I'd like to hear Dr. Troy's, since you're from Peru of course.

505
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:30,780
 Thank you very much, perhaps because the commander is so humble, he has not expressed certain

506
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,260
 details, but I wanted to share something that I believe that you should know and I should

507
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
 underscore.

508
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,300
 I would ask the, if I could interrupt you for one moment, I would ask the colonel to

509
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:48,380
 nod his head yes on any detail where I'm, either yes or no, just to be sure that he's,

510
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:54,260
 because I agree, one of the problems is you have a, not a problem in my opinion, but you

511
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:00,580
 have somebody that does not like to in any way bring attention to himself or overstate

512
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:08,860
 his own abilities or what he did when he, just description, denied by our Joint Chiefs

513
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,640
 of Staff was amazing.

514
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,700
 I just want him to confirm what you say because I do want to believe that it would be useful

515
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:27,700
 this panel to have him acknowledge anything you say that wouldn't add to that.

516
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:36,140
 One of the things that we have heard in previous days is the possibility that many of these

517
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:44,620
 UFO events are due to earthly craft, but in the case of Colonel Santa Maria, we can prove

518
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:49,540
 that this was not anything, any technology we see here on earth.

519
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:55,260
 In the military terminology, there was a wall of fire basically that he came up, that this

520
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,580
 object came up against.

521
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:02,180
 There's nothing on earth that could defend itself against that specifically in that time,

522
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:09,420
 not even up to today, not because it was able to only defend itself, but as the colonel

523
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:16,460
 stated, well you asked him what was the impact that it had on that, it actually, there was

524
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,460
 no impact.

525
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,100
 It absorbed all of these rounds.

526
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,700
 It actually absorbed it.

527
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,900
 That is absolutely impossible for any earth or any technology that we have here on earth

528
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,780
 to be able to absorb that type of barrage.

529
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:37,340
 If I could interrupt you for just a moment and say, do you agree with the two or three

530
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:42,060
 important points there that Dr. Troy just made?

531
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:53,580
 Yes, I do agree because over time we have talked about the possible situations and the

532
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,500
 different perspectives that exist.

533
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,720
 Obviously I fired, and there should have been some sort of impact, but there was nothing.

534
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,940
 There was no, the bullets didn't even explode.

535
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,900
 There was no explosion of the barrage of what I was firing, so it just absorbed it.

536
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:15,060
 Okay, thank you very much, and I'd love to continue with this, but I do need to ask another

537
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,020
 question here with just a minute on my time left.

538
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
 We have one minute left.

539
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,020
 That's right.

540
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,020
 That's what I said.

541
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:26,840
 I'd like to go over here to Mr., excuse me, Colonel Sanchez.

542
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:33,380
 Your system in Uruguay that apparently has been in existence for 33 years, you say, that

543
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:40,940
 it's a track, and keep track of anything that's cited, it's called, I can't remember the operation

544
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:49,180
 name of it, or the, excuse me, let me grab my notes, I'm so mesmerized by the previous

545
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:59,940
 testimony, but the system you have where you outline the five or six steps to even get

546
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:08,660
 qualified to be seriously looked at, and then tracked as far as any UFO sightings that your

547
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:16,100
 organization in Uruguay keeps track of, do you have records of things similar to what

548
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:23,700
 we've just been talking about with Colonel Santa Maria, and I'm not sure if Peru and

549
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:30,100
 Europe, they do have the same language, don't they, or you obviously heard everything anyway,

550
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,740
 but through these translations, so I'd like to know anything that might be in that, that

551
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:39,200
 kind of talks about this sort of thing, and since I'll be out of time, if you keep your

552
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:54,100
 answer somewhat short, but. Yes, we for the last 33 years have had an Air Force commission

553
00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:02,620
 that also is accountable to the public on all issues dealing with UFOs. This commission

554
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:09,460
 also has military and civilian members, and also does have archives of 1300 cases that

555
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:16,620
 had been investigated, 3% of which, there are 39 or 40 cases now that have not been

556
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:25,380
 solved because of the level of bizarreness that they presented, and Uruguay has scientifically

557
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,540
 addressed the UFO issue and does not rule out the extraterrestrial element, but for

558
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,500
 this we do need scientific evidence. We do have cases, such as that which Colonel Santa

559
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:48,060
 Maria mentioned, and how fighter jets were scrambled to chase these objects, and how

560
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:53,260
 there was a chase, an in-air chase, and following glowing objects, and sometimes they would

561
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:59,620
 get close to, and how these objects would get close to air bases throughout Latin America.

562
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:10,700
 Thank you. A wise course, by the way. Thank you. Trust but verify. Senator. Thank you.

563
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:19,100
 I'd like to start with our colleague from Brazil. Yes, sir. You mentioned that the government

564
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:28,900
 responded from an investigatory point of view to the apparent violent attacks that took

565
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:35,540
 place in the Amazon area, killing people. Now, that's the first, at least that I am

566
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:45,300
 aware of anywhere in the world, where an aggressive attack resulting in loss of life that was

567
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:52,220
 the product of a flying saucer, extraterrestrial effort. Could you elaborate a little bit more

568
00:43:52,220 --> 00:44:00,180
 specifically on the investigation that was made over the death of these people? Yes.

569
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:08,340
 We don't know for what reason that took place, but that happened. During two or three years,

570
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:19,460
 like 1976, '77, '78, we had casualties, at least four casualties, and we have a record

571
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:27,420
 of 400 people attacked. Not only people, but also animals were attacked by these beams

572
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:34,020
 of light that would come from these balls, these spaceships. Sometimes they were referred

573
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:44,860
 to like a can with a windshield and two persons, two human-like creatures inside of it operating

574
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:52,580
 that spaceship. This has been described in detail by lots of people who live in the area

575
00:44:52,580 --> 00:45:02,500
 of Salgado, especially in the island of Colares, which is 60 or 70 miles from the city of Belém.

576
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:08,780
 This has also been reported by the military. Now, the very interesting thing about it is

577
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:15,780
 that when the military decided to camp there and to conduct their investigations, the attacks

578
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:26,340
 stopped. Very rare attacks took place in other areas, but not where the military were. Also,

579
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:31,740
 when the military decided to change their camping from one point of the island to another

580
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:41,500
 point of the island, the objects that would be hovering, that previous point where the

581
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:49,540
 operations were taking place, would move to the other area, like in the own words of the

582
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:55,580
 commander of the Operation Saucer, Jorge Yolanda, like if these intelligences knew what the

583
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:07,500
 military were doing in that area. That's very amazing. These are only 440 pages of a total

584
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:14,820
 of 2,000 pages that were produced as a result of the Operation Saucer. I would like to address

585
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:21,260
 this to you. I would like that you have time to examine this because this contained very

586
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:30,540
 hard information collected in a military fashion by military men on duty investigating UFOs

587
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:36,980
 in a confidential, not top secret, but confidential, sometimes reserved operation by the Brazilian

588
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,780
 Air Force and the Amazon.

589
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:47,580
 Has the military who have been in charge of this investigation, have they been transparent

590
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,900
 with the public in Brazil?

591
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:57,860
 As I told before, on that day, we are under military dictatorship, so there wasn't much

592
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,860
 transparency.

593
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,140
 Presently, after the dictatorship left?

594
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:07,140
 Yes. The gentleman that conducted the Operation Saucer, the commander of it, was a captain

595
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:13,260
 at that time, and he retired as a coronel. And 20 years after the Operation Saucer was

596
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:20,900
 shut down, this man called me and invited me to his place, to his house in Rio de Janeiro

597
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:26,980
 where he was living. And I spent two days with him, interviewing him extensively where

598
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:32,500
 he gave me full details of everything that happened during those four months. And he

599
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:41,860
 also described me how he and his men had a close encounter with the creatures that came

600
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:50,620
 in those objects. And that actually, this main encounter with an alien creature that

601
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:58,660
 took place in mid-December, 1977, was what caused the Operation Saucer to be shut down.

602
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:05,620
 And in my reading of it is because the Brazilian military wouldn't know what to do if this

603
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:14,620
 context, open context among military and extraterrestrial start being regular in the Amazon, what we

604
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:21,840
 can do now. So then the Operation Saucer was shut down. But just to add a few more pieces

605
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:32,100
 of information that it was only asked to say shut down to make pretend, because the Operation

606
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:40,220
 Saucer then became, in a second level, much more secret and was conducted for several

607
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:47,420
 more months under military, US military command in Brazilian territory.

608
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:54,740
 Well, I think you partially answered the next question was that was there a US presence

609
00:48:54,740 --> 00:49:01,540
 interfacing with your military in the investigation of these UFOs?

610
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,540
 Yes, sir.

611
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,100
 You have documentary evidence of that?

612
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,940
 I have the reports given to me by the commander of the Operation Saucer that he interacted

613
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:21,180
 many, many times with Brazilian intelligence agents members and US intelligence.

614
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,780
 Which would be the CIA.

615
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:29,860
 That will be the CIA and also military. They will be all over the Amazon looking for the

616
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:37,180
 same kind of information that we are looking for, about who are those intelligences that

617
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,780
 pilot those machines.

618
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:44,700
 Do you not find that somewhat bizarre that our government now officially says that there's

619
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:50,420
 no investigation that we were involved with, no documentation?

620
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,220
 I would say that is more than bizarre.

621
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,420
 Okay. Let me move on to my question.

622
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:03,620
 Even our government is admitting in the farthest end that there has been official investigation.

623
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:10,020
 Now we started in Brazil in 2004 a movement, a campaign called UFOs Freedom of Information

624
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:15,980
 Now to request to the government to open its files and we have succeeded.

625
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:23,140
 It's the only model like this in this planet where the society have asked its government

626
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:29,980
 to come clear about it and it came. At least partially because we have got from 2008 to

627
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:42,060
 2010 not only 4,500 pages of UFO document but also like 300 to 400 pictures of UFOs.

628
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:47,580
 This is all given to the society. This has all been put in the National Archives. Anybody

629
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:51,540
 can go to the National Archives in Brasilia or in Rio and see this.

630
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,540
 Was there panic in the streets when this was revealed?

631
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,260
 Not at all. Not for a single minute.

632
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,860
 So the people were mature enough to accept this knowledge?

633
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,860
 Absolutely.

634
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:08,420
 Let me go to my friend from Chile. Do you have any knowledge of American military presence

635
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:15,620
 or intelligence presence interfacing with the officials in Chile gathering information

636
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,940
 on UFOs?

637
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,800
 Not really except if you look historically some of the FOIA documents released by the

638
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:33,060
 CIA. Usually it was the Defense Attaché Office that if it was a very important case they

639
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:42,540
 would send those guys to collect the information. Historically in some of the release files

640
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:49,740
 there are occasionally some documents about Chile but not recently. I have not seen it.

641
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:56,060
 Like I said General Bermudez the head of the committee actually wanted to have a relationship

642
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,700
 but he wanted to be open and official.

643
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,700
 We didn't want that.

644
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:12,540
 That says a lot. With respect and you've drafted or you've worked with Danny Sheehan in drafting

645
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:19,180
 a resolution that can come from this body trying to refer this matter to the General

646
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,180
 Assembly of the United States.

647
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:26,100
 Yeah because it has to be a mechanism like I said on the first day in this hearing.

648
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:31,900
 Could you circulate that document as soon as possible to the members so we can begin

649
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,380
 to digest it?

650
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:38,140
 Okay although we have really not this is a kind of thing that we need to discuss.

651
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:43,540
 I realize it's a draft. We're all very sophisticated in dealing with drafts and first writings

652
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:47,100
 but we can massage something as long as we have something in our hands.

653
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,100
 Okay.

654
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:58,180
 Now to my colleague from Uruguay. Did I understand you correctly that your system of investigation

655
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:03,900
 has been transparent and open to the public from the very beginning? Did I understand

656
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,900
 that properly?

657
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:19,100
 Yes, that's correct. In fact Uruguay has published through this commission a book that I brought

658
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,300
 here to show you with more than 20 cases of Uruguay, official cases written by the first

659
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:28,780
 president of this group, Colonel Eduardo Aguirre, who wrote this book 11 years ago. It was published

660
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:39,580
 publicly so that the public could follow all of the ufological activity in Uruguay. There

661
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:45,540
 are also press conferences and the information is even taken to the schools to talk to them

662
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:51,980
 about this and even educate them on this issue. This commission is made up by both civil and

663
00:53:51,980 --> 00:54:06,940
 military members. It has a work methodology that was adopted in 1979 and this methodology

664
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,220
 was also shared with China.

665
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:14,980
 You just said that this was brought to the schools so it could be educated to the young

666
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:18,580
 people of your country. Is that correct?

667
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:25,700
 Yes, that's correct. The UFO issue is something that everybody likes to hear about, especially

668
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:34,540
 young people, at least in Uruguay. And they request that the Air Force go and give talks

669
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:49,220
 to the kids, and they go to many different places.

670
00:54:49,220 --> 00:55:08,180
 When the U.S. helicopter retrieves the materials from the downed UFO aircraft, was there no

671
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:13,980
 reaction to a violation of your sovereignty by the United States of America or do you

672
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:20,460
 just accept these kind of violations as a matter of course?

673
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:28,020
 Actually, this information, well we just recently learned about this based on the disclosure

674
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:36,380
 project that Stephen Greer carried out based on the testimony that a military official,

675
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:44,300
 Richard Winga, provided. This was circulated in the UFO groups in Peru. It never made it

676
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:52,360
 to the press in Peru. And the press is the same here as it is in Peru. They don't really

677
00:55:52,360 --> 00:56:01,060
 talk about it. And so the media generally try to cover up any type of thing like this.

678
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:06,500
 So the government doesn't really give importance to this, and they say, well we're just going

679
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,060
 to keep it in the corner here, and they're just going to say that there wasn't a real

680
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,060
 invasion of sovereignty.

681
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:22,220
 You should take a page from the Uruguayan approach to the issue. Colonel Santa Maria,

682
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:27,140
 who gave the order to shoot? Was that your own initiative or did it come from higher

683
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:34,140
 headquarters as you were selected and taking off?

684
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:41,940
 The order was to intercept and destroy. Because this is something that could invade our airspace.

685
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:49,300
 That's right. That answers my question. Thank you. I think my time is expired, so I can't

686
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,620
 get to Argentina. Thank you.

687
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:58,980
 Thank you very much. And with that, we will go to Representative Bartlett.

688
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:05,580
 Thank you very much. First, I want to apologize for my tardiness. This is National Day of

689
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:11,300
 Prayer in the United States. And for a long time, I had been scheduled to be the main

690
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:18,500
 speaker at a countywide National Day of Prayer breakfast this morning. And so I fulfilled

691
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:23,140
 that obligation and came here so soon as I could. We have your testimony then. Thank

692
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,620
 you all very, very much.

693
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:35,340
 While our military and our government is saying that there's no such thing as a possibility

694
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:44,700
 of a UFO coming from another world, they of course admit that there are UFOs. UFO simply

695
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,860
 means unidentified flying object. And the Air Force says that in their Project Blue

696
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:55,940
 Book there were 701 of them that they couldn't wish away some way or another. So they do

697
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:01,220
 admit they're unidentified flying objects. They simply are denying categorically, I think,

698
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:06,700
 that they could be of extraterrestrial origin. But while they seem to poo-poo the whole thing

699
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:16,820
 here and relegate it to the ha-ha corner, they apparently are aggressive in participating

700
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:22,420
 in investigations of USO sightings in South America. And I'd just like to start here

701
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:26,980
 with Mr. Gavard and go down the table and have you tell each of us briefly, is this

702
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,420
 true in your country and to what extent?

703
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:36,500
 Yes, it is. Actually, I'd like to take this opportunity to speak about crashes. It has

704
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:43,060
 been said here in this table and during the preceding years and days that crashes of UFOs

705
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:50,700
 have happened, most of them in old days. But there is at least one recent crash and it

706
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:59,820
 took place in Brazil in 1996. It is called the Virginia case in which an alien spacecraft

707
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:07,420
 crashed and at least two creatures were captured and offered no resistance to its capture.

708
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:15,620
 But they died right after they were captured. And this procedure were taken of rescuing

709
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:22,180
 the debris of the UFO and capturing the creatures were taken both by the fire department of

710
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:31,420
 the city of Virginia with the army personnel of a nearby headquarter. And in the next day,

711
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:39,340
 the following day of the capture, we already knew that US intelligence and US military

712
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:47,820
 as well as US doctors were sent by the US consulate in Sao Paulo to the city of Virginia

713
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:55,500
 to follow the procedures. The doctors were sent, medical doctors from United States,

714
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:05,380
 to follow what was being done about the creatures because they died and nobody could explain

715
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:13,260
 how were their morphology, how they function. And we know for a fact because this is a very

716
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:21,460
 well-documented case that has been investigated by at least 70 UFO researchers, including

717
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:28,220
 first UFO researchers from United States as Dr. Roger Lear, Dr. James Hurtuk, and the

718
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:33,140
 deceased Dr. John Mack from Harvard University. They have been to Brazil, they confirmed what

719
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:38,540
 the UFO researchers from Brazil discovered. And we know for a fact that at least one of

720
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:47,380
 those two creatures were taken to United States by US military. And it was taken in one of

721
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:53,740
 the Buffalo airplanes to serve the US embassies and consulates in South America. When it came

722
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:59,140
 back to United States, it brought back to here one of the creatures and part of the

723
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:07,180
 object that were rescued, that were retrieved by the Brazilian military.

724
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:15,060
 Yes. Well, in Chile, I don't have really much information about the other than what

725
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:20,620
 I said earlier, that there were some documents from the CIA, but they tend to be old. But

726
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:26,900
 I do want to bring up a case that was mentioned by my colleague, Johnetti, which happened

727
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:32,300
 in Bolivia. And we don't have anybody from Bolivia here, so I'll speak briefly about

728
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:39,180
 that case because I'm familiar with. And it's a crash too that took place in Tarija, which

729
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:46,780
 is on the border of Bolivia and Argentina in May of 1978. In this case, we do have some

730
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:52,340
 documents, not Majestic 12 type documents, which are controversial, but these are officially

731
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:57,860
 released documents under the Freedom of Information Act, including a telex from Secretary of State

732
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:05,220
 Cyrus Vance at the time. And also Air Force officers from the Defense Attaché Office

733
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:13,260
 under a project that was called Project Moon Dust, which is well established that existed,

734
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:18,580
 which was for the recovery of space objects. I mean, that's how they started. As soon as

735
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:24,860
 the space age took off in 1957, then the Air Force created this project, Moon Dust, for

736
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:31,980
 the recovery of space debris. But according to one document, they list space debris, and

737
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,380
 in those days only two countries had space projects. That was the United States and the

738
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:41,900
 Soviet Union. And then it says unidentified flying objects in the same document. So when

739
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:49,260
 this incident happened, two officers from the Defense Attaché Office, which were stationed

740
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:55,480
 in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, somehow showed up in this remote area. And unfortunately

741
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:01,340
 for them, as they were coming in the airport, they were photographed by a local reporter.

742
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:06,180
 And the picture, you can see them, they're trying to hide their faces, but there they

743
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:10,660
 were. They were photographed, and the picture was published in the press. So the cover story

744
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:15,580
 is that they were on vacation. But that's not a type of city you go on vacation, number

745
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:21,780
 one. They were not with their wives. So obviously that was a cover story and a pretty bad one.

746
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:28,980
 Nevertheless, this was in a very remote area. We only have probably a very partial file

747
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:34,380
 from the US. There's only a few documents. I'm sure there's plenty more. Where the case

748
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:40,740
 gets a little murky is as to whether something was really retrieved and taken back to the

749
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:46,060
 US, or it may still be there, because it was in an extremely remote area, and there had

750
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:53,940
 been like a landslide on a mountain. There was an expedition initially by the army, by

751
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:58,420
 the Bolivian army, under a lieutenant, and they finally got to the area, but they didn't

752
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:04,540
 have the equipment and the facilities to do something. And there are some rumors that

753
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:09,420
 something was retrieved and taken to the United States, but then according to an American

754
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:14,780
 reporter who did investigate this case, whose name was Bob Pratt, he's now deceased, he

755
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:20,980
 thinks that they never did retrieve, because it was such a remote area, so that object

756
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:26,700
 might still be there. But again, it shows that there is an interest on the part of the

757
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:35,460
 United States, and we have uncovered some documents, but there's probably much more.

758
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,420
 Thank you. Colonel Sanchez.

759
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:47,340
 In the Uruguayan case, as regards to UFO investigation, there is no official exchange with the United

760
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,900
 States. The only exchanges that we have had with the United States have been the recovery

761
01:04:52,900 --> 01:05:02,900
 in 2011 of a star engine, Delta II, which fell over our airspace. I personally went

762
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:10,140
 to recover that object. But as regards to UFO issues, we have no exchange agreement

763
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:14,900
 with them, nor have we carried out any official exchange with them.

764
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:23,340
 Dr. Troy. In the case of my country, I understand that

765
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:28,300
 this takes place at two levels. The public level, in which the Air Force Office is in

766
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:33,340
 charge of this, and through the public relations. But I understand that at another level, there

767
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,580
 is an official exchange of information. And this is a constant exchange of information

768
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:41,780
 we can see, because afterwards, we can see the information does make it to the United

769
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:49,300
 States when there are UFO crashes. For example, in the case that we mentioned before, the

770
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:54,860
 San Mato de Huancho in 1980, unfortunately, there are no official documents. Everything

771
01:05:54,860 --> 01:06:01,220
 is at a secret level, but we have received many testimonies on exchange of information.

772
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:12,860
 President Maria. Comments, please, on any participation of

773
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:18,380
 our either intelligence or military, any other part of our government, in investigations

774
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:31,900
 of UFOs in your country. I'm not aware of any official U.S. involvement

775
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,340
 on the UFO issue, but we do know that in the intelligence exchange, there is an exchange

776
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:41,200
 of information between the intelligence agencies. Anytime there's a new event, there is an exchange

777
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,180
 of information to update the intelligence communities on these issues.

778
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:49,940
 Mr. Gimini. Yes, regarding as I explained to the senator,

779
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:56,700
 in matter of ufology on research, I'm not aware of any documentation exchange between

780
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:03,740
 Argentina and United States. But regarding to other agencies, as NASA, well, NASA has

781
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:08,460
 in several cases of Argentina is a place where there's a lot of space junk. There's a lot

782
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:17,620
 of debris satellites coming from international, also other countries. And I researched many

783
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:26,540
 cases where many debris is coming, but different kind of procedures.

784
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:36,220
 And in the case of NASA, yes, they asked for particular cases if they were part of American

785
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:44,000
 missions. And there was a few cases of retrieval, yes. But we were talking about only space

786
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,580
 debris. Oh, thank you. It's very interesting that

787
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:51,860
 there's apparently a different attitude on their part if it's outside this country. The

788
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:56,340
 inner country is total denial. But if they really believe that, then they wouldn't be

789
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:01,540
 participating in these investigations in South America.

790
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:06,740
 Mr. Gimini, you mentioned that Operation Saucer was shut down. Is that simply because it then

791
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:12,020
 went underground, then went secret? They continued the investigation, but secret now?

792
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:17,460
 The main reason why the Operation Saucer was shut down was because there was an actual

793
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:23,880
 contact among the military, William Jolanda, the captain that was commanding the Operation

794
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:29,620
 Saucer, and an extraterrestrial creature. It took place on mid-December 1977. And as

795
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:35,540
 part of his duties, the commander of the Operation Saucer has to go back to his commander, a

796
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:40,540
 brigadier in the city of Belen, and report weekly what was going on during the Operation

797
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:47,100
 Saucer. And when he did that that week, then when he informed to his superior that he had

798
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:54,260
 an actual encounter with a creature, two arms, two legs, a body, a head, with a helmet that

799
01:08:54,260 --> 01:09:02,700
 came from a UFO, 300 feet long, that almost landed close to the Guajará-Mirim River.

800
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:09,060
 When we reported that to the brigadier, Protasso de Oliveira, his commander, then William Jolanda

801
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:15,820
 was given order to shut down Operation Saucer and return all material and bring all his

802
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:22,140
 men from the jungle to the city and give it all the material, all the information.

803
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:28,740
 Then we realized, we knew, I've been seeking information about it for quite 20, 20-some

804
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:35,020
 years. I have gathered lots of information about it in my, in my pursuit for the details

805
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:42,180
 of this, that the Operation Saucer changed its name, changed its personnel. All the three

806
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:50,100
 dozen men that were commanded by William Jolanda were taken off the scene, and the new personnel

807
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:58,220
 took the operation under a different name and under U.S. military command from several

808
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:00,780
 months after December 1977.

809
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:07,060
 Oh, thank you. One quick question to Colonel Santa Maria. What would be the-

810
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,980
 You have less than one minute.

811
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:14,740
 Less than one minute. I saw that. Thank you. I saw that. What would be the arguments for

812
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:22,460
 and against the suggestion that what you were dealing with was kind of like a giant hologram

813
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:30,300
 rather than something physical? Your bullets had no effect on it. I'm just asking, you

814
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:35,900
 know, if that was the argument, that could it have been a kind of a giant hologram, what

815
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:39,100
 would be the arguments for that? What would be the arguments against that?

816
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:51,420
 Well, it would be difficult for it to be a hologram because I saw it from different angles,

817
01:10:51,420 --> 01:11:00,740
 and when it moved, a hologram could change, it could change shape, but the colors were

818
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:06,220
 very solid. It was a real object. This was not a hologram.

819
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:13,540
 It was an object that we can't understand if, in fact, there was no effect of bullets

820
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:20,380
 on it. I'm just curious. We're dealing with a phenomenon here that we cannot explain in

821
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:26,880
 terms of our physics and so forth here. I'm just wondering what the various options are.

822
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,980
 Thank you all very much. Or if we can have a second round to answer additional questions.

823
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:37,860
 We will probably have a very short round. Okay, thank you. Yes. One question per person,

824
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:43,540
 however. Thank you very much for being here today. Great testimony.

825
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:50,980
 Thank you. I would like to hear from each one of you.

826
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:59,620
 What's the attitude here? It is, well, if you believe in unidentified fine objects or

827
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:08,920
 you believe that there's spacecraft that comes in, there's been such a damper by both the

828
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:16,860
 press and our government about believing this. I mean, you're sort of made fun of if you

829
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:23,860
 look at this and say, "Yes, this is real." What's the attitude of both the people and

830
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:30,900
 your press? We'll start with Mr. Jordan. Thank you. This is definitely not a matter

831
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:38,700
 of belief. There is a lot of data that has been produced by civilian UFO researchers,

832
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:45,020
 military UFO researchers, very few but very dedicated scientists for the last 60 years

833
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:53,940
 to confirm without any question at all that we are being visited by several species of

834
01:12:53,940 --> 01:13:01,540
 more advanced, at least technologically, more advanced civilization that come here.

835
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:09,060
 And there's objects that they design, they construct like a Boeing does. It's Boeing.

836
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,780
 It's airplanes here. They must have something like that in their planets. And they visit

837
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:22,420
 other planets in the universe. It is as simple as thinking what we are doing presently. We

838
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:30,020
 are at this very moment on Mars, on moon, taking photo of satellites, of Uranus, of

839
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:36,260
 the rings of Jupiter, of whatever. We are exploring our backyard. The difference is

840
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:45,020
 that our technology presently only allows us to explore this backyard. But if we're

841
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:54,580
 doing this now in 2013, in 20 years, in 30 years, in 50 years perhaps, we will be able

842
01:13:54,580 --> 01:14:03,980
 to do interplanetary trips with crews inside our spaceships safely, effectively, go and

843
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:11,980
 come back. So if we can do this in the near future, and we're working on that definitely,

844
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:18,820
 this advanced civilization that started the evolutionary process much before us, they

845
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:24,140
 are doing the same. And they may have been doing the same for quite some time, perhaps

846
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:29,820
 hundreds of years, thousands of years. We don't know. The universe is so full of life.

847
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:36,020
 And the variety of this life in the formats and the levels of evolutionary process, it's

848
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:42,420
 just unthinkable for us at this point. But we are grasping the surface of this. We are

849
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:49,060
 doing history here. We are doing what we are supposed to do, to question and to whatever

850
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:55,540
 we find out, take to the society, make the society know that we are being visited. Because

851
01:14:55,540 --> 01:15:01,980
 we may very well, at any point, receive their visitation in an open and frank way. And the

852
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:10,620
 world has to be prepared for that. It's not out of question that one day we will change,

853
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:19,180
 exchange with them, we'll engage, we'll live with other societies from other planets.

854
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:23,060
 It's just a matter of time. Thank you.

855
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:28,380
 Antonio? Yes. You're asking about the social attitude

856
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:35,820
 of the public and the press in Latin America. I would say, in general, it is much more open

857
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:43,700
 than in the United States. Whenever there is an important UFO case, it gets covered

858
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:49,620
 in mainstream newspapers. So it would be like here being covered by the Washington Post,

859
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:54,700
 by the New York Times, but seriously, or at least semi-seriously. There is some ridicule,

860
01:15:54,700 --> 01:16:02,900
 of course, but not as bad as the US. The scientific community, on the other hand, has been very

861
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:07,820
 conservative, generally speaking, in Latin America. I would say that there might be more

862
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:15,500
 scientists quietly doing research in the US than in Latin America. Although that is changing.

863
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:21,580
 Now that they see these official commissions, then that gives them some cover. If some general

864
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:26,220
 that is attached to the Civil Aviation Agency asks professors from the universities, then

865
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:30,380
 that gives them cover. But in the past, it was curious to see that the press and the

866
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:35,780
 general public and the governments were more open, but the scientific community was more

867
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:39,620
 closed. Interesting.

868
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:45,180
 They were just afraid, maybe, because the peer pressure is always bad. In one thing

869
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:50,580
 that General Ben Mudez told me, which I found it very interesting, is that he said the pilots,

870
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:59,460
 the airline pilots, were very cautious. Normally, because in the past, airline pilots, they

871
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:03,620
 never wanted to report UFOs publicly, because it may affect their career. They don't want

872
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:13,300
 to be known as the UFO nut. So he said they're trying to condition them that it's okay.

873
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:18,700
 After all, this committee is from the Civil Aviation, and these are official forms. But

874
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:25,500
 he said it's easier for them from the military pilots, because if their commander tells a

875
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:31,260
 military pilot, "Here's a report, you fill the form," then officers follow orders, right?

876
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:36,980
 But the airline pilots is still volunteer. But the fact that this agency is with the

877
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:41,420
 Civil Aviation, that is also changing. And of course, because they are with the Civil

878
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:48,620
 Aviation, that's their primary source of information. It usually comes from pilots who are, in the

879
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:54,340
 course of their flying, they're seeing something. They don't know if that is another air traffic

880
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:59,740
 or something else. So they will call the control tower, says, "Well, I see an object in that

881
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:05,020
 corner. Do you have any air traffic?" And then usually the control tower, well, in some cases

882
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:09,940
 they probably do, and then that's filed away, and it's not a UFO case. But in other cases,

883
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:14,420
 they don't. So then the control tower says, "No, we have no scheduled traffic there."

884
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:19,460
 And these communications are recorded and preserved. In the old days, probably they

885
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:24,460
 were erased after a while, but now they're preserved. And then there's official reporting

886
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:30,580
 forms that the committee gives them. But it is still up to airline pilots, that part is

887
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:34,980
 still volunteer, whether they want to fill the report or not. So they have to be conditioned.

888
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:40,580
 Right. But they're being conditioned by the government. So hopefully that will change.

889
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:49,460
 Colonel Sanchez? Well, I wanted to tell you that the Uruguayan

890
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:56,060
 Air Force does not rule out the hypothesis that these are extraterrestrials. This phenomenon

891
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:06,900
 is one that we've seen occur in Uruguayan airspace. It could be different probes, something

892
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:12,460
 else, but we need scientific evidence to prove it. That's why our commission works using

893
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:18,540
 scientific methodologies, but we do so through the Air Force. I believe that people's attitude

894
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:26,260
 and the media's attitude in Uruguay are very respectful, given the fact that for 33 years,

895
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:34,500
 the Air Force has been spearheading UFO investigations in Uruguay. And so I believe that the Uruguayan

896
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:42,460
 people have reliable and transparent official information and understand that. The situation

897
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:47,100
 in each country is different. In the case of Brazil, United States, these are massive

898
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:56,580
 countries with large tracts of land and very sophisticated defense systems. It's not the

899
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:08,140
 same in Uruguay. Uruguay doesn't develop weapons. We don't have special aeronautic or space

900
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:14,740
 research. So I think that's why there's greater acceptance. However, in the case of the United

901
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:21,700
 States, it's something that we all know. Defense is very important, and so they have to keep

902
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:29,460
 some secrets when it comes to sharing information. I've heard people mention over these days

903
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:38,660
 that these UFOs could be a new prototype of an unmanned aircraft, and that might make

904
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:44,660
 things difficult for the Department of Defense or especially for companies that build these,

905
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:52,220
 you know, Lockheed or Boeing. And that's why I believe that there are greater reservations,

906
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:58,060
 and I think that that's natural in terms of sharing information in terms of what's been

907
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:01,220
 flying around out there. That's at least my personal opinion.

908
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:14,540
 Thank you very much. Yes. Yes, you were talking about believing or not in UFOs. I support

909
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:18,940
 what our colleague from Brazil said. It's not a matter of belief. It's a matter of information.

910
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:23,220
 The information is out there, and over these five days we've been talking about it very

911
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:31,540
 openly. However, and I'm struck by how this is addressed in the United States. They underscore

912
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:40,540
 the fact that these civilizations are potentially aggressive, you know, the nuclear aspects

913
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:47,340
 of this. That's very interesting, because we don't look at it that way. It seems like

914
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:53,860
 there might be politically correct extraterrestrials, you know, because they might be offensive

915
01:21:53,860 --> 01:22:01,940
 in some way. But in Peru, when we hear about cases of encounters, we have very credible

916
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:08,660
 testimony of people who've had contact in many different cases. But it's always been

917
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:12,940
 with civilizations where there have been attempts made at engaging and having communication.

918
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:21,620
 If you look at the case of Santa Maria, where there was this "clash" and where all of the

919
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:26,820
 ammo was fired, you would expect a response from the others. But there was none. It seemed

920
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:32,820
 like it was like a cat and mouse game. And if they wanted to destroy it, they would,

921
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:35,900
 clearly with their technology, they would have been able to do that, and they haven't

922
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:42,780
 done it. So I think our approach is very different. It's not, we look at superior technology,

923
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:51,860
 not in military framework, but there are many visits that we are receiving. We have to look

924
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:58,340
 at it. Unfortunately, this is, we haven't been able to explain it scientifically yet.

925
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:03,380
 Thank you very much for your comments. Colonel?

926
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:12,700
 Yes. Just with respect for how the media treats us when there's a UFO case, I've worked

927
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:21,420
 with many airlines and crews. And I would say that starting in the 90s, pilots talk

928
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:27,780
 very openly about experiences that they've had, what they've seen, what they've heard.

929
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:39,020
 Because again, nobody makes fun of you or laughs at you. It's very normal now to talk

930
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:43,780
 about sightings, and that doesn't have any impact whatsoever on someone's career. And

931
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:50,260
 I'm very pleased that that's the case. In my experience with Argentina, I have three

932
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:58,180
 decades as a journalist, international, and I saw evolution. When I started, the media

933
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:04,720
 was more kind of, kind of, aseptic. It was hard to be interviewed. It was hard to kind

934
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:11,860
 of open this Pandora box of the subject. But I saw, all over the world, I've seen this

935
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:19,380
 changing. For example, with series of history channel, ancient aliens, or UFO hunters, the

936
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:28,380
 people is kind of totally more open. Today, for example, we are discovering planets similar

937
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:35,860
 to the Earth every day in the news. It's incredible how the astronomy and the exobiology is every

938
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:44,480
 day in your breakfast table in the newspaper. And that attitude also helped with the UFOs

939
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:51,540
 too. And for example, regarding with the pilots, it's interesting how the Latin American pilots

940
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:57,020
 are so open. Every time I travel, I go to the cockpit to talk with the pilots, and the

941
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:02,700
 pilots have experiences different to the United States, who the pilots are more shy. And I

942
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:08,340
 say, "What happened? We have only activities out of the border and not here?" It's interesting.

943
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:15,140
 See, and sometimes I feel ridiculous asking, but I always go also to the airline I travel

944
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:22,180
 in, United American Airlines. I say, "No, they don't talk too much." But I think it's

945
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:29,880
 a totally paradigm shift. It's a shift now in all levels of consciousness. And I think

946
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:35,260
 it's positive for the new generations. When I was growing up as a ufologist, yeah, my

947
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:41,980
 own family was kind of, "Oh, he liked these subjects." And they were not kind of accepting

948
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:50,180
 that, also the media. But I think it's totally a new hope for all of us.

949
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:56,860
 Thank you very much. I think we have time for one question from each panel member, if

950
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:00,180
 you have one.

951
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:08,340
 I have a question, and Dr. Choi was absolutely my straight man on this one. My question is

952
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:19,100
 to you, Colonel Santa Maria. There was a phenomena in the surprise that the object, the UFO did

953
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:27,100
 not, was not attacking back. And would you respond to that?

954
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:40,260
 Yes, it was a peaceful attitude. When I began to attack it, it evaded the fire. But never

955
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:48,820
 did I feel a threat that it was going to respond by attacking me. It's simply when my fuel,

956
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:58,100
 it was out, I just approached it and saw that it was an object that was unknown to me. I

957
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:05,180
 just wanted to see what it was. And I had to turn my back to return to the base. I thought,

958
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:10,900
 I don't know, maybe it's going to start chasing me now. But nothing of the sort happened.

959
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:21,820
 Thank you. Representative Kilpatrick. Thank you, Madam Chair. To Colonel Sanchez and Dr.

960
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:30,380
 Choi, what kind of scientific information do you seek that would verify the phenomena?

961
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:39,420
 Well, we, in theory, have no idea what it is we're actually investigating. So we use

962
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:54,420
 scientific methods to conduct our investigations. I can say that in 1993 we saw two luminous

963
01:27:54,420 --> 01:28:02,620
 spheres hovering over a field in the interior part of Uruguay, these luminous spheres that

964
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:12,460
 measured about 30 or 40 centimeters, no more than that. They left prints where scientifically

965
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:24,200
 through laboratory studies we saw a diminishment of phosphorus and zinc and magnesium. So samples

966
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:31,820
 were taken from where it had touched the soil. We saw there were eight different tracks there.

967
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:38,700
 And again, there was a reduction in phosphorus, zinc, and magnesium. We continue to use scientific

968
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:47,020
 methods to investigate in an attempt to see if this was reminiscent of any type of other

969
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:55,460
 interaction we've seen because of the color, the energy. But we don't know because we don't

970
01:28:55,460 --> 01:29:01,500
 have anything else to analyze. However, we continue to work on projects that have been

971
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:08,560
 underway for several years. We're working with Norway in an analysis of lights that

972
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:18,900
 have been seen hovering over Uruguay, over dams, in mountainous areas of rivers where

973
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:26,180
 there have been witnesses. We have photographs. We're trying to conduct a film and photographic

974
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:32,460
 analysis. And again, we're also working with Chile on this. We have a written agreement

975
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:39,100
 between the Uruguayan and the Chilean Air Force in the sharing of information and data.

976
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:47,780
 And Uruguay and Chile have a joint investigation on UFOs on Easter Island.

977
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:55,900
 In my particular case, when I was working with the Peruvian Air Force, I was cooperating

978
01:29:55,900 --> 01:30:04,460
 with them in their UFO office. The focus was on serious formal scientific investigations.

979
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:08,940
 We were given questionnaires that showed us how we were supposed to interview people.

980
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:16,220
 Then we had to cross this information with weather, data, et cetera. But this morning

981
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:22,600
 I was talking about the Chulucan incident. We saw these spheres of light that moved intelligently

982
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:31,440
 because they interacted with the people. When people tried to approach, they saw the spheres

983
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:38,980
 approaching then going back to where they were. And so it defied conventional science.

984
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:45,620
 And we sought explanations. We investigated for three years. And so the only way of understanding

985
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:54,220
 this phenomenon, again, is escaped traditional scientific cannons, that it was possible that

986
01:30:54,220 --> 01:31:02,340
 we had to look for new possibilities. And in a conference, I was saying that if it's

987
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:11,660
 73 million light years away, how do you continue to analyze it? And in 2010, there was a home

988
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:19,220
 in Lima, the capital of Peru, where there was a phenomenon where things started flying,

989
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:27,100
 floating around, things exploded. And there was a cell phone from the house owner. It

990
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:34,580
 was found in another house. And 25 people saw how that particular cell phone disappeared

991
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:41,020
 from one house and appeared in another house. And it wasn't that it flew from one place.

992
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:46,200
 It disappeared from point A and reappeared in point B. This is something like teleporting

993
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:55,140
 from science fiction. But it had witnesses. People call this paranormal phenomenon, which

994
01:31:55,140 --> 01:32:01,780
 is almost like a cuss word in sciences. But we have to look at ways to try to understand

995
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:02,780
 these phenomenon.

996
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:15,660
 Thank you. Representative Cook? Yes. Colonel Santamaria, I'd like to ask you, so that we

997
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:22,540
 can do due diligence on any possible other explanation or hologram explanation, for example,

998
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:30,140
 could you tell us what your Air Squad commander ordered you to do that day? How many people

999
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:35,900
 on the ground witnessed the globe, as you described it initially, as about 600 meters

1000
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:43,900
 above the earth, at about five kilometers away from the base, and particularly interested

1001
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:54,500
 in how long at speeds that you described as 1.6, up to 1.6 Mach speed, you did this, you

1002
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:58,700
 kept this globe in your sights.

1003
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:09,060
 When this balloon observed, there were 1,800 people who were in our morning formations.

1004
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:16,760
 And so they visually saw this globe. Radar had not detected it. And I was ready to fly.

1005
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:21,940
 And so I got the order that there's an object that's not responding to radio communications.

1006
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:29,100
 It's not on the radar. We thought it might be spy equipment, and it was in restricted

1007
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:36,860
 airspace for civilian flights. So I was given the order. This could be a spy object. And

1008
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:44,620
 so I was given the order to pursue it. And so if it did not move away, I was supposed

1009
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:52,340
 to engage it with fire. So 1,800 people witnessed it. But 400 people were in combat positions

1010
01:33:52,340 --> 01:34:00,540
 that if it started to attack, that they would intervene. So as I fired and it moved away

1011
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:09,140
 from the base, the other 400 kept their position. They remained on standby. And they saw that

1012
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:17,140
 it moved up in the air, and the object moved away. So I chased it. I think it was 1,800

1013
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:19,940
 people who saw this very clearly.

1014
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:25,020
 Thank you.

1015
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:27,380
 Senator.

1016
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:33,540
 I have no further questions. I just want to congratulate the panel coming forward, because

1017
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:40,860
 you've added a very unusual dimension to what we've been trying to prove. And that is that

1018
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:45,260
 our government has not been straightforward with the American people. So thank you for

1019
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:52,500
 helping us prove that case.

1020
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,380
 Representative Bartlett.

1021
01:34:56,380 --> 01:35:00,540
 Our chair has asked two-thirds of the question that I was anxious to ask. And the question

1022
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:05,100
 I was going to ask was, would you tell us, just go down the line and tell us, the attitudes

1023
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:11,020
 of your people, your press, and your military and government? And you've asked the question

1024
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:14,260
 about the people and the press.

1025
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:20,940
 So let me just ask the question. I want just a one-word answer from you. Where your military

1026
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:29,740
 and your government is on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is open and accepting and investigative,

1027
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:39,040
 and 10 is denial and ridicule. Our country is pretty close to 10. Tell us on that scale

1028
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,500
 where your countries are. Just a number.

1029
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:47,180
 Just a number. Being 0 total openness and 10 total ridicule.

1030
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:49,700
 Yeah, 1 or 0 total openness, right. Yeah.

1031
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:51,220
 I would say we are 3.

1032
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:52,700
 3? Pretty good.

1033
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,700
 2, 3.

1034
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:54,700
 OK.

1035
01:35:54,700 --> 01:36:02,940
 After this, the Iguachu forged the Iguachu letter and the recent meeting at the Ministry

1036
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:09,220
 of Defense in Brazil two weeks ago, only two weeks ago, maybe we can go an update, an upgrade

1037
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:11,660
 to 1.

1038
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:12,660
 That's fantastic.

1039
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:13,660
 I don't know.

1040
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:20,580
 Well, I think that we have to distinguish between the recognition that the UFO phenomenon

1041
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:26,380
 is real and the extraterrestrial hypothesis, because that's another step. So in the terms

1042
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:31,500
 of the acceptance of UFOs as a real phenomenon, I mean, we have this statement from General

1043
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:37,860
 Bermudez. Another important ufologist in Chile from the Army is Major Bravo, who was with

1044
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:44,900
 the aviation branch of the Army. That would be a 0, a 1. They totally recognize that the

1045
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:50,740
 UFO phenomenon is real. But the extraterrestrial hypothesis, that's another question, because

1046
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:55,780
 then you would have to have a body or a piece of metal or something that really could be

1047
01:36:55,780 --> 01:37:02,020
 proven. So there, I don't know, they admit the possibility, but there I would say maybe

1048
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:09,340
 a 6 or 7 as far as the ET part. But the UFO, total acceptance that it's a real phenomenon

1049
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:15,940
 and that it may pose possibly a threat to aviation. And that is something that governments

1050
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:21,540
 should take seriously. Absolutely. In South America, that is accepted today.

1051
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:33,300
 The vision of Uruguay from the point of view of the Uruguayan Air Force is people, I would

1052
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:49,960
 say, 0. Because Uruguay, through its Air Force and UFO Investigation Commission, even welcomed

1053
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:56,580
 the idea of extraterrestrials as a possibility. However, there are 40 cases, again, that we've

1054
01:37:56,580 --> 01:38:05,260
 been unable to resolve because of how odd they are. And you have civilian pilots, military

1055
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:15,860
 pilots that have chased these UFOs and have taken photographs. So I would say the openness

1056
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:24,300
 in Uruguay means that people have a good image of what the information we're providing is.

1057
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:28,460
 They believe it's reliable. And again, we use scientific methods because there's no

1058
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:36,420
 other way to do it from our point of view. And the groups that address UFOs, like spiritual

1059
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:44,660
 groups, that are also working in investigating this accept what we are proposing. And we've

1060
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:52,060
 even held a conference in 2012 where we invited all of the groups in Uruguay that do these

1061
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:56,580
 investigations. I think people were very happy, and I think there was acceptance. Thank you

1062
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,580
 very much.

1063
01:38:57,580 --> 01:39:07,940
 Thank you, Congressman. Before giving my response, I would like to clearly state that I profoundly

1064
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:13,500
 love my country, Peru, and I profoundly respect the armed forces of my country. In fact, they

1065
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:20,240
 gave me the opportunity to work with them, and I profoundly admire the American people

1066
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:25,960
 here as well. I want that to be very clear before I respond. What you're asking me is

1067
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:31,700
 very complex, because at the moment when the Peruvian government decided to open this investigation

1068
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:37,540
 office, they were admitting that there was a reality to this. They're not going to open

1069
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:45,300
 an office on unicorns and ghosts. No, that's not what we're doing here. But on the other

1070
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:50,460
 hand, this has been going on for 13 years, and we have seen minimal results. And when

1071
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:54,620
 I talk to the military personnel, they say that they have seen UFOs, but they can't come

1072
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:59,740
 out publicly and say because there is a policy that has not yet opened up. And so I would

1073
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:07,460
 say that that's why I couldn't give it a 10. But that would just be my response.

1074
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:13,700
 The Argentina government doesn't pronounce the extraterrestrial hypothesis open, but

1075
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:20,640
 in the history of our traditions, for example, in 1968, the president of Argentina, General

1076
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:27,100
 Longania, said, "I believe in the flying saucers." Yo creo en los platos voladores. That openness

1077
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:35,340
 always exists. In that case, it was the president of a nation. But the government is investigating

1078
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:43,340
 the UFOs with scientifically correctness in this moment. And in the future, maybe it will

1079
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:47,400
 be some pronunciation. That is it.

1080
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,300
 Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.

1081
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:50,300
 Thank you.

1082
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,300
 Thank you.

1083
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:58,500
 I want to thank our panel for being here today. This has been really interesting, and your

1084
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:04,940
 openness and what's happening in each of your countries has been, I think, a real eye-opener

1085
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:12,380
 for the rest of us. And with that, I'm going to conclude this hearing. We will be back

1086
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:13,380
 here at 1.45.

1087
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:13,380
 Meeting adjourned.
