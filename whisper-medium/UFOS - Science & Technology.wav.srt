1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,640
 If you're willing to do that, if you would stand, please, and repeat after me.

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:24,400
 I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, to this committee

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,440
 today.

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,760
 Thank you so much.

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:37,720
 First of all, I want to say to all of the people that have testified, you have done

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,920
 an incredible job.

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,240
 When I was asked to do this, I debated for a while, and it's a subject literally I know

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:59,800
 very little about, except what I read in the newspaper, most of it years ago.

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:09,280
 I was a skeptic when I came, and what I have found, and this has to do with the credibility

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:18,760
 of the people that have testified, I want you to know that, that I don't know what it

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:30,920
 is or how big it is, but I do believe that there are spaceships, whether they're friendly

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:40,800
 or whether they're enemies, that they have been enough sightings of a human creature.

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,400
 I don't know what it looks like.

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,640
 I appreciate what you have, the sacrifices you've made, and what you have done.

15
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,040
 For those of you here testifying for family members, or this is the first time that you've

16
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,520
 talked in public about this issue, you are to be commended.

17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,400
 I know it has to be a difficult thing, and it's easy for me, because I just got to sit

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,280
 here and listen to all of you.

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,640
 I just appreciate all of you that have been here and what you have done, and it was a

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,600
 privilege to sit and listen to your testimony.

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
 Thank you very much.

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 [Applause]

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,960
 Thank you, Representative Hooley.

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,920
 We'll now start with our witnesses, and I think we're allowing ten minutes each.

25
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
 That's great.

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,720
 If I could ask Dr. Wood, would you begin?

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
 Thank you.

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,960
 It's an honor to be included as a witness.

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,560
 In 1966, I had been working about 13 years for one company, and was doing well as a young

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,720
 engineering executive at Douglas Aircraft.

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,160
 That was the year the Air Force decided to have a symposium dedicated to important developments

32
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,840
 in space ten years hence, and my boss, Ray Hallett, had been selected to speak for our

33
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,440
 missiles and space part of the company on how to better to get things to orbit and back.

34
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,840
 He asked, what do you think we should talk about?

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,960
 I said, partly as a jest, why don't we just tell him how the alleged UFOs do it?

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,680
 He actually liked the idea and asked me to work on it.

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,440
 That was when I read my first UFO book, actually one by Don Menzel, the science arch skeptic,

38
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,800
 and I saw clearly that he was ignoring the reported data.

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,840
 I immediately read a dozen books on the subjects.

40
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,760
 A year later, Douglas had been bought by McDonnell, and we were now McDonnell Douglas, and had

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,400
 just won the Air Force satellite program called Manned Orbiting Laboratory.

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,440
 My regular job was to manage our company research and development projects funds so that we

43
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,600
 would win small technology contracts.

44
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,480
 One day, after I reported to a couple of VPs on how we were doing, one of them asked me

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,800
 personally if I was doing anything interesting outside my job.

46
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,840
 I said, well, you're not going to believe this, but I've read about 50 books on UFOs.

47
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,760
 The amazing conclusion I've come to is that they are very real extraterrestrial craft.

48
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,220
 The only thing that's uncertain is whether we find out how they work before or after

49
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,100
 our competitor Lockheed.

50
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,460
 After a moment of silence, one of them said, how much would it cost to take a look at that

51
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,800
 question?

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,520
 Therefore, we started a little project, kept quite low key, to study the question of how

53
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,240
 they work.

54
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,200
 Everyone who worked on this project knew that when the project was over, each would go back

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,400
 to his other job or be laid off.

56
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,160
 This was when we needed to find someone to study the sightings and reports in detail

57
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,820
 to see if we could get clues as to how they worked, and we hired Stan Friedman.

58
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,660
 We should have a picture of Stan Friedman up there right now as he looked in 1968.

59
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,000
 We did a lot of interesting projects such as measure the effects of a huge magnetic

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,960
 field on the speed of light.

61
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
 There was none.

62
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,560
 Interview an abductee, tried to invent a physics that would permit travel faster than the speed

63
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,340
 of light, developed an instrumented van to observe craft sightings anywhere, anytime,

64
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,320
 and spun magnets in space to try to change their weight.

65
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,100
 It didn't change.

66
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,360
 I also became friends with James E. McDonald, a physicist who was making a lot of noise

67
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,560
 and giving lectures about the details of highly credible sightings.

68
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,200
 Jim McDonald was very pushy to have my group get more exposure.

69
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,160
 He urged me to visit the Air Force UFO Condon Committee in 1967 before their report was

70
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,480
 complete and talked someone into inviting me to testify at a House Science and Astronautics

71
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,160
 Committee symposium on unidentified flying objects.

72
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,600
 I asked my management about this, and they said, "Do what you want, but good things

73
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,540
 rarely happen to people who testify to Congress."

74
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,880
 I decided not to testify, largely since I did not have any breakthroughs to even hint

75
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,840
 at, and if I did, they would have been the property of McDonnell Douglas.

76
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,080
 Then the military orbiting program was canceled in 1969.

77
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
 Dozens of people were being laid off.

78
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,360
 We were not making fantastic progress in our project, and I was assigned in 1970 to learn

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,680
 everything I could about radar and ballistic missile defense.

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,680
 We canceled the UFO project and moved on.

81
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:48,000
 This project's history was written up in both the International UFO Reporter in 1993, detailing

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,480
 the results of my visit to the Condon Committee and the MUFON Journal in 2008, elaborating

83
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,400
 on the details of who did what on this project and what we concluded.

84
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,680
 I followed the topic of ufology from 1970 to my retirement in 1993 as an avocation,

85
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,160
 but remained actively absorbing results and reports from MUFON, the Center for UFO Studies,

86
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,920
 and subscribed to the Flying Saucer Review, which came in a brown paper envelope, so you

87
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,040
 wouldn't know the subject, published in Britain.

88
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,140
 The consistency of alien reports occurring psychically caused me to be aware of other

89
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,840
 anomalous literature, and I had the pleasure of meeting Dean Bob John of Princeton University,

90
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,720
 who was initiating a consciousness research project.

91
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,920
 At the same time, my knowledge of radar put me in a position to manage a classified program

92
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,120
 with top-secret access to various subjects.

93
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,200
 I had read an article by Dr. Hal Putoff, currently then at Stanford Research Institute, reporting

94
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,960
 on some amazing results in remote viewing.

95
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:04,360
 We used our CIA contacts to work out a test project on coordinate remote viewing, where

96
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:13,040
 the subject is allegedly able to observe and describe what is at a specific Earth coordinate.

97
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,640
 This sensitive remote viewing project wound up being funded by James S. MacDonald, CEO

98
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,080
 of MacDonald Douglas, who was subsequently told by his lawyers that he should not have

99
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,280
 used foundation money to accomplish work in his profit-making firm.

100
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,440
 The results of one test of six targets were interesting but not spectacular.

101
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,400
 We speculated that the viewer might have gone to a coordinate in time when the most emotional

102
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,280
 events were happening at that location.

103
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,920
 This project also provided access to anything to do with ballistic missile defense, and

104
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,240
 I used a nice classified library at another facility to see what there was on the defense

105
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
 against UFOs.

106
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,360
 There were quite a few intriguing reports available, such as a classified version of

107
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,760
 the Iranian Air Force F-4 Phantom jet pilot attempting to fire a missile at a UFO only

108
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,280
 to have his controls shut down as soon as he thought about doing it.

109
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,640
 Even after I had borrowed and read quite a few of these anomalous reports, the whole

110
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,960
 library system was changed so that it was no longer clear where to look for reports.

111
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,120
 I also stayed aware of anomalies in science in general, and when the so-called cold fusion

112
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,200
 results of Pond's Fleischman were announced in 1989, I was aware that our company attempted

113
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,760
 a quick covert test to try to replicate the results.

114
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,360
 I was told we were not successful, but by then I was working on advanced technology

115
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,080
 for NASA International Space Station and not involved in any proprietary activity.

116
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:56,440
 After retirement in 1993, my focus on UFOs became the authentication of leaked documents

117
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,440
 as described on Wednesday.

118
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,440
 If these documents are valid, they are consistent in telling the story of exposure to the alien

119
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,240
 technology, attempts to understand it, and many specific tales of successfully understanding

120
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,280
 the principles and building devices that have become the technology breakthroughs we all

121
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,520
 enjoy today.

122
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,740
 There is a case to be made that the three crash recoveries of Missouri in April 1941

123
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:32,080
 and LA in February 1942, 1,430 rounds of ammunition during the famous LA air raid, resulted in

124
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,640
 a specific contract to study how germanium and silicon might be used in the preparation

125
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,120
 of semiconductors.

126
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,760
 Those individuals receiving reports and samples included Edward Condon at Westinghouse, Bell

127
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,800
 Laboratories, Hans Bethe of MIT Radiation Laboratory, and Shockley of Bell Telephone

128
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,840
 Laboratories in 1945, who was given credit for inventing the transistor in 1947.

129
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,700
 These leaked documents taken as a whole visualize and speculate on the impact of alien technology

130
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,640
 on our society in a diverse array of fields of science and technology.

131
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,160
 And doctor, you've got about one minute left on your time.

132
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
 Thank you.

133
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,560
 All right, then I'll ignore mentioning Philip Corso's comments.

134
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,180
 So what of my opinion of what's required to understand how they work and to build one?

135
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,520
 The simple answer is I don't know.

136
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,680
 But beyond that, I could say I would look for the following, four things.

137
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,760
 First, a way to cross the light years to stars without actually physically speeding past and

138
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,160
 through the space and space debris that separates us.

139
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,680
 Second, a way to interact with time in a reliable fashion through the equivalent of the so-called

140
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,000
 wormhole so that journeys would take years, wind up taking minutes.

141
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,560
 Third, a way to permit a person's mind to interact with matter so reliably that all

142
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,000
 you have to do is think clearly and equipment does what you want it to if designed right.

143
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,320
 Finally, to expect that the breakthroughs will come from unknown scientists, probably

144
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,040
 pretty young, who are looking outside the establishment's perspective of the solution.

145
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,820
 I leave you with this thought, that Arthur Clarke's famous quote is highly applicable.

146
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,920
 Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

147
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,180
 I think that the millions of years that may separate us from the alien civilizations are

148
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,520
 not significant because logic does not change with time.

149
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,600
 I expect that the laws of physics, which we have yet to understand, will be the same and

150
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,320
 so will the equations.

151
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,280
 We just have to find them.

152
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,120
 Does some black program already have this knowledge?

153
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,440
 Thank you, Dr. Wood.

154
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:02,320
 Could we now have Dr. Greer take 10 minutes?

155
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
 Thank you very much.

156
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,000
 I appreciate being here again.

157
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,080
 I would like to open with sort of a historical overview of advanced technologies that began

158
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:18,880
 in the late 1800s with the breakthroughs with Maxwell and also Faraday.

159
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,160
 It turns out that the Maxwell equations that were developed had a number of changes that

160
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,440
 resulted in what is now classic electromagnetic theory.

161
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,080
 This has resulted in a number of errors in the equations, which have been corrected by

162
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,480
 people who have looked at them very carefully.

163
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,520
 Between the late 1800s and 1929, there were a number of breakthroughs that ended up being

164
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,960
 suppressed that had to do with creating very high-voltage VHV systems so that you could

165
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:57,720
 create a vector into what has now been called the zero-point energy field.

166
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,800
 I refer the panel to the Jane's Defense Weekly writer, Nick Cook, and his book, The Hunt

167
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,040
 for Zero Point.

168
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,760
 This began to be explored by people like Nikola Tesla and others.

169
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,440
 I have a Department of Defense document that is on a flash drive for each member of Congress

170
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,700
 that the conference has been given, the citizens' hearings have been given that shows that when

171
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:32,540
 Nikola Tesla died, that this information that he had, which allowed for a car to run out

172
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,880
 of the ambient energy, was in documents confiscated by the FBI.

173
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,620
 I have a Department of Defense document demanding that the FBI turn these over to the DOD.

174
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,040
 The FBI refused.

175
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,320
 At any rate, science continues because the laws of the universe are, in fact, universal,

176
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,980
 and they can be discovered here or around Alpha Centauri or anyplace else in the cosmos.

177
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:06,880
 By 1928 and 29, T. Townsend Brown, as well as the Koloski-Frost experiment in physics

178
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,880
 in Germany, had determined that VHV, very high-voltage systems done in a certain resonant

179
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:20,120
 field could result in so-called electromagnetic-gravity effect, the lifter effect that has been described,

180
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,880
 which you see in UFOs.

181
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,940
 They also can create what's called a space-time bubble around an object so that you can correct

182
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,200
 for 1G.

183
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:35,040
 This is how these objects are traveling at multiples of what any aerodynamic physics

184
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,180
 would describe and can make right-hand turns without killing the occupants.

185
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:49,360
 Around this same time, there was, in the 1940s and the late 1930s, a number of UFO sightings.

186
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,080
 This included the so-called Foo Fighters.

187
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,320
 Yes, it's a famous rock group.

188
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,960
 However, the Foo Fighters took their name from the reports of these objects seen in

189
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,640
 the theater of World War II that were flying around our aircraft.

190
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,800
 We thought it was a secret weapon of the Nazis.

191
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,540
 The Nazis thought it was a secret weapon of ours.

192
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,200
 There is Jimmy Doolittle, the famous general.

193
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,560
 His nephew is a dear friend of mine, and he has testified that General Doolittle was sent

194
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,560
 by FDR over to the European Theater in World War II, investigated the Foo Fighters and

195
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,800
 came back and told Roosevelt, and I quote, "They are interplanetary vehicles."

196
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,540
 By then, there began a classified program, which was augmented further by events as mentioned

197
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,600
 in 1941 and then, of course, the famous Roswell event.

198
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,200
 Those events led to, as Philip Corso describes, a reverse engineering program, as you all

199
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,680
 know from the famous Wilbur Smith document of 1951 from Canada.

200
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,480
 It talks about that flying saucers exist, but there's a high-level team headed up by

201
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,040
 Dr. Vannevar Bush that is studying the "motus operandi" of these vehicles.

202
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,780
 These were the most brilliant scientists, Edward Teller, Oppenheimer, and others, Herman

203
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:15,500
 Oberth, amongst others, who were in this team studying how extraterrestrial vehicles move.

204
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,000
 In October of 1954, a key date I want the committee to remember.

205
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,460
 We have actionable intelligence from someone who has worked in the National Security Agency

206
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,200
 and has been in the vault.

207
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,360
 All of this went deep black because they figured out, at that point, gravity control.

208
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,880
 So since 1954, October of that year, we have not needed rockets, jets, internal combustion

209
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,280
 engines, and surface roadways between cities.

210
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,600
 I say this with authority that this is the case.

211
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:55,160
 Eventually, these breakthroughs in human discovery were complemented by the study of the extraterrestrial

212
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,880
 material that were retrieved from these events.

213
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,720
 And contrary to most people's thoughts, the Roswell event was actually a downing of an

214
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,960
 extraterrestrial vehicle by an electromagnetic system that was hidden in a radar dome that

215
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,200
 was switched on.

216
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,660
 And this is in an FBI document that I can provide for the committee and is on the flash

217
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,240
 drive given to the Congress.

218
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,600
 The result, ultimately, was that there were trans-dimensional physics that began to be

219
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:35,880
 studied that deal with the nexus between electromagnetism, energy generation, anti-gravity, and consciousness.

220
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,720
 And we have discovered that there is a nexus and that, in fact, there are electromagnetic

221
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,520
 systems that have been developed that can interface directly with what we call coherent

222
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,640
 thought, the same way that you can interface with a system with lasers, which is coherent

223
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,400
 light, where you sync up all the wavelengths.

224
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,760
 Ultimately, these breakthroughs were paralleled with amazing developments in the biological

225
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,040
 sciences and the experimentation with cloning.

226
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,520
 And this began many years earlier than was reported from Dolly the sheep in Scotland.

227
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,520
 This goes a little beyond, I think, what this committee wants to look into.

228
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,600
 However, you need to understand that the technologies that we have, and we were discussing, are

229
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
 not theoretical.

230
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:32,760
 We have actionable intelligence that any committee in Congress or executive action can find regarding

231
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,200
 current operations, and I just want to go through a list of them very quickly, of these

232
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,800
 facilities and corporations for which we have witnesses who can be subpoenaed by the committees

233
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,200
 of the Congress.

234
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,560
 This was developed at the request of Congressman Christopher Cox of Orange County, with whom

235
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,000
 I met, and was later further developed for the briefing that we put together for President

236
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,380
 Obama.

237
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:05,520
 These facilities are the Edwards Air Force Base and subsections, where I'm at the Dry

238
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:13,280
 Lake Bed where the Lockheed Skunk Works operations, Haystack Butte, China Lakes, George Air Force

239
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,960
 Base, and the closed Norton Air Force Base, where an anti-gravity device, so-called alien

240
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,280
 reproduction vehicle, for which we have the schematics, was seen by Frank Carlucci and

241
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,920
 others on our witness team.

242
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,560
 Several top mountain and blackjack control.

243
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,560
 The aerospace facilities there are the Northrop Ant Hill facility, Tihon Ranch, the McDonnell

244
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,660
 Douglas Llano plant, Lockheed Martin Hellendale plant, and the Phillips Lab.

245
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,040
 At the Nellis Air Force facility, so-called Area 51, no one calls it that.

246
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,820
 There's S4 and S12, Pahoot Mesa, Groom Lake, and a number of sub-facilities.

247
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,280
 The most important facility is in Utah, near Provo, the Dugway Proving Grounds, all of

248
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,880
 which is underground and the airspace above it is classified.

249
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,800
 There are no roads into this facility.

250
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,560
 The New Mexico facilities include Los Alamos National Labs with underground connectors

251
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,240
 to the so-called Dulce area where the biological work is being done, and Kirtland Air Force

252
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
 Base.

253
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,280
 And the complex there includes Sandia National Laboratories, Phillips Labs, Manzano Mountain

254
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,320
 Weapons Storage Facility, Coyote Canyon, and the White Sands Complex.

255
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,240
 In Arizona, near Fort Huachuca, which is Army Intelligence Headquarters, there is a UGB underground

256
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,840
 base where one of our witnesses who will testify worked on nine separate extraterrestrial vehicles

257
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,160
 that had been down through advanced electromagnetic pulse weapons, and there are several different

258
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,480
 species of extraterrestrial biological stored at that facility.

259
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:59,920
 The other facilities, and this goes on, include a special compartmented area of Cheyenne Mountain

260
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,540
 where we have witnesses in our team who can be subpoenaed, where we have tracked extraterrestrial

261
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:11,880
 vehicles in our solar system that were measuring 26 miles in diameter.

262
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,840
 There are also facilities in Australia, a key one being Pine Gap, the so-called Alice

263
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,880
 Springs facility, which is mostly a U.S. Air Force facility even though it is in Australia.

264
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,360
 I recently talked to the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia about this.

265
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,340
 Also the Redstone Arsenal and the Marshall Space Flight Center.

266
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,200
 We have a scientist at the Redstone Arsenal who works under contract for IT&T who have

267
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,520
 developed these trans-dimensional systems.

268
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,640
 He was under contract with my project to bring these energy devices out, and he was then

269
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,820
 threatened by a former CIA director and what I call the Goon Squad that went down there

270
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,640
 three years ago in March.

271
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,600
 This is just part of the information we have, and this information is on the flash drive

272
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,360
 given that you are all welcome to review.

273
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,360
 Thank you.

274
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
 Thank you.

275
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:12,840
 Well done and well timed because that sign came up just about three seconds after you

276
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,120
 landed.

277
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,680
 Dr. Vallone, ten minutes.

278
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,840
 I'd like to start with my slides and show them exclusively as I go through them.

279
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,800
 What I'm about to say is my own personal viewpoint does not relate in any way to the

280
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 federal government.

281
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,480
 Nothing I'm stating is reflecting government policy and they're my original thoughts as

282
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,360
 a private citizen.

283
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
 Next slide.

284
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,520
 This is a presentation of what I'm familiar with and my journey began in 1980 with the

285
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,600
 book called Sunburst Return of the Agents by Norman Paulson.

286
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,800
 The book was fascinating in the fact that there were a lot of very anomalous UFO details

287
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 shown.

288
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,800
 This particular side-by-side photo and the person who took the photo was a deputy sheriff

289
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,040
 holding the instamatic photo taken in broad daylight over Giant Rock.

290
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:08,280
 This is fascinating because none of this has happened since then and Van Tassel, George

291
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:14,960
 Van Tassel was responsible for holding UFO conferences through the 50s and through the

292
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
 60s.

293
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,240
 I even talked to Dr. Bob Beck who witnessed one of these craft and as you can see there's

294
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,260
 some type of force illumination below the craft as well.

295
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:31,280
 So I went out to the community and found what they were working on was a homopolar generator.

296
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,400
 Next slide.

297
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,080
 The interesting part of the book described the propulsion system as being 12 magnets

298
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,000
 around the outer edge of all the very large disk size of the ship carrying off electrical

299
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 current.

300
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,640
 Two disks in opposite direction provided the gravity force, whatever propulsion system

301
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
 they had.

302
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,360
 So this particular passage I reprinted in my homopolar handbook.

303
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,720
 Next slide.

304
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,920
 And also convinced my professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo to let me

305
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,680
 work on it as a physics project for my master's degree in physics.

306
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,920
 And I was very pleased to actually build a homopolar generator, test it for back torque

307
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,280
 and unfortunately I measured back torque, which means it slows down as you draw current

308
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
 from it.

309
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,880
 So the mystery continued.

310
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,640
 Next slide.

311
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,520
 I basically found that Dr. Ed Mitchell as you see here on the cover of Extraordinary

312
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,280
 Science magazine was also interested in the same topic.

313
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,520
 Bruce De Palma was the source of the interest and he was building homopolar generators like

314
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,320
 crazy, looking for investors one after another, which he succeeded in doing.

315
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,840
 However, Ed held on to his money, which is in his breast pocket there, and what was interesting

316
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,160
 about this particular cover that came out years later was that the serial disk is also

317
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,360
 shown on the same magazine cover next to the homopolar.

318
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,640
 So I thought this was sort of a coincidence or synchronicity and I ended up investigating

319
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,000
 the serial disk.

320
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,200
 Next slide.

321
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,400
 And I met John Searle in 1980 in Germany and he actually became kind of a curiosity to

322
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
 me.

323
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
 Even today he still is.

324
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,720
 He's still a living legend.

325
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,220
 He claimed to have these disks, as you can see here, hovering and he had a UFO experience

326
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,040
 when he was young and then he started building these things.

327
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,480
 So next slide.

328
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,680
 Basically tried to help him, connected with different people.

329
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,240
 He essentially became a little more well known when he gave a talk in Berlin in 1990.

330
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,960
 And then some Russians discovered him because of that lecture and the video and decided

331
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,800
 to build what they described as a single roller magnet assembly with 12 roller magnets around

332
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,500
 the outer edge of a ring.

333
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,960
 And so I started to think twice of, hey, this may be something related to what was called

334
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,620
 the Moo disk back in the Paulson book.

335
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,560
 And that's one of the biographies you can get off the shelf, "Anti-Gravity, the Dream

336
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,080
 Made Reality" by John Thomas.

337
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,840
 Next slide.

338
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,740
 So long story short is that these roller magnets are individual homopolar generators and these

339
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:14,000
 definitely seem to lend itself to voltage generation if the whole ring could somehow

340
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,580
 be propelled.

341
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,040
 And that's the magic and the mystery behind the whole thing.

342
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,320
 Well, the Russians had a whole grocery list, as you can see on the right, of all these

343
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,280
 anomalies that they supposedly measured.

344
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,640
 And so what I ended up doing, next slide, was to connect them to an investor, which

345
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,520
 I constantly do throughout these years, find an investor for the strange inventors, put

346
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
 them together.

347
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,840
 In this case, we went to the Department of Energy.

348
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,120
 The contact was very friendly to us, offered a Russian translator for us.

349
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,400
 We did due diligence for the whole day.

350
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,920
 And the investor was comfortable to throw his money at the Russian gold and roast inventions.

351
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:58,240
 And the outcome was, next slide, the big prototype at cost of a lot of money, which was built

352
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,720
 and completed in Moscow.

353
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,600
 And then it was retrofitted and completed again and again.

354
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,920
 And even to this day, it doesn't quite do what it's supposed to do, but it certainly

355
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,240
 looks interesting.

356
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,200
 Next slide.

357
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,880
 So back to the George Van Tassel story.

358
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,120
 Since this is dealing with implications of extraterrestrial technology, George's story

359
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,880
 is that he had lots of UFO experiences, even rides on craft and so forth.

360
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,320
 And his, what do you say, his download or his conclusion from all of these experiences

361
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,000
 was, hey, I'm going to build a healing chamber, a rejuvenation chamber called the Integratron.

362
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,760
 And it's right near Giant Rock, I've actually gone out there.

363
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
 Next slide.

364
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,160
 And it still is in existence today, integratron.com.

365
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,880
 And it's all wood construction with no nails.

366
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,000
 Next slide.

367
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,880
 And it's very fascinating because it has these unusual die rods.

368
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,560
 The whole assembly of die rods was supposed to rotate.

369
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,840
 And it also has a primary and secondary coil inside that looks like an inverted Tesla coil.

370
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,400
 So you get the impression that it would draw atmospheric electricity, since it's very dry

371
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,220
 there, it's feasible, this would work.

372
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,360
 And then charge up the inside with some of this energy.

373
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,440
 Next slide.

374
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,680
 So that concludes the possible rejuvenation implications of ET contact.

375
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,240
 And what I'd like to conclude with is the zero-point energy inertial shielding on electro-gravity.

376
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
 Next slide.

377
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,040
 First of all, zero-point energy is very famous.

378
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
 I wrote a book on it.

379
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,760
 I wrote two books, actually.

380
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,640
 And it's been confirmed consistently, even up to last week, where our future energy news

381
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,800
 announced some new polymer pyrrole that actually can't be explained unless two-thirds of it

382
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,960
 is due to zero-point energy.

383
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,520
 Next slide.

384
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,480
 And here we have the reason why zero-point energy may be important.

385
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:05,500
 And we'll see if she can insert the 30-second video that's supposed to actually start.

386
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,240
 I'm not sure if we're going to get a video or not.

387
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,240
 But, oh, maybe.

388
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
 Okay.

389
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
 Yes.

390
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
 Okay.

391
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,360
 This is an example of many, you've probably seen some of these already, that the craft

392
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,960
 is spinning, it's up close, it looks like a legitimate, authentic video, amateur video.

393
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,840
 And right about now you're going to see a very fast acceleration.

394
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,640
 And that's what we've been talking about, folks.

395
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,560
 And the important part is that this introduces a concept, which I'd like to share with the

396
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,520
 panel, and that is inertia is involved.

397
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,960
 And as we get to the next slide, hopefully we can see that, the inertial mass and gravitational

398
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,400
 mass are totally different.

399
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,720
 I repeat myself.

400
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,280
 Inertial mass and gravitational mass have nothing to do with each other.

401
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,720
 Einstein made a mistake years ago and called it the equivalence principle.

402
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,360
 I studied it even in grad school.

403
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,500
 I took relativity and I took general relativity.

404
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,360
 And so it's fascinating to me that it's sort of overlooked.

405
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,960
 Slide right after this.

406
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,680
 And the important part is that nowadays, inertia has been discovered to be a zero-point field,

407
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,960
 Lorentz force, by Hayes, Schwetter, and Puthoff.

408
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,700
 This is a seminal paper that's so important that it opens the door to actually controlling

409
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:30,000
 inertia and understanding how any ET craft or UFOs could possibly have fast acceleration

410
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,360
 right angle turns and maybe even travel through the universe.

411
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,360
 It turns out F equals V cross B, a simple Lorentz force at the bottom of the slide there

412
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,420
 showing how it works.

413
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,720
 So when we go around a curve and you feel that force moving you in the opposite direction,

414
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,960
 it's an electromagnetic interaction.

415
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,440
 Next slide.

416
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,200
 And this applies to relativity.

417
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,640
 I heard one of the gentlemen on the panel questioning special relativity.

418
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,560
 Well, that's inertial mass.

419
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,380
 That is the M in relativistic increase in mass as you go toward the speed of light.

420
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,720
 If you can shield inertial mass, miracles happen.

421
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,080
 And this is another demonstration.

422
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,840
 I showed this slide to the deputy director of the NRO, National Reconnaissance Office,

423
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,080
 in case you don't know what NRO stands for.

424
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,440
 And this was very important because, as you see, F equals MA, Newton's law, can be modified.

425
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,360
 If M can be shielded and it lowers, then A could increase for the same amount of force.

426
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
 Next slide.

427
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,480
 Oh, and by the way, the NRO deputy director said, well, things like this tend to become

428
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,240
 more and more classified until they're out of sight.

429
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,700
 He says it's easier for us to reinvent it for a private contractor.

430
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,440
 And I said, you mean the taxpayers have to pay double for something like this?

431
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,360
 And he said, yes.

432
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,480
 Here's another proof of inertial shielding, and that is the right angle turn that's photographed

433
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,760
 here with open shutter, 35 millimeter on tripod, 2 a.m. outside Stewart Air Force Base.

434
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,500
 The triangle craft started from the upper part and the shutter was open, made a tremendous

435
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,280
 right turn, and then continued as if nothing happened.

436
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,120
 Red and green lights make it look like it's conventional.

437
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
 Next slide.

438
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,160
 And Dr. Villon, you've got about one minute.

439
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
 I understand.

440
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
 I see.

441
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:16,880
 So the conclusion is an electrokinetic equation helps explain how we can combine electrokinetics

442
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,200
 or electrogravity and inertial shielding.

443
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,120
 Pulsed current will produce a force.

444
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,740
 Next slide.

445
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:30,060
 And I wrote a book on the electrogravity effect that's even present in the B2 bomber thanks

446
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:35,080
 to Paula Violet's work and research and originally starting with Tom's and Brown's research.

447
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,840
 Next slide.

448
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,920
 And the conclusion is, and I have to give thanks to Mark McCandlish, who gave a testimony

449
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:48,000
 of Dr. Greer's 2001 disclosure project in D.C. since we know once in a while such an electrokinetic-powered

450
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,400
 craft are put on display, as this one was in 1908 in Norton Air Force Base, which is

451
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:00,400
 also his entire testimony is reproduced thanks to Mark in my book Electrovitics 2.

452
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,380
 And this is also verified and investigated by Dr. Hal Putoff, and I talked to him personally

453
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,080
 about this story of Norton Air Force Base showing three hovercraft, and he did his due

454
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,360
 diligence with it, and he says he put it in his gray box of possible events.

455
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,480
 Thank you.

456
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,200
 Thank you very much.

457
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
 [ Applause ]

458
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:30,120
 We'll now be going to Roger Lier, if you wouldn't mind before we begin, could you tell us what

459
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,940
 DDPM stands for?

460
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,760
 Major Podiatric Medicine.

461
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
 Okay.

462
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
 Thank you.

463
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:47,680
 I want to thank the chair of the committee, Mr. Cook, honorable members of the committee,

464
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:55,000
 congressional members, my fellow colleagues that are here, and guests for allowing me

465
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,520
 to present this material to you today.

466
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:06,040
 I know we have certain time constraints, so we will do my very best to stay within those

467
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
 time constraints.

468
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:15,200
 I've already submitted a written document which I will read to the committee, and I've

469
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:23,720
 also submitted to you some paperwork which is of a scientific nature of our findings.

470
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:30,440
 But I have not stated anything of my own personal background, so I'd like to take a very short

471
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,320
 period of time to do that.

472
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,680
 I have a degree as a bachelor of science, a doctor of podiatric medicine.

473
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:48,040
 I did research with Dow Corning for bone replacement implants, I've done participated in research

474
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:57,020
 in tendon regeneration, I have a good knowledge of the biological workings of the human body.

475
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:07,320
 I was also, for three years, the chairman of a committee at the Cedars Lebanon Hospital

476
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,520
 in Hollywood, California, head of the diabetic clinic and director of residency training

477
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,000
 program at a hospital in Simi Valley, California.

478
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,400
 If anyone had told me at that time that I would be involved in anything in the UFO field

479
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:33,640
 or traveled to 42 countries and participated in the things that I have participated in

480
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:40,320
 relative to UFOs, I would have said, "They're nuts."

481
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,840
 Strange things have happened in my life that were very synchronistic.

482
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:53,720
 One of these was my cousin's occupation as a Ph.D. psychology professor at the University

483
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:59,360
 of Connecticut who wrote a series of books on the near-death experience.

484
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:05,600
 One of the books he wrote was called The Omega Project and it was funded by the University

485
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:13,200
 of Connecticut, but the interesting thing was that the story that he was trying to portray

486
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,120
 or the research project itself was to look for a common psychological profile between

487
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:26,320
 those who had UFO experiences and those that had near-death experiences.

488
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:34,360
 The end result was there wasn't any, it was a totally entirely different subject.

489
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:41,960
 At that time, I was just getting into the field and he asked me if I would like to have

490
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,120
 his research material because he no longer was going to be doing anything with UFOs.

491
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,840
 I accepted and expected to get a little package.

492
00:37:51,840 --> 00:38:01,600
 I got boxes and boxes and boxes of material, research work and books from some of the best

493
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,400
 known authors in the field of ufology.

494
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,880
 Now, it's a two-way street.

495
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,360
 I came here not only to present information but also to learn information.

496
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,480
 For example, I was very interested to learn that the Eisenhower speech not only talked

497
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:26,680
 about the military-industrial complex, but the military-industrial-congressional complex.

498
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,240
 I thought that was very informative.

499
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,040
 I also thought that it was very informative to learn that the oaths that were taken by

500
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:40,880
 military officers and other officers in government was to the Constitution of the United States

501
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,360
 and not to any particular committee or policy.

502
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,760
 I am here also as a student to learn from you.

503
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:58,960
 What I've planned today and ask you that favor again with time constraints is that at the

504
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,560
 end of my presentation, I'm allowed to ask you just two questions which may be answered

505
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,800
 by any one of you that would like to take the challenge of answering it.

506
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,120
 We'll be willing to suspend to do that.

507
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
 Thank you.

508
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,560
 I appreciate that, Mr. Chair.

509
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:27,160
 Now I'd like to read the written presentation that I've prepared and submitted to the committee.

510
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:34,840
 I with my surgical team of medical specialists performed 16 surgeries for the removal of

511
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,960
 foreign objects from those individuals who allege alien abduction.

512
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,840
 The 16 cases involved the removal of 17 separate and distinct objects.

513
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:52,720
 One of these objects turned out to be a small run of ceramic-like glass which was manufactured

514
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,800
 by Dow Corning Industries.

515
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,200
 In almost my 50 years of podiatric surgical practice, I have removed literally hundreds

516
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:11,360
 or numerous objects from the human foot including paper, glass, metal, stones, hair, coral,

517
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,600
 many other objects including secret metal.

518
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:21,120
 At one time, a patient came in with two gentlemen in suits and the proper identification.

519
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,120
 He worked as a machinist for an aerospace company.

520
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,640
 I removed the object and they said, "Please."

521
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,960
 And so I handed them the material that I removed from the individual's foot, later come to

522
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,640
 find out that it was a new material that was experimental for the use of rocket valves

523
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,520
 and rocketry.

524
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,960
 The individuals involved in this study all presented with no noted portal of entry for

525
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,720
 any of the objects that were removed.

526
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,800
 There was no visible scar formation and there was no interruption of the integrity of the

527
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,440
 skin even when examination was performed with a magnifying loop, not only examining the

528
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,080
 area involved but a large amount of the peripheral area.

529
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:16,360
 All the individuals in the study presented with positive x-rays or CT scans showing metallic

530
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,200
 or lesser dense foreign objects.

531
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,080
 Prior to the surgical procedures performed, the areas of interest were examined by the

532
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,600
 use of a gauss meter for magnetic or electromagnetic emissions.

533
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:36,240
 Ten of them were found to be producing readings on a gauss meter of 6 to 10 milligauss.

534
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,400
 That is a large amount for a very small object that varies in size from approximately 6 to

535
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,640
 10 millimetres in length and about the diameter of a pencil head.

536
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,840
 Now I understand that from the crew here and some of the television people I've worked

537
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:00,800
 with that a modern television camera produces about 4.3 milligauss of emissions.

538
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,200
 So here's a very small object producing 10 milligauss of emissions.

539
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:17,200
 Now in addition to these type of examinations we used frequencies of ultraviolet light to

540
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,760
 detect fluorescence in the area of the object.

541
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,640
 About 60% presented with positive UV light fluorescence with colour ranges from pink,

542
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,480
 green to yellow.

543
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:37,080
 One of the last surgical patients displayed a large chevron appearing area like an insignia

544
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,840
 on the outside of the right arm near the shoulder.

545
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,840
 He had no prior knowledge of it being there.

546
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,280
 We have also found that the removal of this fluorescent material with ordinary solvents

547
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,480
 only makes them disappear for intervals of approximately one hour.

548
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,900
 And when re-examined again they appear again with the use of ultraviolet light with varying

549
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,900
 frequencies.

550
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,960
 In addition by use of radio wave frequency detector we were able to detect that certain

551
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:15,040
 radio frequencies in the FM band both in the megahertz and kilohertz range were being admitted

552
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,560
 from the object.

553
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,160
 It was determined that in one case the frequencies detected and this is through a chart that

554
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,160
 I was able to obtain through sources that I will not be able to mention.

555
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:35,220
 But these frequencies were noted fixed or mobile deep space frequencies.

556
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:41,000
 Unfortunately our limited budget for performing this research has not allowed us to obtain

557
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,600
 a radio frequency analyser so that a radio wave could be captured and analysed.

558
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:58,640
 All the surgeries we performed were documented with eye witnesses, video and still photography.

559
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,160
 We established a chain of criteria and protocols for a forensic chain of custody.

560
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,280
 All the objects were placed in sterile containers using the patient's own blood serum.

561
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:16,560
 These containers are then signed and not opened again until they reach the laboratories.

562
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,520
 I will skip some of the material because of time constraints.

563
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:26,800
 We find that in all pathological reports there is no inflammatory reaction.

564
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,280
 There is no rejection reaction.

565
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,000
 There is no inexhaustive research of human science.

566
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,240
 There is nothing that we have found in material science that will produce absolutely no inflammatory

567
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,480
 reaction in the human body.

568
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,640
 These objects all do.

569
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,360
 Also in addition they are surrounded by a large amount of specialised nerve endings

570
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:55,520
 called proprioceptors and these are areas which are not consistent with Grey's anatomy.

571
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:01,040
 The pathology reports and examination we have sent to material science laboratories.

572
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,680
 Some of these include Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico Tech, University

573
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:13,160
 of California at San Diego, Southwest Laboratories in San Antonio, Texas as well as numerous

574
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,360
 other laboratories outside the country.

575
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:23,800
 ANS research scientists and our science board has enabled us to do some of our own scientific

576
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
 studies.

577
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,520
 I've already described some of the length and size of the object so we'll skip over

578
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,520
 that.

579
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,640
 Doctor, I absolutely hate to do this but your time has expired and what we are going to

580
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:43,360
 do though is suspend and allow you your request and I would ask the members of the panel to

581
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:50,160
 keep their answers, not questions, their answers here as short as possible so that we can at

582
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:56,000
 least get five minutes for our questioning of this technology panel that I am.

583
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,080
 How often do you get to hear from four PhD physicists, scientists, everything else?

584
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,440
 So I want to have plenty of time for our questions but go ahead.

585
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,920
 You want me to finish?

586
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
 No, no.

587
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:15,720
 I want you to ask the question if you ask me to change the rules in order to ask.

588
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:23,840
 What I'd like to ask you number one is do you in your present positions being retired

589
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:35,600
 congress people, senator, do you consider the United States to be a world superpower?

590
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,040
 Anybody that wishes to answer that?

591
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,160
 In terms of military capability and force, yes.

592
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:58,400
 In terms of intellectual capacity and moral guidance, no.

593
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,640
 Congressman Kirkpatrick, would you like to add anything?

594
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,640
 Exactly.

595
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,520
 Thank you.

596
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:17,360
 Now this will be very short, let's assume that what we learned from them up there, let's

597
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:23,160
 just assume hypothetically that this is a reality.

598
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:30,160
 What kind of a position would you think that the United States would be on a world scale

599
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:37,360
 if a third world country, a renegade country, would release the entire amount of information

600
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,720
 to the public of the world?

601
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,680
 It couldn't do anything.

602
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:52,200
 In fact, that's one of the things we hope that if the issue is brought before the General

603
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:59,080
 Assembly and it's voted to hold a global conference, then that conference will be its

604
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,080
 own guide, regardless of the United States of America or Britain or any other country,

605
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:10,840
 because it will be beyond their control, and that's one of the reasons why I personally

606
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:16,160
 would like this issue to go before the General Assembly and not go before the Congress, which

607
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,120
 I think would just continue the cover up that we've experienced from the government for

608
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,440
 the last 50 years.

609
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,880
 I would say that there's probably not a person in this room that would not agree with you.

610
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,800
 All in all, there's probably a person.

611
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:42,720
 That is not totally true, what you just said, but I do believe that it would make a huge,

612
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,720
 huge difference.

613
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,520
 I actually think it would make the people of the world, certainly the people of the

614
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,160
 United States, even better.

615
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,680
 I think if we had absolute knowledge of these things, peace would be more likely, a unified

616
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,700
 approach towards really finding out answers of other things to eliminate suffering and

617
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,760
 disease and everything else would be vastly enhanced.

618
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,280
 I think there's a lot of wonderful good.

619
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,300
 I don't necessarily think the United States would slip into second place on anything.

620
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:16,720
 I have a little bit of difference with my esteemed colleague from Alaska on that.

621
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:23,880
 I've got to say, I'm impressed with the credentials of the people we've heard from, people with

622
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,640
 doctorate degrees in medicine.

623
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:33,560
 We have, in other words, two that are clearly at the highest levels of biological science,

624
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:39,120
 if they're medical degrees, which I assume Dr. Lear and Dr. Greer have.

625
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:45,920
 I think, Dr. Villano, I think you're a physicist, as is Dr. Wood in the physical area.

626
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:52,680
 This is a unique opportunity to hear from physical and biological scientists of great

627
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:59,320
 stature and qualification, so I'm going to ask Dr. Wood a question that I started to

628
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:04,040
 ask the other panel, which I wouldn't have asked if I'd known this panel was this qualified

629
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,040
 in the area.

630
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:16,200
 One of the biggest concerns of people, one of the biggest reasons why people don't believe

631
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:23,860
 that UFOs have extraterrestrial origins is this whole question of the speed of light.

632
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:30,600
 I'm going to ask Robert Wood, how old or large do you think the universe is?

633
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,600
 You're a physicist.

634
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,600
 You've probably thought about these things.

635
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,640
 I think the latest estimate is 20 billion years.

636
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,640
 Okay.

637
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:43,440
 About how large is the Milky Way galaxy, which is just a very tiny little, little part of

638
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
 the universe.

639
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,040
 I think the diameter is about 50,000 light years.

640
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,040
 Okay.

641
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,040
 So 100,000 light years across.

642
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,040
 Yeah.

643
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,040
 Yeah.

644
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,800
 It used to be, in the books at that time it was 50.

645
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,800
 It's today.

646
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,520
 It's considered to be about 100,000.

647
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:02,640
 So if we only went 10, tell me if I'm right about this.

648
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:13,560
 If we were only able to send craft at one-tenth the speed of light, if the universe is 15

649
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:22,720
 or 20 billion years old, which I think you said you'd think, couldn't a spacecraft go

650
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:31,400
 from one end of 100,000 light year galaxy to the other end of that galaxy in a period

651
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:37,120
 of the time of the, this universe has been in existence 15,000 different times and go

652
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,120
 back and forth?

653
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,720
 In other words, why is the speed of light such a big problem?

654
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,880
 That's what I'm trying to understand.

655
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,080
 I'm not trying to say it stops the idea.

656
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:51,680
 I'm saying, am I right that a craft could go 15,000 times from one end of the galaxy

657
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,680
 to the other in the amount of time that's happened?

658
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:59,560
 We think in terms of our own time, but I'd just like you to respond to that.

659
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,280
 Well, I'd like to answer that in two parts.

660
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,800
 The first part has to do with the organizational name we are working with, Paradigm Research

661
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,800
 Group.

662
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,160
 And the idea of paradigm is that the concepts of science get changed suddenly.

663
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,160
 And Newton had a paradigm of F equals MA and Einstein came along and said, now that's not

664
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,160
 quite right.

665
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,920
 When you go close to the speed of light, you've got different equations.

666
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,680
 And so the old paradigm was overthrown.

667
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,680
 My thought here is that the current paradigm that we have that you can't travel faster

668
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,520
 than the speed of light is it might be overthrown by what Dr. Gehr had said earlier.

669
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:41,520
 Namely, there's a difference between inertial mass and the meditational mass.

670
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,240
 If we could go the speed of light, it wouldn't be just 15,000 times doing that.

671
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,040
 We could do that 150,000 times.

672
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,960
 In other words, speed of light isn't really a barrier to interstellar travel, is it?

673
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,440
 In my opinion, the speed of light is not a barrier of travel.

674
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,440
 Okay.

675
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,440
 That's what I wanted to establish.

676
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,440
 Can I comment on this for a moment?

677
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,440
 Yeah, please.

678
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,440
 Because one of the areas that I don't know how much has been talked about prior to today

679
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,800
 is the whole area of trans-dimensional physics.

680
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,920
 So if you're dealing with three-dimensional space or four-dimensional spacetime, you have

681
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,240
 one set of equations.

682
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:21,240
 But when you deal with very high-voltage systems that cause an alteration in what's called

683
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:27,160
 the spin, spin theory, mass, and also inertia, you have another whole set of equations which

684
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,680
 have not been disclosed yet that then become operative so that you can go from here to

685
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,000
 the end of our galaxy and back controlling for time on Earth right now in a matter of

686
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,360
 perhaps minutes or days.

687
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,360
 Okay.

688
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,360
 I don't question what you're saying.

689
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,360
 This gets into it.

690
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,640
 I'm going to reclaim the time just to say this.

691
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:54,900
 I can believe that we do have, yeah, wormholes may well be true and so forth.

692
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:00,760
 But what I'm trying to say is that the wormhole theories have not been established anywhere

693
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:07,600
 near as established as the speed of light and the first relativity theory of Einstein

694
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,320
 have been established.

695
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:14,480
 So what I'm trying to say is we don't have to establish, I'm trying to ask you, we don't

696
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:20,100
 necessarily have to establish some of these physicists which may well be true that could

697
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,740
 be established into the future in which there are some interesting indications from even

698
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:30,120
 the past that might be happening.

699
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,480
 So I'd like to, so will you respond to that?

700
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,600
 We run a conference on future energy almost every year now.

701
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,360
 It'll be one in July at the University of Maryland again.

702
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,960
 We've had David Frohnig there several times as speaker.

703
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:48,320
 He's a professor from the University of Adelaide in Australia and he particularly has worked

704
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,320
 on this.

705
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:54,600
 He actually has simulations of one time to speed light, five times and so forth.

706
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,800
 He treats it just like the sound barrier and he literally has equation comparisons for the

707
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,920
 speed of sound, speed of light and so forth.

708
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,600
 So my emphasis is trying to make it simple and that is the inertial mass is the key to

709
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,000
 understanding how this is possible and the special relativity equations which I'm very

710
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,520
 familiar with only deal with inertial mass.

711
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:23,300
 So if I could recognize my time really quickly, if we start talking about artificial intelligence

712
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:30,360
 being involved in the control of certain vehicles as opposed to natural intelligence being in

713
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,520
 control, couldn't we also overcome some of these barriers that people have been talking

714
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,520
 about?

715
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,960
 I mean we send artificial intelligence today out into space.

716
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
 Is that a possibility?

717
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:48,960
 The advanced extraterrestrial technologies do deal with technologies that cross into

718
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,640
 the conscious quantum hologram and directed thought and this is amazing.

719
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,480
 I got to be clear, I hate to cut you off but my time has expired.

720
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,040
 I can't violate what I'm making everybody else live by.

721
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:06,680
 But we will now go to Congresswoman Wilsey.

722
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,680
 Okay.

723
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:17,920
 The first thing I want to do is thank you all for adding an even deeper level of credibility

724
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,240
 to this hearing that we've had this week.

725
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,040
 Thank you very much.

726
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:32,000
 The subject of ufology is so out there that we have to, many of us have to just know that

727
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,860
 because of who you are, what we're doing is what we should be doing.

728
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:44,920
 So speaking of what we should be doing, my question to each of you to answer in the time

729
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:54,800
 we have is where do you believe that the United States ranks in preparation to meet the global

730
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,640
 needs for the future?

731
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:04,320
 And where will the brilliant students that will become adults like yourselves, only some

732
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:10,600
 of them have to be women, come from to meet the numbers we're going to need?

733
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:16,640
 Well, when you asked the question, my immediate reaction was when you said the United States,

734
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:23,800
 I asked myself who's really in charge of the answer to your question?

735
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:30,520
 And so I think the issue which we're dealing with is a truth embargo issue and this enormous

736
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:35,940
 secrecy which controls and dominates our entire process, maybe even including the educational

737
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:41,640
 process, but if you talk about the ordinary world that we mostly, most of us think that

738
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:54,960
 we live in, clearly we need to establish the ideas that new ideas, the discoveries as Stan

739
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,920
 Friedman said, come from doing things differently in an unpredictable way.

740
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,080
 So I think we need to emphasize the importance of creativity in developing the next set of

741
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:11,660
 equations that we need and may have already been discovered, but we need to make our society

742
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,520
 better and stronger.

743
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,520
 Thank you.

744
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,760
 Well, I think we already have everything we need to create a sustainable, poverty-free

745
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,760
 world.

746
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,960
 It's already extant and this is very good news.

747
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,600
 The very bad news is that there is a ruthless, deep national security state that the people

748
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,080
 I have worked with have run into that is this massive buzzsaw.

749
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:38,700
 And I think that at a certain point, we the people and the Congress and the United Nations

750
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,400
 and other countries have to come together and say, we've had enough of this nonsense.

751
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,320
 And I do not think this is going to come from an executive order from the President.

752
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:52,320
 I think it's going to come from people stepping forward and I wish to emphasize that as I

753
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,120
 did the other day, that in 1998 we declared these unacknowledged special access projects

754
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,160
 unconstitutional, a priori illegal.

755
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,820
 And we encouraged and we now have over 500 people who have come forward to give us information

756
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,960
 documents and what have you on this.

757
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,200
 And I think we need to continue to do that.

758
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:16,320
 I think we have to say to people who are really not responsive to the people that this is

759
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:24,000
 still a world of liberty and we have to be free to know the truth.

760
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,800
 Thank you.

761
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,240
 Very good.

762
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,240
 Dr. Vallone.

763
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,960
 Could I show slide 23, please, as I'm talking?

764
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:38,160
 What I'd like to explain is that I agree with our co-panelists and that is the United States

765
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:43,480
 already has this technology and I had the privilege of talking with a former black project

766
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,320
 engineer, spent the whole afternoon with him taking pages and pages of notes, one of which

767
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,680
 is actually in front of me right here.

768
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:55,640
 And what I learned is, first of all, he taught me all the details of creating an electro-gravitic

769
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:02,200
 layered semiconductor that with bismuth in between and magnesium and zinc, with the same

770
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:10,560
 percentages that when slide 23 pops up, you'll see that was published years before in a colleague's

771
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,720
 book called Secrets of Anti-Gravity Propulsion.

772
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:21,440
 And Dr. Paul Violette only let me know a year later, he said, "Oh, this sounds like what

773
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,520
 I learned from another black project engineer who actually was through Aviation Weekly over

774
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,520
 in England."

775
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:32,040
 So this is very interesting because my contact told me so many things I couldn't believe,

776
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,640
 I just took the notes down.

777
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:39,120
 But after I corroborated this with Linda Moulton-Hull's artifact as well, we have three different

778
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,840
 corroborations within 1% variation of the same artifact.

779
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:49,680
 In fact, slide 24, if she gets that up, will also show the actual semiconductor.

780
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,640
 But the important part is that we have the technology, students are contacting our Integrity

781
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,240
 Research Institute all the time saying, "What should we study?"

782
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:03,040
 And this is, I used to be a college teacher, you need the 13 chapters with questions and

783
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,360
 answers at the end of each chapter.

784
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:09,960
 And the books need to be written, the Zero Point Energy book, the Electro-Vitics book.

785
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,960
 These textbooks are the textbooks of the future and the students are already there waiting

786
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,640
 to study this stuff.

787
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:21,040
 So this is the book I'm talking about and if we progress to the next slide, we'll see

788
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,880
 the actual page that Paul was talking about.

789
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,600
 And this to me was amazing synchronicity.

790
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,200
 So I started to believe the other stuff that this black project fellow told me, and that

791
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,680
 is we already have a base on Mars, which was established in the 1970s, and I said, "Oh,

792
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,680
 I don't believe that."

793
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,400
 He says, "Oh, go check the NASA records of the greenhouse gases from Mars' atmosphere.

794
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,240
 They increased in the 1970s."

795
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:48,320
 And that was his counterpoint and so forth, he says, "We have a deep space platform."

796
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:54,080
 He even gave me a jaw dropper and that was the Gulf Breeze UFO conferences that almost

797
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,440
 amazingly always had a UFO sighting during the conference.

798
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,640
 He says, "I know the guy who ran that craft, it was a back to engineered craft and he just

799
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,720
 did it for fun, fly over the UFO conference and create some stir."

800
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,720
 So this is the kind of problem we have.

801
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,720
 All right.

802
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,720
 Thank you.

803
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,720
 These boys with toys.

804
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,720
 Thank you, Dr. Lark.

805
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:18,960
 I have a different approach.

806
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,760
 I'm very pessimistic.

807
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:29,000
 I believe that the knowledge, the basic knowledge of all this having to do with the, we've been

808
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,420
 using the term extraterrestriality as a more general term than it should be used because

809
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:42,480
 we really don't understand the entire ramifications of the universe itself.

810
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:52,200
 We don't know whether this is a multiverse, whether there are various time areas involved,

811
01:02:52,200 --> 01:03:00,280
 but someone does know and I believe that at one time at the days of Majestic 12 and Eisenhower

812
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:06,120
 and Truman and so on and the state that the world was in, it was necessary to keep this

813
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,760
 a secret from the public.

814
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,880
 But now I believe, again, I'm sorry to be pessimistic.

815
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:20,040
 I believe this has moved on from governments, the United States government or any other

816
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:27,680
 government into the hands of a greedy industrial complex that does not want it to change.

817
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,680
 Time has expired.

818
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,680
 Thank you very much.

819
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:37,480
 We'll now go to Representative Barton.

820
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,480
 Thank you very much.

821
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:45,560
 Because I want our deliberations to be most favorably perceived, I have one little question

822
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,960
 I'd like to get cleared up.

823
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:53,340
 I understand that a bit ago there was a petition being circulated in one of our communities

824
01:03:53,340 --> 01:04:01,380
 suggesting that the city water work should stop putting dihydrooxide into the water system

825
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,120
 because if in the future it was determined to be hazardous to health, it could never

826
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,600
 be removed.

827
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:12,600
 Dihydrooxide, of course, is water and it's true that if you put it in there, it can never

828
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,220
 be removed.

829
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:19,840
 My question has to do with a comment that was made both yesterday and the day before

830
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,720
 that we're looking at getting energy from water.

831
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:28,840
 Now I'd always thought of water as the ash you get when you burn hydrogen.

832
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,440
 So I'm wondering what am I missing here?

833
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,440
 Unless you're talking about nuclear energy, I'm having some trouble understanding how

834
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,520
 you get chemical energy from an ash.

835
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,600
 Can you help clear this up for the record?

836
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,600
 I can.

837
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,040
 And we did a great deal of research on this and actually have a proposal that I've given

838
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,120
 to the chairman for you to look at.

839
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,800
 Stan Meyer and other people have found that using very high voltage systems at certain

840
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:56,760
 resonant frequencies causes a recruitment of energy from the ambient zero point energy

841
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,640
 field that was spoken about so that you can break the hydrogen-oxygen bond.

842
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:07,780
 So you have two gases that you can burn and when you burn it, the only effluent is water

843
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,680
 vapor because it recombines.

844
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,740
 Now this is actually was done and it was operational and fortunately Stan Meyer died under mysterious

845
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,320
 conditions and he took those secrets to his grave.

846
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,720
 His twin brother is still living and people who work with him are still living.

847
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,320
 There are a number of them want to work with us in an R&D project to do this so we convert

848
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:30,200
 the internal combustion engines we have now to water engines and this is not a pipe dream.

849
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,440
 This is actually something that can be done.

850
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:37,740
 So my next question, sir, I can believe that they did this, but unless they're violating

851
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:41,800
 the second law of thermodynamics, which I don't think we think that you can violate,

852
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:47,480
 there's going to be less energy come out than you put into splitting the molecule?

853
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,800
 That's the whole point of what's called an over-unity system.

854
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,720
 Maybe this didn't get covered, is that you're setting up an electromagnetic pointing vector.

855
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,040
 And we can violate the second law of thermodynamics?

856
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:03,200
 No, sir, no, because there's constant conservation of energy, but there's another energy field

857
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,040
 that hasn't been accounted for, some may call it the Higgs field now.

858
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,040
 Thank you for getting this in the record.

859
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,200
 So there is absolutely no violation of the second law of thermodynamics, none at all,

860
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,680
 and that's a very important thing to understand.

861
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,240
 You're actually taking energy.

862
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:19,560
 It's been estimated that every cubic centimeter of space in this room has enough energy to

863
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,120
 run the earth for a day if you could tap it properly through these systems.

864
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:29,120
 So that means the energy is there, but you have to be able to create a vector into that

865
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,120
 energy field.

866
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:35,120
 The zero-point energy field he's talking about, the quantum vacuum, in other words.

867
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:39,320
 Okay, I just want to clear it up, because I think many people understand chemistry as

868
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,160
 I do, that water is the ash you get when you burn hydrogen, and it's hard to get energy

869
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,160
 out of ash, so thank you for clearing that up.

870
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:52,880
 I think that there's a general consensus that if these UFOs are real and if they're extraterrestrial,

871
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:58,520
 that they somehow have learned to do what we would love to be able to do, and that is

872
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,360
 have an anti-gravity thing.

873
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:07,260
 Okay, I don't know how much we know by reverse engineering these things, how much we know

874
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:12,280
 about that, but whatever we know about it, do you think that information is being made

875
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,520
 available to Stephen Hawking?

876
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,360
 I haven't heard he died, so I guess he's still alive, and people like him who are trying

877
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:24,160
 to harmonize the mysteries of the universe, relativity and gravity and so forth.

878
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,600
 Do you think it's being, I hope it's being made available to them.

879
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,720
 You think not?

880
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,040
 If you're talking about black project discoveries from back engineering, no, I'm sorry, it's

881
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,800
 the same as in the government.

882
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,640
 They're all in the dark, and they literally are opposed to anything that would violate

883
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,680
 their little classical laws of physics that they're used to.

884
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:48,480
 I know I've dealt with professors all my life, and unfortunately it's a big dichotomy between

885
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,920
 the ivory towers that they sit in and the black project guys that say, "Hey, the laws

886
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:57,400
 of physics need to be rewritten," and that exact quote has been used many times for those

887
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,520
 investigating the black world, it's literally called.

888
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,560
 It's not just the laws of physics that have to be rewritten, the laws of physiology have

889
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:15,880
 to be rewritten, because if there are entities in these craft, the maneuvers they make, we

890
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,880
 couldn't survive it.

891
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,080
 Yes, we can.

892
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,680
 That's what I tried to explain in my slideshow.

893
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:24,800
 I'd be glad to pull up slide 18 again and slide 17.

894
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,080
 This is a very important discovery that's been made, and I'm one of the few that have

895
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:32,760
 put these things together to describe 17, which is the inertial inertia.

896
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:38,160
 In other words, inertial mass is now known to be a zero-point energy effect.

897
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,880
 The slide you're looking at right here is slide 18, that's the conclusion of that.

898
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:47,800
 The previous one, 17, is the journal article that is probably front-page news and should

899
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:54,200
 be, because once inertia now is discovered to be an electromagnetic phenomenon, that's

900
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,720
 an exact breakthrough, in other words.

901
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,240
 If we go back one slide, the journal article obviously is something we need to refer to,

902
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,680
 because Hal Puthoff was responsible for that.

903
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:07,480
 Bernie Hayes, who I know personally, was also responsible, and they proved it.

904
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:13,480
 They literally did stochastic electrodynamics to conclude that it's simply a Lorentz force,

905
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:19,440
 F equals V cross B. And if you know what I'm talking about, V cross B, velocity crossing

906
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,360
 with a magnetic field gives you a force, and you see that in electromagnetism.

907
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:28,520
 But who would know you could see that in a movement of a vehicle?

908
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,520
 But you do.

909
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,000
 Because you're moving to the right, you want to turn to the right, and your body is going

910
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,200
 to the left.

911
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,880
 That's the Lorentz force.

912
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:41,480
 That's exactly what you see in electromagnetism, and now we find that it's in vehicular movement

913
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,560
 as well.

914
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,880
 So therefore, this is an interaction between the zero-point field, which is all around

915
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,320
 us, and the individual electromagnetism of your body, of the craft.

916
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,560
 And exactly that means shielding is possible.

917
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,480
 And once the shielding is possible, you've got all time.

918
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,800
 My time has expired, thank you so much.

919
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:07,080
 Now I'd like to go to our new questioner, Dr. Bookman, who, by the way, ran for Congress

920
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,480
 from my state not too many years ago, five or six years ago, I believe.

921
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,280
 Not against Merrill, though, against your colleague, Rob Bishop.

922
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,760
 Dr. Greer, you mentioned 25-mile wide craft.

923
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,760
 26.

924
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,160
 26-mile wide craft, and you mentioned that you believe the military-industrial complex

925
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,300
 has a program of shooting them down.

926
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,760
 Have we shot down one that big, in your opinion, or from your witnesses?

927
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,760
 No.

928
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,700
 To my knowledge, those have not been targeted.

929
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:40,320
 We do have witnesses, and there is a number of testimonies from pilots where attempts

930
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,240
 to target and bring them down have occurred.

931
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:47,680
 And I think that we have to understand that $2.3 trillion in unaccounted funds in the

932
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,440
 military-industrial complex have resulted in some very strange things going on.

933
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:57,080
 I call it the strange Lovian complex, where there are folks who are doing things without

934
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:01,000
 proper oversight from the Congress or the President that are really a threat to our

935
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,340
 national security.

936
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:07,600
 The briefing I did for the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, General Patrick Hughes,

937
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,400
 really focused on this, and I have never spoken of this publicly until now.

938
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:17,040
 But the big concern was, is that there was a cabal, or deep national security operation,

939
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:23,160
 of which he knew nothing and did not control, that was doing some rather dangerous things

940
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,760
 that could endanger not only our nation, but the world.

941
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,120
 And I think this is an existential threat to not only world peace, and I think we have

942
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:36,160
 to start thinking not just of world peace, but of interplanetary relations and universal

943
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,160
 peace.

944
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:42,880
 But to get more specific, there are portable EMP, electromagnetic pulse systems, and others

945
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:48,600
 that involve scalar or longitudinal waves that are, as opposed to a light wave that

946
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,800
 moves like this, or longitudinal, that have been weaponized.

947
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:58,440
 And as Werner von Braun stated in the last years of his life through our disclosure project

948
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:03,560
 witness Carol Rozen, that these sort of technologies are being deployed in this space and should

949
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,760
 not be.

950
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:09,880
 Moreover, there's a number of false flag operations that have happened, as was referred to in

951
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:16,460
 Gulf Breeze, where there have been objects that appear to be ET that aren't, and contact

952
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,680
 events that appear to be alien that aren't.

953
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:27,880
 And these include the manufacturer at EG&G near the Nellis range of a number of implants.

954
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,440
 As you know from our witness, Mr. Pollock, who worked with the CIA, they were manufacturing

955
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:35,440
 up to two billion of these in the '70s and '80s.

956
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,600
 This interview is on YouTube.

957
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,760
 There's a number of things I have not had time to go into that I really do believe are

958
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,360
 an existential threat to our planet.

959
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,400
 And I wish we had time to go into them now.

960
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,400
 Right.

961
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,400
 Yeah.

962
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,400
 Maybe on the break.

963
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,640
 I'd like to speed up on this too, if I'm doing my dual job correctly, I have about three

964
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,640
 minutes left.

965
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,640
 Yes, sir.

966
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,040
 Somebody time me and cut me off, or I'll go forever.

967
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,040
 Thank you for that.

968
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:03,680
 If I understand correctly, Linda Moulton-Hal, George Knapp, Dolan, yourself, have had conversations

969
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:08,120
 with people deep in the military industrial complex who've told you things off the record

970
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,120
 privately.

971
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,480
 It would make a great movie, I gather.

972
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:17,120
 By the way, Disclosure, the serious movie, is a great movie as well.

973
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:22,240
 If the United States Congress, or what would you need, what do you feel they would need

974
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:28,320
 from the United States Congress in order to be able to feel safe testifying on 60 Minutes

975
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,320
 or somewhere?

976
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,720
 I mean, I appreciate your point, Dr. Lear, and others have made this, that we have an

977
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:37,640
 oath to the Constitution, not to some independent agency that's gotten out of control.

978
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,640
 Correct.

979
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,920
 What would it take for those people to be free to their secrecy oaths such that they

980
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,800
 could appear in the media publicly on these issues?

981
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,440
 Well, I think the question is, would the media even allow it?

982
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,920
 As I mentioned, when ABC News wanted to do this, with 35 digital hours of top secret

983
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,720
 testimony, Ira Rosen was shot down by corporate ABC.

984
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,720
 That's one question.

985
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:02,840
 The other question becomes, I think some of these people, and the briefing I put together

986
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:08,780
 for the president that went to him via John Podesta, Senator of American Progress, was

987
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:14,460
 oriented towards getting those executive actions done, because we need federal, martial protection

988
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:15,600
 for some of these people.

989
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,600
 I know who they are.

990
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,600
 I'm holding their documents.

991
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,920
 It's part of, I hate to say this, part of my dead man trigger.

992
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,080
 If anything happens to me, it'll hit the internet.

993
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,000
 I'm probably more valuable alive than dead.

994
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
 I hope you stay that way, sir.

995
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,840
 Well, from the point of view of keeping the secrecy there, but I'm not going to violate

996
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,400
 people's confidentialities.

997
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:40,040
 What I will say is that there's an enormous amount of actionable intelligence we have,

998
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:44,560
 and names can be provided, including members of this majestic committee with whom I've

999
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,560
 met.

1000
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,600
 Many of them would like to see this information come out.

1001
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,320
 The problem is lethal force has been threatened and used.

1002
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:57,440
 I think that this has become something that needs an FBI investigation, Congressional

1003
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,760
 investigation, and subpoenas.

1004
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,080
 I have one minute left if I've timed myself correctly here.

1005
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,080
 I'll do this.

1006
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,080
 Yes, sir.

1007
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:10,000
 Are you saying there's nothing Congress can do to pass legislation?

1008
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,080
 When I ran for Congress, I called for legislation protecting whistleblowers.

1009
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:18,720
 This administration has been prosecuting whistleblowers like crazy, and I said, "We need to protect

1010
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:23,200
 whistleblowers on waste, fraud, criminal activity, and the UFO issue," and all the media focused

1011
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,720
 on in my campaign was ridiculing me over UFOs.

1012
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,840
 Thank you, media.

1013
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,080
 Is there anything Congress could do such that those people would feel safe?

1014
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:37,760
 Yes, they can issue subpoenas, and they can also require the Federal Marshal Protective

1015
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,560
 Services to protect them, and they would be.

1016
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,000
 I think that this is something that can be done if there was the will and the intent

1017
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,280
 within the Congress.

1018
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,080
 Barring that, I think we've brought out as many people as we can.

1019
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:54,000
 One of my frustrations is knowing too many people and having too much information that

1020
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,800
 I can't give actual intelligence on to the general public without violating ... I take

1021
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,280
 this like a doctor with patient confidentiality, without protecting those people's confidentiality,

1022
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,960
 but we have this information.

1023
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,840
 I would love to be subpoenaed so I could give it over to a proper authority.

1024
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,040
 I've heard that from George Knapp and others as well.

1025
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,040
 You're not alone in that.

1026
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,040
 Right.

1027
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,320
 There are a lot of witnesses that Protective would come out, and with that I see my time

1028
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,320
 is up.

1029
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,320
 Yes.

1030
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:23,120
 Thank you.

1031
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,120
 Thank you, Dr. Berkman.

1032
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:29,640
 We'll now go to Senator Grevelle.

1033
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:37,520
 I am not qualified to get into the technical discussion, but I would say this.

1034
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:47,600
 Dr. Wood referred to, if the black area has this knowledge, you've pointed out that whoever

1035
01:16:47,600 --> 01:17:00,860
 was the head of the CIA at the time shut the door on ... Dr. Valone, we've heard testimony

1036
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:12,800
 before about the fact that somebody was boasting from one of these black areas, which is these

1037
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:19,160
 contractors that we have the capability to take ET back home.

1038
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:24,960
 Is that something briefly squares with your knowledge at this point in time?

1039
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:25,960
 Absolutely.

1040
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,160
 That's a quote from the former CEO of Lockheed, I believe.

1041
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,160
 Yes.

1042
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,160
 Ben Rich.

1043
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,160
 Ben Rich.

1044
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,160
 It's a famous quote.

1045
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,160
 It's true.

1046
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,160
 I would agree with it.

1047
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:41,160
 If you think that's believable, and that's a quote from the head of a corporation, this

1048
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,160
 is criminal.

1049
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,160
 Absolutely.

1050
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:48,320
 Because we go back to what Dr. Grevelle was saying, that we have the capability of sharing

1051
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:54,960
 this technology and freeing up the world to an unbelievable level.

1052
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:01,880
 We stand capable of indicting, in the area of public opinion, the head of what?

1053
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:02,880
 Lockheed?

1054
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,880
 Yes.

1055
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,880
 That's right.

1056
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,880
 Skunkworks.

1057
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,880
 He knew what he was talking about, because he had all the countries ...

1058
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:07,880
 That's fine.

1059
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,880
 I'll accept that he knows what he's talking about.

1060
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,880
 He's depriving the world of possible advancement.

1061
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:18,120
 Here, all of you, all four of you, you interface with scientists in a whole black area.

1062
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,320
 You're trying to talk.

1063
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,320
 Where's their moral content?

1064
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,320
 Well, I can answer that if you ... Where is it?

1065
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,320
 They've got a hole somewhere.

1066
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:30,440
 Ben Rich wrote a book, and he specifically described the sundown rule.

1067
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,440
 I wrote about it.

1068
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,440
 It's on our website.

1069
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,640
 It's one of the recommendations we have.

1070
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:38,840
 The sundown rule should be enforced, and that is classified, fine, how many years?

1071
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:44,000
 You have to put a time limit on every classified document, and therefore, it's going down.

1072
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,340
 The sun's going down in 10 years, and it becomes free, and the public gets access to it.

1073
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:49,600
 Right now, we have about 50 years.

1074
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,600
 Fine.

1075
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,920
 Well, I've got to tell you, the Congress has tried to put that kind of a rule in on

1076
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,920
 the laws, and it's never worked.

1077
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,920
 I know.

1078
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:57,920
 Well, this is why I think ...

1079
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,920
 Good luck in your field.

1080
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,920
 It's at least one solution.

1081
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,080
 Well, this is why I think, in the tradition of Martin Luther King, in the tradition of

1082
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,840
 Susan B. Anthony, in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson, we should say, "The hell with these

1083
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,000
 games."

1084
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,520
 People who know this, I believe, as you said, have a moral obligation to our children and

1085
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:19,120
 our grandchildren to step forward with the truth, with the technology, and with the information,

1086
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:24,560
 because there is a criminal national security deep state that has basically thumbed its

1087
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,520
 nose at the Constitution.

1088
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:32,680
 For that reason, there is no justification for the continued secrecy.

1089
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:37,920
 I think that one of the things all of us as citizens have to decide is whether we're going

1090
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,220
 to do that or not.

1091
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:40,400
 Could it be risky?

1092
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,400
 Yes.

1093
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,800
 Do we have to make sacrifices?

1094
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,800
 Yes.

1095
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:48,020
 But part of it gets into ... Everybody puts their pants on one leg at a time.

1096
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:51,960
 I was talking to the Deputy Director of the National Science Foundation, and I turned

1097
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:56,160
 to him and I said, "We really need your help getting this information, this technology

1098
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,160
 out."

1099
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,280
 He says, "Yes, I'd love to, but it'd be the end of my career."

1100
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,200
 I said, "Okay, on one hand, we have the fate of the future of humanity, on the other hand,

1101
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,200
 we have your career."

1102
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,200
 Your selfish career.

1103
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:13,200
 Your selfish career.

1104
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:17,080
 I saw your film the other night, and I want to compliment you on it.

1105
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:23,040
 I thought that was awesome, but let me just ... I think I said it in an earlier day.

1106
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,040
 Nobody questions authority anymore.

1107
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:34,040
 The whole population is gutless, and we've had ourselves on the back that we're so wonderful,

1108
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,280
 we're the leaders of the world.

1109
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:42,880
 My God, we are stifling the ability of the world to go forward, and we put that aside

1110
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,320
 because we're questioning our patriotism.

1111
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,800
 Well, we need to question our patriotism.

1112
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:55,600
 I want to give one example, when the Pentagon Papers was sent over to the House and the

1113
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,720
 Senate, they were put under guard and a member could only go in and read them and couldn't

1114
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,900
 take any notes, and I was 42 years old.

1115
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:09,320
 When I was 23 years old, I could classify top secret documents.

1116
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:13,320
 Are we not at a situation where it's absolutely ridiculous?

1117
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,880
 Then after they were released, it was moot.

1118
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,000
 The Supreme Court was made moot.

1119
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,880
 The Congress was made moot, and the decision was made that any member of Congress can release

1120
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:31,400
 any information of all these secrets, and it hasn't happened since 1972.

1121
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:36,960
 The indictment is on us as a Congress, and that's the reason why when the whole purpose

1122
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,080
 of this hearing was, "We'll take this to Congress and have another hearing," boy, that's just

1123
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:48,040
 taking the issue and putting it on a shelf forever, and it just won't happen.

1124
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:52,240
 I'll yield for a question or a statement.

1125
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:58,640
 I just wanted to say the sunset rules actually are in effect.

1126
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:08,680
 The Brady gun laws sunset it after five years, and then it wasn't continued.

1127
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:14,640
 We never went back and visited it, so it's there when, and it depends on the issue, and

1128
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,200
 it depends on who's in the leadership.

1129
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:25,140
 The sunset principle is Congress has the ability to go back and see anything.

1130
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,880
 We have an oversight capacity.

1131
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:32,200
 If there's one activity in the Congress that's not dealt with properly is our oversight capacity.

1132
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:37,940
 I couldn't agree with you more, and in fact, when I met with oversight, for example, Congressman

1133
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:42,880
 Dan Burton, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee who were in office, they were very

1134
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,200
 interested, but what I have found, there's a disconnect between what people want to know

1135
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,800
 and what people want to do.

1136
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,360
 There's a fear of touching this subject because of the ridicule factor and other reasons,

1137
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,400
 and I think we just have to become more courageous.

1138
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,320
 And also know what you want to ask for, for declassification.

1139
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,040
 I'd like to meet with you later, anyways.

1140
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:07,180
 Could I mention there's an Office of Declassification in College Park, Maryland.

1141
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:10,840
 That's where the official federal government Office of Declassification is.

1142
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:16,160
 It's solicitable, you can approach them, and if you know what to ask for, that's the key,

1143
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,680
 then you can ask for it to be declassified.

1144
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,200
 Your time is not quite expired.

1145
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,000
 I see the sign right there.

1146
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
 It's already stopped.

1147
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
 Oh, it just expired.

1148
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
 There it goes.

1149
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
 That's why he stopped.

1150
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,120
 You used up my time asking questions.

1151
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,240
 Now we'll go to Representative Patrick.

1152
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,920
 Now I'm questioning now, right, as I understand it?

1153
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,920
 Yes, you're questioning now.

1154
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,920
 Okay.

1155
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,920
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

1156
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,920
 Excellent panel.

1157
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,920
 Excellent.

1158
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,760
 Way over my head.

1159
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,200
 I did see serious the other night, which is also way over my head, but I got parts of

1160
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,200
 it.

1161
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,080
 And the whole week has helped me get more and more.

1162
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:56,720
 But your sitting here today brings back for me the validity, the intelligence, and the

1163
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,680
 necessity of moving forward with this incident.

1164
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,540
 It's just you got to have to do it.

1165
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:05,520
 And you all have provided, without even saying it as an introduction, the technology that

1166
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,880
 exists in the world that we don't now yet display that we have.

1167
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,880
 We may have it.

1168
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,600
 We don't display that we do.

1169
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,840
 It's a real critical concern to our national security and to other things, so I want to

1170
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,840
 commend you for that.

1171
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,840
 I think that's excellent.

1172
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,480
 Dr. Lear, I want to go to you.

1173
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:23,320
 You talked about removing 16 objects from people.

1174
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:27,280
 I think in my reading preparation that was called implantation, and I might have that

1175
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,280
 wrong.

1176
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,280
 Is that the right word?

1177
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,280
 That is absolutely correct.

1178
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,280
 Oh, good.

1179
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,280
 Okay.

1180
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,280
 Hey.

1181
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,280
 I'm learning something here.

1182
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:35,280
 Okay.

1183
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,820
 Then when you -- and it also is related to people who have been implanted with something,

1184
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:44,220
 can you describe that it was a different kind of material that didn't meet the usual, which

1185
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:45,840
 means to me it came from somewhere else.

1186
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,840
 Is that correct?

1187
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,840
 That's correct.

1188
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:54,560
 I submitted to the committee a set of scientific documents that show some of the latest work

1189
01:24:54,560 --> 01:25:01,400
 and findings that we find in the material science of these objects, but I want to point

1190
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:10,200
 out, too, to my shock, absolute shock, was a paper that was given to me through the Freedom

1191
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:17,600
 of Information Act in which it describes all my work in the OSTP in the White House given

1192
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:24,880
 to President Obama at the time he was trying to raise money for the medical care bill.

1193
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:32,000
 And the individual that wrote the article stated that if my work was not correct, or

1194
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,240
 the work done by my team was not correct, and that it was secret work that was done

1195
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:43,440
 by some governmental agency, this also should be released to the public because it would

1196
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,640
 save billions of dollars in health care.

1197
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,720
 And what is the implication?

1198
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,720
 Break that down for me, please.

1199
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:58,240
 Well, if we took just the fact that there is no inflammatory response of these objects

1200
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:05,960
 and no rejection of these objects, you can see that you could take anything that we use

1201
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:14,760
 medically, a pin, a screw, a nail, a heart, a kidney, any organ, place it into the body.

1202
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:22,280
 The body would not reject it, and the individual would not have to be on very expensive anti-rejection

1203
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,760
 medication for the rest of their lives.

1204
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:31,760
 Now, that has nothing to do at all with the material science associated with these objects

1205
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,800
 that we have found here.

1206
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:38,240
 This is a very advanced nanotechnology.

1207
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:45,240
 These are nanotechnological devices in which nanocarbon tubes, either single or double

1208
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:51,960
 wall, I won't go into the whole explanation, but they can be elongated and weaved into

1209
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:59,600
 carbon nanofibers, carbon nanostrands, and they end in crystalline structures, which

1210
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:05,020
 are what we call orthorhombic, which are regular rectangular structures.

1211
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:12,480
 And we have to remember that in the early days when I was a child, radio, and you got

1212
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:19,080
 a crystal set with a battery and an air phone, and you were able to get a radio station,

1213
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,120
 that was a marvel.

1214
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:27,400
 So here's a very, very advanced, and when I say nanotechnological, I'm talking about

1215
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:32,200
 things that are on a level of the size of an atom.

1216
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:39,440
 Using the principle elements of certain materials, putting them together in such a way so that

1217
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:46,900
 you're actually broadcasting or switching what we perceive as a radio wave, which may

1218
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,360
 not be a radio wave.

1219
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:56,600
 It could be scalar technology, which when reaches our electromagnetic spectrum is converted

1220
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:05,480
 to a radio wave harmonic, which I know is a little bit complex, but it is sending information

1221
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,840
 to somebody.

1222
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,000
 So somebody out there is listening to something going on in our bodies.

1223
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:16,920
 Now we know that even John Glenn, when he went into space originally, complained on

1224
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:24,240
 public television that he had to swallow implants because this was vital information needed

1225
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:30,260
 on the physiology of the body to know what was going on in space.

1226
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:34,240
 And so therefore, your conclusion, you and your team, as it relates to healthcare, as

1227
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:39,720
 it relates to our country, as it relates to our budget, and to our phenomenon topic we've

1228
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,040
 been talking about today, what do you conclude?

1229
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:50,360
 Well, I conclude that if there was funding, at least funding, or open-mindedness from

1230
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:57,360
 the scientific community, which there is not, because they also pray to higher masters.

1231
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:02,120
 They don't want to lose their jobs, they have families to feed, they don't want to look

1232
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:07,520
 at this stuff in the way that we've looked at it for the benefit of mankind.

1233
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,560
 Thank you very much.

1234
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:16,680
 If we can bring up slide 25, I would like to show 25, 26, and 27 very quickly.

1235
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:22,120
 And it is, scalar waves are hugely important, because what Dr. Lear just mentioned is a

1236
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:29,520
 big, another overcoming of the speed of light problem with electromagnetic waves traveling

1237
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,000
 so slow, there's no communication possible across the Milky Way.

1238
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,960
 Well, it turns out there is, and this is a proof of it, the Chilbolton Crop Circle.

1239
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:42,560
 Based on the Arecibo message that was sent out in 1974, we all of a sudden have this

1240
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:50,440
 amazing phenomenon that shows a scalar generator, antenna, right at the bottom of the diagram

1241
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,440
 that copies.

1242
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:56,580
 This diagram actually is the original one that was sent out in 1974 from Arecibo.

1243
01:29:56,580 --> 01:30:01,400
 It's a digital message that was sent out with the most powerful telescope available at the

1244
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,760
 time, thanks to Frank Drake's study program.

1245
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:16,240
 In what happened in 1990, I don't have the exact date here, 2001, August 2001, next slide,

1246
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:20,500
 there was an appearance of the crop circle overnight right next to a radio telescope

1247
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,760
 in Chilbolton, England.

1248
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,980
 And the amazing thing was it wasn't just a regular crop circle.

1249
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:32,120
 This thing had almost exactly the same one-to-one correspondence to the Arecibo message.

1250
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,600
 Slide 26, please, and then slide 27.

1251
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:40,160
 And that's exactly what the thing looked like, the crop circle is just a bunch of crops that

1252
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,600
 are down or up, and then the next one is 27.

1253
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:48,320
 And we see at the bottom of 27, instead of the Arecibo antenna, which is a parabolic

1254
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:54,440
 dish, we're seeing something that looks like two circular objects that literally, it says

1255
01:30:54,440 --> 01:31:00,100
 a change in transmitter diameter from one of the online commentaries on Chilbolton.

1256
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:05,460
 And the very bottom is something that describes a scalar broadcast antenna that is actually

1257
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,640
 the answer to instantaneous communication across the Milky Way.

1258
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,640
 Enough said.

1259
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,640
 This is a big breakthrough.

1260
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,640
 Thank you.

1261
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:19,620
 Now we'll -- and now we'll go to closing statements from --

1262
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:21,360
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.

1263
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,760
 I want to say thank you for the invitation.

1264
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,920
 I'm certainly a much wiser, better public servant than I was before I walked through

1265
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,480
 these doors.

1266
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,960
 To my panel, my colleagues, you've been excellent.

1267
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,560
 Many times we are so busy in Congress, we don't get to know each other unless we travel

1268
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,880
 in what's called congressional delegations and do some work, or work on the committee.

1269
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,640
 You know best your committee and your caucus.

1270
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,160
 And beyond that, these things help.

1271
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,160
 So thank you very much.

1272
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,280
 And to the staff and all of you.

1273
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:53,920
 To the witnesses who have been with us all week, outstanding.

1274
01:31:53,920 --> 01:32:00,200
 I think it's America's loss that none of the press across this country felt the obligation

1275
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,840
 to cover these hearings.

1276
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:07,000
 The information that we've learned, that American people should also have learned, and those

1277
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,840
 who streamed God Bless Them probably did get some of it, will make them better people as

1278
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,120
 we confront the next hundred years, the next thousand years.

1279
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:20,080
 Because I really believe, and I wasn't convinced before I came in, but we did a little two-minute

1280
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,720
 interview on the close of this.

1281
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:27,840
 And what I said in mine is, I didn't know before and I still have a lot to learn.

1282
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,020
 But I'm willing to learn.

1283
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:34,280
 Because it's a universal problem and I want my grandchildren and yours, and our great

1284
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:37,480
 grandchildren to have a universal much to operate.

1285
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,760
 So on behalf of this Congresswoman, as I go about my day and catch my plane and hope it

1286
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,280
 lands smoothly, doctors, that I can come back and be with you again.

1287
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,940
 We've got a lot of work to do.

1288
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:52,840
 But I think you educate the people from the bottom up and not from top down.

1289
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,000
 It doesn't work like that.

1290
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,320
 We've done it in revolutions all over this world for hundreds of years.

1291
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,160
 This is a revolutionary issue.

1292
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:06,080
 And if we're going to sustain ourselves as humans, just a part of the universe, we've

1293
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,080
 got work to do.

1294
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:10,080
 To all of you, and I'm looking and seeing some of you in the audience as you presented

1295
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,920
 to us, thank you for allowing me to be with you.

1296
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:14,920
 Thank you very much.

1297
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:22,600
 [ Applause ]

1298
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,900
 >> Yes, thank you, Congresswoman Kilpatrick.

1299
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:30,880
 Dr. Bookman, you've got just a minute of announcements before the break.

1300
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:36,640
 >> Well, first of all, I'd like to say to the honorable representative from Michigan,

1301
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,760
 you ma'am are a hero.

1302
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:43,160
 You're a hero, just as much as any of these witnesses, when we reached out to former members

1303
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:47,240
 of Congress, the answer for many was, well, who else is going to be on that committee

1304
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:48,240
 with me?

1305
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:51,880
 I'll serve, but I won't serve with so-and-so, or I want to know who else is there.

1306
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:55,120
 You agreed to do this not knowing any of that.

1307
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,800
 You stood up and said, "Yes, I'll do it," and opened the space for everyone else to

1308
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,800
 be here.

1309
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,800
 Before you leave, I wanted to share that with you.

1310
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:08,800
 So, you ma'am are our John Glenn, first one up to orbit the earth.

1311
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,800
 Thank you.

1312
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,800
 >> Thank you.

1313
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:10,800
 >> That's all.

1314
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:23,160
