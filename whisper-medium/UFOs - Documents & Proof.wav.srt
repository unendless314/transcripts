1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 This morning you've testified before. It's a daily. Okay, all of you stand, and we'll have an affirmation.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 An affirmation. Ms. Howe is on the morning panel, so we'll excuse her.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 If you would repeat after me, I'd hereby affirm that I will tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, to this committee today.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Thank you very much. Thank you.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 We'll proceed with, and for the members, since we were really cutting short on a couple of the members, we're going to reverse the order.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We'll start with the congressman and then go to Darlene.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Well, no, I don't want to take any credit for that. That was Congresswoman Woolsey that suggested that to me, and I'm very suggestible.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Dr. Wood, please.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Yeah, I'm Dr. Bob Wood. Appreciate being on this committee as a witness.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I got a PhD in physics so I could become a better engineer, and it turned out pretty well for me.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I wound up working continuously for 43 years for one company, the Douglas Aircraft Company, becoming McDonnell Douglas, now a part of Boeing.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 My normal career there had me involved in the thermodynamics of keeping missiles cool, managing and selling the independent research and development projects

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 of a couple of dozen scientists and engineers, designing radars to discriminate between Soviet ballistic missiles and their decoys,

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 applying advanced technology to make the space station cheaper, better, and sooner, and finally helping to sell the Delta launch vehicle as the workhorse for NASA orbital payloads.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 In addition, I ran one project in the late '60s to find out how UFOs work. We didn't find out.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And had one project on remote viewing, both of them proprietary.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 My involvement with question documents came shortly after I had retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1993.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 It was about the end of 1994 when my former colleague, Stan Friedman, from our old UFO research project, called me up and said that he had received a fax copy

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 of an alleged war office training manual entitled "Extraterrestrial Entities in Technology, Recovery and Disposal." This is what it looks like.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Was I interested in trying to dig deeper? The answer was yes, and I called the possessor of the 35 millimeter film from which this copy had been made, Don Berliner.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Don was also interested in determining whether they might be genuine or fake, and he and I took the negatives to his local photo shop where we both monitored the process of reproduction and printing.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Don was further helpful in lending me the box in which the film was mailed.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 It had been mailed from a drug store in La Crosse, Wisconsin on March 7th, 1994.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And actually, you should have an attachment that permits you to see these images that are showing.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 The manual itself consists of 28 numbered pages plus the cover and one document page control little i.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 There were six chapters and four appendices listed, but only the first appendix was shown.

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 The manual was a simple summary of the project and a detailed set of instructions of how to handle the recovery and removal of extraterrestrial craft and living organisms or EBE's extraterrestrial biological entities.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Where to ship the parts, how to do all this, and how to deceive the public with security measures.

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 It was stamped with a security caveat of top secret magic eyes only on every page.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Of particular interest is a table that specifies where to send the parts or bodies, noting Area 51 S4 and Blue Lab WP-61, both of which have been claimed by others to involve government UFO storage facilities.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Also, the authentication interest is page I, documenting removal and replacement pages and the initials of the Magic 12 operations officer involved.

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 The two sets of initials are EWL and JRT. Neither person has been identified.

33
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 After I had a high quality copy available, I was able to make an appointment with a public relations person from the government printing office right here in Washington.

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 A long-time employee of the public printer, Mr. McCarter, was knowledgeable and helpful.

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 He read the entire document while I waited, stopped several times to look more carefully, and then said something like, "Well, based on the content of this manual, I would say it was probably a fake, but there's something remarkable that makes me think twice about it.

36
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 If you look closely, you'll see that some of the Z's are slightly raised."

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 This was happening with the type font in the 1950s time because the less used letters, especially the Z, would get some debris on the bottom of the lead, and when they dropped down, they sometimes would not fully seat.

38
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 This is so unusual that I would say there is no doubt at all that they were printed on one of the presses in use at that time.

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 We had one in this building and one in the basement of the Pentagon, and they were set up to handle top-secret jobs with all the security controls in place.

40
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Because of the subtleties of the shape of the F and G letters, we identified the type font exactly, monotype modern, a popular one in heavy use at the time.

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Our conclusion, this document was authentically printed by the government for some reason in 1954.

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 The success of this evaluation caused Stan Friedman to call me again and say that he had someone writing to him that he had received many leaked documents from various sources,

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 and that he lived in Big Bear Lake, a lot closer to me than he and Eastern Canada did. Therefore, with proper introduction, my wife and I visited Tim Cooper at his home there.

44
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 He said he was willing to share these documents because he wanted to determine their authenticity.

45
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 He had become interested in the topic because his father had told him a story about his own involvement in covertly printing a UFO retrieval report and had told Lin Stringfield about this experience.

46
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Tim Cooper shared copies of several of his documents from several different sources that were included in October 1998 presentation to UFO Symposium jointly with my son and colleague Ryan.

47
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 This was the first time that significant authentication reports had been presented to the UFO community, and the word spread.

48
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Actually, Linda was there at that meeting. The word spread resulting in a sponsor asking to further authenticate these documents and publish them widely.

49
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 The sponsor also wanted Ryan and me to make a television documentary on their authenticity, and it was produced and shown on a sci-fi channel as "The Secret."

50
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 We decided that there was interest by other researchers, so Ryan created the website www.majesticdocuments.com for easy access to all the documents we possessed.

51
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 There are 10 sources for 103 documents, 3,800 pages. The website shows 64 of these documents, including 27 of them before 1948.

52
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Many of the documents we have received from multiple different sources to Tim Cooper, we have established beyond any doubt in our minds that he was not the author of any of these documents in several ways.

53
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 We have original envelopes used to mail the documents. More importantly, we have used some forensic linguistics, including spelling errors, word and sentence length and syntax to show that Cooper's writing, of which we have a huge sample about the history of White Sands Missile Range, is inconsistent with any of the question documents.

54
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 It is clear that if there were secret projects studying UFOs, there would be written records. In the days of carbon copies, leaks would be expected to happen, so plans would be made to deal with them.

55
00:08:39,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Such plans would involve controlling the media as much as possible, while denigrating and discouraging reality reporting, maximizing the idea that it's easy to fake anything these days with computers. This is not true when you have original paper and ink, and recognizing that many of the documents were leaked well before 2000.

56
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Authentication of documents is a very orderly process. First, you establish provenance, if possible, usually unlikely for illegally leaked documents. There are two kinds of tests that can be performed, physical and intellectual.

57
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 The physical ones involve dating ink, watermark or paper, identifying the typewriter make and model, matching the type font and press, and comparing signatures, other notations and handwriting. The intellectual tests look for anachronisms, comparing the language use, and comparing with known authentic documents.

58
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 More recently, the use of computerized forensic linguistics techniques permit one to make an estimate that a specific person was or was not the author of a question document.

59
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Signatures can be nearly identical if created with a polygraph device that permitted Truman to sign five letters at once.

60
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 The identification of one aspect of a question document as being anomalous often results in a skeptic accepting none of the rest of the document, even though it might be filled with accurate information.

61
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 It seems to be accepted in the intelligence community that fake documents usually, if not often, contain much valid information to help get it accepted as genuine throughout. Each part of a question document should be evaluated for its specific information and appearance and background.

62
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 In the last decade, I have presented lectures in coordination with my son, Ryan, author of Magic Eyes Only, identifying 74 crash recoveries. My lectures are on the authenticity of the documents and the influence of the alien presence on our society.

63
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 For me, the leaked documents, the synthesis with the literature and papers of the ufology community have provided extra insight into how we got to where we are.

64
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 The conclusion I've come to is incredibly wild, that those in charge have been successful in keeping secret the greatest story of mankind while covertly spending staggering sums to create hidden underground resources and reverse engineer the technology.

65
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Until we can quantify the alien threat, how can we know whether these actions are good or bad? Let us hope, maybe with the help of one race of good aliens, that God will maybe do the right thing to happen.

66
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Here in the Beltway, I'm told that everyone has an agenda, very few want the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help be God. I think the American people deserve most of it, we paid for it.

67
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Thank you very much, Dr. Wilkins.

68
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Now, please, we've heard from you before, if you could limit as best you can so we can make up some time, please. Thank you, Senator Gravel.

69
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 To compliment what Dr. Wood has presented, I thought that I would try to acquaint you with some of the text, and if we could have the image number one. The title is Extraterrestrial Entities in Technology Recovery and Disposal.

70
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 At the bottom is the war office stamp, Majestic 12 Group, April 1954, image two.

71
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 This manual has been prepared especially for Majestic 12 units. Its purpose is to present all aspects of Majestic 12 so authorized personnel will have a better understanding of the goals of the group.

72
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Be able to more expertly deal with unidentified flying objects, extraterrestrial technology and entities, and increase the efficiency of future operations, image three.

73
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Operation Majestic 12 was established by special classified presidential order on September 24, 1947, at the recommendation of Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal and Dr. Vannevar Bush, Chairman of the Joint Research and Development Board.

74
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Operations are carried out under a top secret research and development intelligence group, directly responsible only to the President of the United States.

75
00:13:38,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 The goals of the MJ-12 group, image four, are as follows. The recovery for scientific study of all materials and devices of a foreign or extraterrestrial manufacturer that may become available. Such material and devices will be recovered by any and all means deemed necessary by the group, the MJ-12 group.

76
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 The recovery for scientific study of all entities and remains of entities not of terrestrial origin, which may become available through independent action by those entities or by misfortune or military action, meaning we might shoot them down.

77
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 The establishment and administration of special teams to accomplish the above operations. The establishment and administration of special secure facilities located at secret locations within the continental borders of the United States for the receiving, processing, analysis and scientific study of any and all material and entities classified as being of extraterrestrial origin by the group of the special teams.

78
00:14:48,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Establishment and administration of covert operation to be carried out in concert with central intelligence to effect the recovery for the United States of extraterrestrial technology and entities which may come down inside the territory of or fall into the possession of foreign powers.

79
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 The establishment and maintenance of absolute top secrecy concerning all the above operations. The current situation. It is considered as far as the current situation is concerned that there are few indications that these objects and their builders pose a direct threat to the security of the United States, despite the uncertainty as to their ultimate motives in coming here.

80
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Certainly the technology possessed by these beings far surpasses anything known to modern science, yet their presence here seems to be benign, and they seem to be avoiding contact with our species, at least for the present.

81
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Several dead entities have been recovered along with a substantial amount of wreckage and devices from down craft, all of which are now under study at various locations. No attempt has been made by extraterrestrial entities either to contact authorities or to recover their dead counterparts of the down craft, even though one of the crashes was the result of direct military action.

82
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 The greatest threat at this time arises from the acquisition and study of such advanced technology by foreign powers unfriendly to the United States. It is for this reason that the recovery and study of this type of material by the United States has been given such a high priority.

83
00:16:36,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Image 5. Extraterrestrial technology is defined as follows. Aircraft identified as not manufactured in the United States or any terrestrial foreign powers, including experimental military or civilian aircraft. Aircraft in this category are generally known as unidentified flying objects or UFOBs.

84
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Such aircraft may appear as one of several shapes and configurations and exhibit extraordinary flight characteristics. Objects and devices of unknown origin or function manufactured by processes or of materials not consistent with current technology or scientific knowledge.

85
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Wreckage of any aircraft thought to be of extraterrestrial manufacture or origin. Such wreckage may be the results of accidents or military action. Materials that exhibit unusual or extraordinary characteristics not consistent with current technology or scientific knowledge.

86
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Extraterrestrial biological entities, acronym all caps E-B-E-S, are described as responsible for their development, are demonstrably different from those postulated or observed in Homo sapien.

87
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Next slide. Description of craft. Documented extraterrestrial craft, UFOBs, are classified in one of four categories based on general shape as follows. Elliptical or disc shape. This type of craft is of a metallic construction and dull aluminum in color.

88
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 They have the appearance of two pie pans or shallow dishes pressed together and may have a raised dome on the top or bottom. No seams or joints are visible on the surface giving the impression of one piece construction.

89
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Disks are estimated from 50 to 300 feet in diameter and the thickness is approximately 15% of the diameter, not including the dome, which is 30% of the disc diameter and extends another four to six feet above the main body of the disc.

90
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 The dome may or may not include windows or ports and ports are present around the lower rim of the disc in some instances. Some disc shaped craft are equipped with lights on the top and bottom and also around the rim.

91
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 These lights are not visible when the craft is at rest or not functioning. There are generally no visible antenna or projections. Landing gear consists of three extendable legs ending in circular landing pads. That's at least in some cases not all.

92
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 When fully extended this landing gear supports the main body two to three feet above the surface at the lowest point. A rectangular hatch is located along the equator or on the lower surface of the disc.

93
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 There are fuselage or cigar shapes. Documented reports of this type of craft are extremely rare. Air Force radar reports indicate they are approximately 2000 feet long and 95 feet thick and apparently they do not operate in the lower atmosphere.

94
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Very little information is available on the performance of these craft, but radar reports have indicated speeds in excess of 7000 miles per hour. They do not appear to engage in the violent and erratic maneuvers associated with the smaller types of craft.

95
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 There are ovoid or circular shapes. This type of craft is described as being shaped like an ice cream cone being rounded at the large end and tapering to a near point at the other end.

96
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 They are approximately 30 to 40 feet long and the thick end diameter is approximately 20% of the length. There is an extremely bright light at the pointed end. There is also airfoil or triangular shape. This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of the observations.

97
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 The radar indicates an isosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings, but they are believed capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to those exceeding the performance of the previous craft.

98
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Next slide. Description of extraterrestrial biological entities, acronym EBES. Examination of remains recovered from wreckage of UFOBs indicates that extraterrestrial biological entities may be classified into two distinct categories as follows.

99
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Eba type one, these entities are humanoid and might be mistaken for human beings of the oriental race have seen from a distance. They are bipedal, five foot, four inches in height and weigh 80 to 100 pounds.

100
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Proportionally they are similar to humans, although the cranium is somewhat larger and more rounded. The skin is a pale chalky yellow in color, thick and slightly pebbled in appearance. The eyes are small wide set almond shape with brownish black irises with very large pupils.

101
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 The whites of the eyes are not like that of humans but have a pale gray cast.

102
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Eba type two, these entities are... Could I interrupt you? What are you reading from again? I want to emphasize that.

103
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 The SOM 101 Majestic 12 Group Technical Operations Manual that Dr. Wood presented his reasons for why it is real. It is entitled "Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology Recovery and Disposal Top Secret Magic Eyes Only" and this was stamped April 1954, 1954 by Majestic 12 Group with the war stamp that was in use

104
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 through the early 50s before the Pentagon. So this is a government document? This is a government document that was printed in 1954 and if this was printed in 1954, it was written before 1954 and that the 1947 Roswell crashes are part of what this is talking about

105
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 and I was only going to conclude so that you would realize how much detail in 1954 the government of the United States had not only about the types of craft but the types of beings that we have retrieved and we have in a variety of underground facilities.

106
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 You have made your point very well and I would like to go on to the next witness. Our Canadian friends, Dr. Friedman, yours.

107
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Mr. Friedman and I am a Canadian and an American. I am a bifurcated. It is a privilege to be here representing both countries if you will. I found the proceedings fascinating. I would like to throw in a comment that isn't in the written piece that I submitted.

108
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Within two weeks of the start of World War II, a person was appointed to be the chief censor of the United States to make sure that material that might be of assistance to the enemy not be released.

109
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Two interesting aspects of that are that the word uranium was not to show up anywhere after a while and that the effects of the Japanese fugo balloons, balloons carrying incendiaries which were supposed to cause fires and all that sort of thing, nothing was to be said about their impact so that they wouldn't know whether or not they were being useful or not.

110
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 So censorship is a major part of military operations if you will.

111
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 The second thing that I'd like to note is that we've talked about the press, we've talked about the government, the witnesses, what we haven't talked about, and the press of course, but what we haven't talked about is the scientific community and their failure to take this issue into consideration.

112
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I've given 700 lectures at colleges and technical groups and while I've been extremely well received, what I also find is that there are many, many professors who think there's nothing to this subject who are perfectly willing to say stupid things really about the impossibility of this, that, or the other thing.

113
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Four basic rules for debunkers which I have found. We need to be cognizant of this. First, don't bother me with the facts, my mind's made up. Second, what the public doesn't know, I'm not going to tell.

114
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Third, if you can't attack the data, attack the people. And fourth, do your research by proclamation. Investigation is too much trouble and nobody will know the difference anyway.

115
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 So that's the kind of climate we're in here. Okay, now to get to my prepared brief text.

116
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I must admit that I am a document hound and have visited 20 different archives, including many visits to the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Reagan Presidential Archives, the National Archives, the Library of Congress Manuscript Division.

117
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 There have been special sites such as the Harvard Archives, papers of Donald Menzel, the Princeton Archives, papers of James Forrestal, MIT Archives, papers of Vannevar Bush, the American Philosophical Society Library, which has papers of Edward Condon,

118
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Donald Menzel, Philip Class, Boston University Archives, John Fuller, Ben Simon. There have been surprises and I've seen many phony documents, not at archives.

119
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Especially ones supposedly dealing with the Majestic 12 Group that you've already heard about. And I note with interest that all the copies of my book Top Secret Magic are gone.

120
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Did the government send somebody in to buy them all up so you wouldn't have access? That's a parenthetical comment.

121
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I didn't bring that many books. If I'd known they were going to do that, I would have brought more. There have been surprises in my investigations, especially ones about documents supposedly dealing with the Majestic 12 Group.

122
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 I am fortunate that I worked under security for 14 years. I can't hold a candle to Bob, he worked for 40 years, but I dealt often with classified documents and learned the rules of the game.

123
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I have found that there are many misconceptions about documents. These include a) documents are periodically reviewed for declassification and must be declassified after a certain number of years.

124
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 That's simply not true. It happens sometimes, but it's not a rule.

125
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 b) People working on classified projects such as Majestic 12 would of course talk to a spouse about what they were doing.

126
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 I had a clearance for 14 years, never talked to my wife about classified work. Dr. Vannevar Bush's secretary told me she worried about saying something classified in her sleep because her husband did not have a clearance.

127
00:28:44,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 c) Having a certain level of clearance, such as top secret, gives one access to all top secret documents. This is false. One needs a need to know. I couldn't get access to nuclear submarine radiation shielding information, though I had the appropriate security clearance.

128
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 But I couldn't get a need to know from Admiral Rickover for my aircraft nuclear propulsion radiation shielding work. The clearance wasn't the problem, the need to know was the problem.

129
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And I must say, there are people in Washington who think because there are big shots in Washington, if something were going on about this, they would know about it, even though they don't know about it.

130
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 There's the notion that higher security documents can be referenced in lower security ones. That's not true either. People goof on occasion, but also I've been challenged.

131
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 After all, Stan, all documents have been scanned and are easily accessed from a home computer. What are you talking about going either and there to find truth?

132
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I wish that were so. There are an awful lot of documents that haven't been scanned and aren't available, especially at the archives.

133
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 It would make life a lot simpler. There are some special archives where you can get that done. In 1970, when I worked for Bob briefly at McDonnell Douglas, I had a search done of government contract reports using the key word, one key word, magneto aerodynamics.

134
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 900 documents were found, of which 90% were classified. I suspect some were for black projects and maybe even dealing with plasmas and UFOs, which is an area I'm particularly intrigued with.

135
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 I've spent a great deal of effort on the question of legitimacy of the Majestic 12 documents and reported my findings in my book, Top Secret Magic, in an update chapter in my book, Flying Saucers in Science, and my final report on Operation Majestic 12.

136
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 I believe I have dealt with all the anti-arguments about the Eisenhower briefing document, the Truman-Forestall memo, the Cutler-Twining memo. All three stand up to the attacks.

137
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 For example, this includes proving that Dr. Donald Menzel, supposedly a skeptic, did loads of very classified work, though unknown to the outside world.

138
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 In the letter to John F. Kennedy, which I found at the Harvard Archives, there's Dr. Menzel telling John Kennedy that he had a longer continuous association with the National Security Agency and its Navy predecessor, more than 30 years as of 1960, than anybody else in the country.

139
00:31:39,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 When we are properly cleared to each other, I can tell you more. And yet, there is no indication in two issues of Sky and Telescope magazine dedicated to Dr. Menzel in which his post-World War II intense involvement with all kinds of classified activities was even mentioned.

140
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 One was on the time of his death. One was the 100th anniversary of his birth. But nobody knew about this stuff until I, to my shock, found this out.

141
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 I showed one of the arguments was made by Philip Class, who was an aviation week and space technology reporter right in this town, and the go-to man for somebody looking for a debunker.

142
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And he said everything was baloney. He claimed that the proof that those documents are fault was cleared.

143
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 One of the documents used a pica typeface, and he had nine documents from the National Security Council that were an elite type. Therefore, the documents were fraudulent.

144
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Now, he made it worth my while to prove him wrong. He offered me $100 each for every genuine NSC document meeting all kinds of specifications done in the same size and style type, up to a limit of 10, unfortunately, or I'd have been a wealthy man.

145
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 He had never been to the Eisenhower Library. I spent a lot of time there. I was going soon. He gave me 60 days.

146
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 I went. I found 14. I copied them. I sent him a copy and an invoice for $1,000, the limit. He paid me, told everybody about challenging me, nobody about paying me.

147
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 He also got very upset when I showed a copy of his check in one of the books that I wrote.

148
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Was that one minute that I saw there? Ouch. Well, okay. His check is in one of my books. A copy of his check is in one of my books.

149
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 I want to say that archivists can be helpful, that there have been a lot of phony arguments and a lot of people who don't do their homework.

150
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Every top secret document has to have a top secret control number. I was told that several times. It's a lie.

151
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 I got two archivists saying, "We got loads of top secret documents without top secret control numbers."

152
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Incidentally, with regard to class, a lot of his papers are up in Philadelphia at the American Philosophical Society Library.

153
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 There was no Friedman fight. We corresponded for 20 years. I don't think he wanted anybody to know that he paid me.

154
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 That's why I was so mad that I published a copy of his check.

155
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 There are also times, just one last point, when a perfectly legitimate document might have a false claim in it.

156
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 For example, General Twining wrote a letter to a pretty good-sized group of people in which he expressed a desire,

157
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 "Wouldn't it be great if we had pieces of a saucer?" People have interpreted this as saying there weren't any such pieces.

158
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 A lot of the people that were getting this memo didn't have a need to know for this stuff, so he had a lie. That's the way it goes.

159
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Thank you. It's a fascinating area.

160
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Thank you very much. We'll go to our next witness.

161
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no written testimony. If you have a written testimony there, it's actually for tomorrow.

162
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 I just wanted to be added to this panel today to talk about one particular document.

163
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 I have a series of documents. It's got a memorandum on the top. I'll just be highlighting little bits and pieces of that.

164
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I do have a statement that I want to read. I have testified in front of this committee a number of times.

165
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 I would like to just say that it has been an honour to testify in front of this committee.

166
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 We in the UFO community have complained for years that we have an important issue and that nobody has listened to us.

167
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Unlike the uninformed newspaper articles that continue to be published this morning, this committee has done its research to prepare for our testimony.

168
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 You have listened carefully to our testimony, and most importantly, you have treated us with respect.

169
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 The latest Gallup poll places the approval rating at Congress at 15%.

170
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 I am quite sure that in this room, your approval rating is much higher than that.

171
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Lastly, I'd like to say that you have restored my faith in the fact that Congress, if they were to act like you on the panel have acted,

172
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 would be an effective tool in a modern democracy.

173
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Now, as to my testimony, I just want to go through these documents.

174
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 The document I'm going to talk about is, if it's not the most important document in ufology, it's one of the most important documents.

175
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I want to just highlight some situations around that document.

176
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 First, we should look at the Rockefeller slide.

177
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Can we put that up on the screen?

178
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Based on Senator Graval's statement yesterday that we should be a little more aggressive in what we do, I've taken his advice.

179
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 These are the famous Rockefeller initiative documents, the 1,000 pages of documents that were released to me by the Clinton Library,

180
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 and they have gone missing.

181
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 The Clinton say they don't have them.

182
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 National Archives says they don't have them.

183
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 I filed an appeal.

184
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 They've denied the appeal.

185
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 So what I've done, based on what Mr. Graval said yesterday, I intend to send them back to the Clinton Library,

186
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 and it's going to be kind of embarrassing that they're going to get it from a foreign citizen,

187
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 but we'll see what they do, whether they put this back in the presidential record.

188
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 These are 1,000 pages of documents that the Clinton say they no longer have.

189
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Now, as to the documents, the document I'm going to talk quickly about is the Top Secret Memo.

190
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 It's a 1950 document from Canada, but I want to sort of go around the documents that talk about why this is so important.

191
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 If you took a look at the top document called Memorandum there, you will see -- to give you some background --

192
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 in Canada, there were four different organizations that controlled UFO files.

193
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 There was the Department of Transport.

194
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 There was the National Research Council.

195
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 There was the RCMP, and there was the Department of Defense.

196
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 The Canadians, regardless of what anybody wants to say, are playing the same game as the Americans.

197
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 In the late 1960s, they shut down their UFO program, and they released all the siting files,

198
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 which is what all the governments are doing.

199
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 They're just releasing their siting files.

200
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 But the actual discussion behind the siting files as to what does the president say,

201
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 what does the head of the military think about this, what does the prime minister of Canada think about this,

202
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 that is all the stuff behind.

203
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 That is the stuff that you will not see.

204
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 People will release the siting files, but they really don't mean anything.

205
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 So in this memorandum, which is the document -- you've got it up there.

206
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 I'll read just the one paragraph.

207
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 It says -- and what has happened here is all the documents in Canada, the siting file material,

208
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 has been moved in the 1960s to the National Research Council,

209
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 because nobody wants the documents, nobody knows what to do with them.

210
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 So the National Research Council gets stuck with these documents.

211
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 And this is a memo from somebody in the Department of Defense

212
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 talking about the fact that Project Magnet document is in these files that have come to you.

213
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 And he gives the warnings.

214
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 He says you should note here that the discussions behind Project Magnet are part of this file.

215
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 And then he says at no time should this be made available to the public.

216
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 If you read the very last line talking about the stuff, the discussions behind the Project Magnet files,

217
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 he says a copy of the Project Magnet file is attached to this.

218
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 The original is attached and should not be destroyed until such time as the UFO subject has cooled off.

219
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 So the intention was that the Project Magnet, the material behind Project Magnet,

220
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 the discussions as to what was going on would be destroyed.

221
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Thanks to Stanton Freeman, who's sitting beside me.

222
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 A lot of that material did come out in the late 1970s.

223
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 So I want to reference you to what they're trying to cover up, what they want to destroy.

224
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 If you look at Magnet report number one, which we found in the files of the guy who ran the Canadian government program,

225
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 you will see Project Magnet report.

226
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 I'll refer to you to page two.

227
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 At the top of page two it says, "This is an official report that sat on the Prime Minister's desk in Canada for three months,

228
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 according to the wife of the guy who wrote it.

229
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 It appears then that we are faced with a substantial probability of the real existence of extraterrestrial vehicles,

230
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 regardless of whether or not they fit into our scheme of things."

231
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 That was the official conclusion by the Canadian government report in 1952, which went to the Prime Minister.

232
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Let's go to top secret document number one.

233
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 This is the famous top secret memo that Stanton Freeman helped force out in 1978.

234
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 It was written in 1950, but it did not get declassified until 1978.

235
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 As a top secret document, the Canadian government does not deny this document.

236
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 It agrees that this is a legitimate document.

237
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 It was stamped top secret.

238
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 It was written by Wilbert B. Smith.

239
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 The background to it was the Canadians in 1950 had decided they were going to go to the Americans.

240
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 They were going to find out what the Americans knew about the flying saucer program.

241
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 They went down and through the military attache at the Canadian embassy,

242
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 and through the Canadian embassy they asked questions of the Americans, "Is this for real? What's going on?"

243
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 And here is the conclusion that went back to the Canadian government.

244
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 The subject is the most highly classified subject in the United States, rated higher than the hydrogen bomb.

245
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Flying saucers exist.

246
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Their modus operandi is unknown, but there's a small group headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush,

247
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 who is the science advisor to Roosevelt, that he's in charge of the program.

248
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 And the fourth thing was the entire matter is considered to be of tremendous significance.

249
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 And then the fifth point that he mentions, and this goes to Mr. Bartlett's question

250
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 about how did they get here from 37 light years away.

251
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 He said, "I was further informed that mental phenomena may be associated with the flying saucers

252
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 and that the Americans aren't doing very well because they've asked that if we're doing anything in Canada,

253
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 they're willing to exchange credentials and talk to us about it."

254
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 That's the top secret memo.

255
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Flying saucers exist.

256
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 What's happened in the last 50 years has been a circus.

257
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Can we go to the next document, which would be embassy document number four?

258
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 This is some of the documentation that was destroyed by the Canadian government.

259
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 It was recovered because Wilbur Smith had it in his personal files.

260
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 And I'll just read to you here.

261
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 This is the third secretary at the Canadian embassy writing to Wilbur Smith back in Canada.

262
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 He said, "We are, of course, have our eyes and ears open and if anything significant should happen,

263
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 you'll hear it through the right salient channel."

264
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 These are the military liaison people.

265
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 "At the instructions of the ambassador in the embassy, apart from Wright and myself,

266
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 nobody is to discuss the matter with anybody."

267
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 So the Canadians have been told.

268
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 And on the second page of that, which is embassy number four,

269
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 basically it says, "The ambassador and I would be particularly interested in any indication

270
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 that you may have heard of the possibility of an official statement."

271
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 The Canadians in 1950 were sitting.

272
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 They had heard that the Americans had a crash-flying saucer.

273
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 They had been told that this was for real.

274
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 And they were sitting there waiting for the Americans to make a statement.

275
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 So I'll just leave it at that.

276
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 And if there's any questions, we'll go from there.

277
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Thanks.

278
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Thank you very much.

279
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 Dr. Wood, I'm particularly interested in PhDs in physics from places like Cornell.

280
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 You're obviously a very intelligent person and someone not easily fooled.

281
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 There's no doubt in your mind that the documents that you've helped with, Mr. Friedman,

282
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 there's just no question.

283
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 And you've, I think, written a very credible statement here that these are authentic.

284
00:44:47,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 Okay, and as a very capable person, when the top page of the document file,

285
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 and the 28 pages you say were involved in this, and again, we're talking,

286
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 I think what I'm understanding is that what you've authenticated is the majestic 12,

287
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 which has been known as the majestic 12 stuff, which resulted in this particular.

288
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 If you could just clarify that for me if I've got that wrong.

289
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 Okay.

290
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 My son's website, www.majesticdocuments.com, has 64 documents in it.

291
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 This is one of the 64.

292
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 Oh, I see.

293
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 And basically it is a replication of the manual that was photographed on a 35-millimeter film.

294
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 So from those photographs, I was able to recreate something that would seem to be exactly what it would have been in 1954.

295
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 I understand. When the war office back in 1950, whatever, when the war office training manual is entitled,

296
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 "Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology Recovery and Disposal."

297
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 Correct.

298
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 That's what it says.

299
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 Right here.

300
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 And then you've got, and we've seen, yeah, okay. In your opinion, as a, as clearly as a smart man, that's all I have to say.

301
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 Does that mean the United States government at that time thought there was a high probability that there were,

302
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 there could be extraterrestrial involvement in the UFO phenomena that had been clearly observed up to that point?

303
00:46:47,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 We've got evidence of 36 and earlier and others, and Roswell materials and so forth that were recovered and something unidentified, unexplained?

304
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 Let me finish my question, if I could, Dr. Wood. Is that proof that the government at that time thought there was a high probability of extraterrestrial life involved,

305
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 or is that an indication that the government thought it was an absolute reality that extraterrestrial was involved?

306
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 Because wouldn't the government, with thinking that perhaps this is the best explanation, have to prepare documents to help researchers categorize

307
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 not necessarily things they had found specifically, but things that had been cited that other people had found that had been reported to them?

308
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 I'm just trying to understand the context of Majestic 12.

309
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 And I'm asking Dr. Wood, I'm going to get to you in a moment, as how. I can see you're eager to say something. Go ahead.

310
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 Well, I think the important point is that of the documents that I have, three of them basically cite crashes associated with the so-called Battle of LA in February 1942,

311
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 where one was recovered in the San Bernardino Mountains and one was salvaged by the Navy at sea. In addition to that, there was a crash.

312
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 They were wondering about the probability, weren't they, of whether it was ET, not the reality, that they had already come to that conclusion?

313
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 Well, my judgment is that they recovered these craft, and immediately they decided that it was very important,

314
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 because we were essentially in the war with Nazi Germany and Japan, to keep this secret.

315
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 And, of course, that would imply that they thought that maybe this was a Nazi maneuverable vehicle that may have been...

316
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 The documents...

317
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 Clearly at that time, there was a lot of respect for German and Russian and engineering on things.

318
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 There's a...

319
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 They couldn't, you know, they weren't exactly the same as what we had developed in the United States.

320
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 There's a double top-secret memo signed by FDR that alludes to non-terrestrial objects.

321
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 And so, clearly, the language they were using in the early '40s, before 1945, was non-terrestrial.

322
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 And so, clearly, the government felt there's...

323
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 It could even be that they felt it was the best explanation.

324
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 But do they have... In these documents, is there something that absolutely is not just a report of,

325
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 but an actual thing that they're saying is unquestionably of extraterrestrial origin?

326
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 That's what I'm asking you.

327
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 Well, they initiated a study called the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit that had a classification of top secret.

328
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 So, in my judgment, these early crashes were what triggered a process that is described in the 1954 document

329
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 as to how we would be able to go and retrieve crashed or shot down flying saucers and be able to study them.

330
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 We have probably at least a hundred different crash retrievals over the world.

331
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 Sure. In other words, Dr. Wood, one of the possible explanations, and I'm not leading anybody anywhere here.

332
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 I'm trying to understand it as best I can.

333
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 And I don't care where this leads. I want to know the truth.

334
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 That's what getting rid of a truth embargo is all about.

335
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 But anyway, what I'm asking is, wouldn't it be prudent?

336
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 As what I think is apparent in some of the Canadian memos I'm going to ask Mr. Cameron about,

337
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 that a government thinking that it might be the best explanation is going to set in procedures and even make descriptions,

338
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 not necessarily because the government people that are writing these memos had witnessed the craft that had the legs of this,

339
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 but they had received reports of crafts like this.

340
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 And so they were preparing as people, they were much more eager, it seems to me in those days, to go out and try to find evidence

341
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 of what they thought might be the best explanation.

342
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Now is that, I'm going to go to Mr. Cameron and say, is that consistent with this document that you look at?

343
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 And believe me, I want to commend everybody here that's been instrumental in getting some of these documents,

344
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 because we wouldn't have had these documents without the four of you all sitting here in front of us today.

345
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 And that's a great, great thing.

346
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 And in Canada, they're saying here in one of the memos you brought forth,

347
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 that many sightings undoubtedly are due to unusual views of common objects or phenomena and are quite normal,

348
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 but there are many sightings which cannot be explained so easily.

349
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 Now at the same time, they also say it appears then that we are faced with a substantial probability of the real existence of extraterrestrial vehicles.

350
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 Now, you know, as far as I'm concerned, if I were a member of Congress, which I was, if I were again,

351
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 I would say to you that if I felt there was a substantial probability of the real existence of extraterrestrial vehicles based on reports that had come in,

352
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 86,000 in this country alone, 62,000 that had enough umph to be highlighted here this morning,

353
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 witnesses, missile launch officers that saw things that caused the whole government to restructure some of their weapons systems,

354
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 I would absolutely demand a hearing.

355
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 But that still does not prove that they thought there were extraterrestrials.

356
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 And it does not prove from these documents that they were collecting materials that were in fact determined,

357
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 at least by the government, as being extraterrestrial at the time.

358
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 A high probability, I absolutely agree, these documents show that.

359
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 And that's, hey, that's enough for me to want to investigate very seriously with very credible witnesses as you all are.

360
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 And in the Congress of the United States, both the Senate and the House, I think it deserves that.

361
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 But I think, I just want to understand for sure if there's anything in the documents that you say is first source evidence of ET.

362
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 I'm asking both of you that, and then I'll, anything in the document that is.

363
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 I'm talking about not just, you know, citing, not just a report.

364
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 No, it wouldn't be in the official material that I have presented to you.

365
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 In private writings, he does say that, yes, in his private writings.

366
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 Who says that?

367
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 The guy who wrote the top secret memo, Wilbert B. Smith, who ran the Canadian government program from 1950 to 1954.

368
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 But why in his public, are you saying that, oh, the reason he described it as just a high probability in public is because.

369
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 Well, that's a preliminary report that was given to the Prime Minister of Canada in 1952.

370
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 Sure, but they're going to keep it secret.

371
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 He thought.

372
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 Pardon me?

373
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 Remember, he thought they were going to keep it secret.

374
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
 It was only good detective work of you all where it's not been kept private.

375
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
 But I mean, why wouldn't he express his honest, to goodness, opinion publicly if he thought it was, hey, it was very clear.

376
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 It was very clear from this cover letter they were going to keep it under wraps.

377
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 Well, because the document is that top secret.

378
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 It was all classified.

379
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 Sure.

380
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 And it was classified.

381
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 This document was forced out by Staten Friedman in 1978.

382
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 No, I understand.

383
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 It remained classified.

384
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 I've commended him for that.

385
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 And so there's a lot of stuff I'll talk about tomorrow behind the scenes of stuff that he was doing and the Canadians were doing that showed that they knew this was extraterrestrial.

386
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 But in the document, he does say the Americans say flying saucers exist.

387
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 It's simple.

388
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 Flying saucers exist.

389
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
 He went down there.

390
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 Tomorrow, I'll get into what he learned in the States and who was telling him what.

391
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 Okay, but in the documents you have here in front of us, it doesn't.

392
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 Or does it?

393
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 I'm not trying to get into any.

394
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 Yeah, no.

395
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 It does say flying saucers exist.

396
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 That's what they were told.

397
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 And I see my time is up.

398
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 Thank you very much for your answers.

399
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 I wish I could get out.

400
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
 I think you have something important to say and I hope we'll get it.

401
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 Thank you.

402
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
 And we'll come back to it.

403
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 Congresswoman Hooley.

404
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 Thank you, Mr. Chair.

405
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
 Again, anyone that would like to answer any of these questions would be great.

406
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 Have we, do we have other than what happened in Utah, do we have, or New Mexico, excuse

407
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 me, do we have any other vehicles, UFOs, whatever you want to call them, do we have any of those

408
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 that were crashed, shot down that we can examine?

409
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 You mean publicly?

410
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 Publicly.

411
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
 It's all classified.

412
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 That's the whole point of this thing, that the evidence that's available, the hard, you

413
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
 know, knock on the wheels, stuff is all classified.

414
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 That's the whole point of this thing, is that we don't have access.

415
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 And if you look, there's plenty of classified documents, Bob showed a good one.

416
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 We don't get access to that.

417
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 I don't have a need to know for any of that stuff.

418
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 People say, what was the analysis of the material at Roswell?

419
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 I'm not on any list for sending classified information about Roswell or Aztec or any of

420
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
 the other crashes.

421
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 So when you say, do we have, if you mean the public, no, we do not.

422
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 Are there bodies within governments, whether Canadian or American or Russian or English

423
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 or whatever, that have that information, it's pretty clear that they do.

424
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
 Went somewhere.

425
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
 We'll be talking about Roswell tomorrow.

426
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 Right.

427
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 And so we'll get into that.

428
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 And one postscript, this is not about a probability, sir, this is how the government wanted the

429
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 collection teams, which had names and numbers, to be how they would go out to retrieve craft,

430
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 how they would go out and retrieve bodies dead and alive.

431
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 The whole procedure of how to deal with it was written and published in this 1954.

432
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 And how to cover it up.

433
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 And how to cover it up.

434
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 And if I could add, my son has written a book called Magic Eyes Only, which describes 74

435
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
 different crash retrieval cases with an authenticity index for each one to give you the confidence

436
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 that you should have.

437
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
 And some of them are very highly confident.

438
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 Some of them are questionable.

439
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
 But we're talking about dozens of crashes that have been retrieved, all of which are

440
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 classified.

441
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 And the reports are merely from other people who have said, described the process of retrieving

442
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 them.

443
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
 Yes.

444
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 What Wilbur Smith said, the Canadian guy, he states quite openly in his writings that

445
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
 he handled a piece that was shot off a flying saucer in 1952 over Washington by the Navy.

446
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
 He maintained that.

447
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
 Near the end of his life, he was dying of cancer.

448
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 He knew people were trying to get him to talk.

449
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 We have a letter, I don't have it for publication, I have it, where he was asked about the crash

450
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 material.

451
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 And he said, the US has tons of it.

452
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
 And they also have a lot of film, and then he puts it in capital.

453
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 It is in official, not US Air Force hands.

454
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 So he was hinting to people that this is for real.

455
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 His son testified, he will testify, he's talked to me, he's talked to numerous people, that

456
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 his father told him shortly before his death that he did see a flying saucer and the bodies

457
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 outside of Washington, DC.

458
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
 And one of his associates also saw it.

459
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 I talked to his top metallurgist guy, because a lot of this material was going to Canada

460
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
 for analysis.

461
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 I talked to his metallurgist and I said, how much material did you and Wilbur handle?

462
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 He said, tons of it.

463
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 Again, thank you.

464
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 Has this, we've talked about this occurring, unidentified flying objects in England.

465
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 Is this a worldwide phenomena, or is it?

466
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 Yes.

467
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 Okay, thank you.

468
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
 And what do other countries do with the information they get?

469
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
 They usually pass it on to the United States.

470
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 There was a crash in Varginha, Brazil, which the word is that Americans took the wreckage

471
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
 and the bodies.

472
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 Yeah, the Secretary of State was there, Warren Christopher went there, and the deal supposedly

473
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 was that they were going to put a Brazilian on the space shuttle, and that's happened

474
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 shortly after they negotiated, supposedly, for the bodies and the craft.

475
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 Carrot and stick.

476
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
 Why do we want to keep quiet about this?

477
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
 I'll give you six quick reasons.

478
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
 All right.

479
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
 You want to figure out how, by we, everybody, you want to figure out how they work.

480
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 They make wonderful weapons delivery and defense systems.

481
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
 You've got wreckage.

482
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
 You set up your secret project.

483
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 Rule number one for security, you cannot tell your friends without telling your enemies.

484
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
 They read the newspapers, too.

485
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
 Right.

486
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 Second problem, what if the other guy figures out how they work from his wreckage before

487
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
 you do?

488
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 You don't want him to know.

489
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
 You know.

490
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 He knows.

491
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 Weapon, counter weapon, counter, counter weapon.

492
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 I've been playing this game a long time.

493
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
 The third problem is what if an announcement were to be made?

494
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 You picked the people trusted all over the planet, as I mentioned yesterday, you know,

495
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
 the Queen and the Pope saying that, indeed, some UFOs are aliens.

496
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
 What would happen?

497
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
 Are we ready to deal with the increase in mental hospital admissions, all kinds of things

498
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
 that would go on, church attendance would go up, I presume.

499
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
 The stock market would go down.

500
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
 Anything that rocks the boat, the stock market goes down.

501
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 Are we ready to deal with those?

502
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 And I think one thing that would happen is that the younger generation would push for

503
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 the very sensible notion of, hey, we're all earthlings.

504
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
 What are you talking, Canadians, Americans, Greeks, Peruvians?

505
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
 You know of any government that wants that?

506
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
 I don't.

507
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,000
 The United States government doesn't want people to think of themselves as planetarians,

508
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
 if you are Terrans.

509
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
 Nationalism is the only game in town on which the world operates at the moment.

510
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 Fourth, there are the distinct religious problems with people saying there is nobody out there.

511
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 It's the work of the devil.

512
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 I've been told this by certain religious people.

513
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 These things can't be real and there would be great distress if an announcement were to be made.

514
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 Fifth, people say if they're coming here and we're not going there, they're more advanced than we are.

515
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
 That means pretty soon we'll get rid of oil.

516
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 There goes that industry.

517
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
 We'll have better ground and air transportation.

518
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 There goes those industries.

519
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
 Some people would say maybe that's not a bad idea, but computers --

520
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
 I was going to say, I'd like a little faster airplane, but go ahead.

521
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 And finally, I have heard seven stories of American airplanes -- no, airplanes.

522
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:28,000
 One of them was Russian -- being destroyed by aliens chasing those aircraft.

523
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
 And the United States government does not want to release that.

524
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 It's a long habit.

525
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
 Bad things happen to people.

526
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
 You don't want the public to know.

527
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
 We shot down some Russian airplanes.

528
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
 No word in the newspapers about them approaching the coasts, if you will.

529
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
 It's been done.

530
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 So if we're going to disclose, we need to have a procedure established.

531
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 Okay, where do we go from here?

532
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 I think one thing would be to announce that there are going to be international conferences.

533
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:09,000
 International, dealing with the political, religious, technological, et cetera, implications here.

534
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
 It's a whole new world.

535
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
 Everything changes.

536
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 It's not just UFO buffs that have things changing.

537
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
 Thank you.

538
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
 Thank you, Congresswoman.

539
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 Congresswoman Kayle Patrick, please.

540
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
 Thank you very much.

541
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 I got one for you to come back.

542
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 Doctor, would you please define non-terrestrial for me, please?

543
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
 Non-terrestrial.

544
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 Well, I think the word non-terrestrial was selected in order to avoid having to say they were extraterrestrial

545
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,000
 because other possibilities would have been to come from the ocean or from beneath the surface of the Earth.

546
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 They just wanted to say they didn't know where they came from.

547
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
 Also, they could have come from some other place in time.

548
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:05,000
 There have been serious people who are, well, as was said earlier,

549
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
 mental processes may be important in this subject.

550
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 And included in those mental processes are reports where things are strange in time.

551
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:24,000
 In fact, I think I heard yesterday somebody said his watch was off, 25 minutes, 45 minutes.

552
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
 So I think they basically were being more careful than saying extraterrestrial.

553
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
 When they said non-terrestrial, they meant it could have come from beneath the Earth

554
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
 or could have come from some place in time.

555
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 And I think we still have that possibility that, in fact, the travel procedures to go from other stars to here

556
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
 may include some time travel.

557
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
 Is there another terrestrial, non and extra?

558
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 Is there another in between or is that the scientists use or whatever?

559
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:03,000
 Well, non-terrestrial just means not here on Earth with our present society.

560
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 Extraterrestrial means clearly from other stars.

561
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 So non-terrestrials, everything else is not extraterrestrial.

562
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
 Right.

563
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
 Ah, that's the first one.

564
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 Do you all agree, the other three, agree with that kind of definition?

565
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
 Remember that that was prepared before we'd been in space.

566
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 But this is 2013.

567
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
 I know that.

568
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 You mean the reports?

569
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
 Yes.

570
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
 54, and I'm going to pull them up as soon as I get up.

571
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 Yeah, 54 is before, and the British astronomer Royal in 1956 said space travel is utter bilge.

572
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 Right, right, right, and we know that to be true today, really.

573
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 Right, I mean, it's whatever you can't define.

574
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
 Really, it's what I'm kind of learning.

575
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
 Space travel is real.

576
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
 Absolutely real.

577
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 Planets and universes and extraterrestrials too, it sounds like.

578
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 People being in space was something that was not accepted by the astronomical community back when that was written.

579
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 Okay, but today we know that's not true because we ourselves.

580
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
 Yes.

581
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
 Okay, well that's good.

582
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
 Thank you, doctor.

583
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
 Appreciate that, doctor.

584
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 I was just trying to understand it my own self.

585
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 International conference.

586
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
 I'm glad you said it.

587
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
 That's kind of, I didn't say it like that.

588
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
 It needs to be an international answer to this.

589
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 And, Dr. Freeman, you were saying that all the other countries give their stuff to the U.S.

590
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
 Well, give, maybe they sell might be better.

591
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 Give their thinking, their materials, their, maybe not the aircraft that they hijacked or got.

592
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
 I'm coming there next because I wrote down aliens got, took over, you said the aircraft.

593
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 I don't know if it's U.S. aircraft.

594
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 Have aliens taken over any of our aircrafts?

595
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,000
 Oh, our airplanes chasing.

596
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
 We chase them.

597
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
 Do they chase us?

598
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
 They chase us.

599
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
 We don't seem to be able to get rid of them.

600
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
 They chase us.

601
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 And then when we go to chase them.

602
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
 You can't.

603
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
 They're too fast.

604
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
 They're too quiet.

605
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
 They move too quickly.

606
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 It would be important for them to find out how quickly we can fly so they graduate.

607
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
 You know already.

608
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 Well, it took a while at the beginning.

609
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
 How quickly we can fly, how maneuverable we are.

610
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:31,000
 It's very important in any military situation that you know the capabilities of your enemies.

611
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
 People, if they're attacking you, they're your enemies.

612
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 Do we know theirs?

613
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
 We know that they exceed ours.

614
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
 But the ultimate is I'm sure we don't know.

615
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
 And that's scary.

616
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
 Of course it's scary.

617
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 Yeah.

618
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
 So that's why I want the international conference.

619
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 That's why I want you all who are scientists in this for 30, 50, 60 years to pull something together.

620
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
 And one thing about Congress, we're good in three or four areas.

621
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
 Mine's defense and transportation.

622
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
 Somebody else's health and you know.

623
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 But the scientists don't let them.

624
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
 Someone said at this table either today or this morning I think.

625
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
 Scientists is what everything is based on.

626
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
 I mean this kind of matter.

627
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
 It's kind of subjects.

628
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
 We do it in our big science committee and several of these members served on it.

629
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
 Can I add something to that?

630
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
 Absolutely.

631
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 Based on what I've seen, the United States of America would block any such move.

632
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:31,000
 They already, as an example, the United Nations under Eric Gehry from Grenada tried to get a UN group to look at UFOs.

633
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
 And the evidence is pretty substantial that the Americans did everything they could to stonewall that.

634
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 And in that very discussion, Grenada was able to get two resolutions, who I still think are on the books in the UN, to do something.

635
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
 In the meantime, there was a coup and he was dethroned.

636
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
 But basically the end of the story was it never got in.

637
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
 I know.

638
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 The Americans were trying to block it.

639
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,000
 And that's the thing is that are the Americans ready to give up their power to a United Nations type group that's going to tell you what to do?

640
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
 You know, that's a -- shouldn't even answer that.

641
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
 Don't put us on a record.

642
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:09,000
 I mean, we know by what's happening in the world that that's not going to happen unless somewhere else internationally and things happen that moves to that.

643
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:19,000
 My whole thing as a grandmother is I want my grandchildren to have a world beyond the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years.

644
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 I'm a great grandfather.

645
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
 I agree with you.

646
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.

647
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
 I'm a great grandfather.

648
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
 I agree with you.

649
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
 Right, right, right.

650
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:37,000
 So it behooves all of the so-called humans and SSS who can come in here and wash their face and think who are not nearly as intelligent as the people we don't know about or the things or the beings or the presence.

651
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
 We've got some work to do.

652
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
 But I think you have to remember that -- and I think people sort of look at like good, evil.

653
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
 I still think that the people who are running the cover-up still want the best for their children and grandchildren.

654
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
 Absolutely.

655
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
 I just think they have a different opinion of what to do.

656
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
 I think everyone wants the best for their children and grandchildren.

657
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
 I wasn't separating that out.

658
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
 I think some want to keep it right here and not share the wealth.

659
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
 I think some are satisfied with a underclass and a top class.

660
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
 Because the idea I have is it's like we're in charge here.

661
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
 We know what to do.

662
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
 The rest of you just shut up and pay your taxes.

663
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
 But see, that's arrogant.

664
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
 And it's probably maybe true.

665
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
 But that's, I think, what the situation is.

666
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
 It's probably true.

667
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
 But that doesn't move us to plan B. That's all I'm saying.

668
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:26,000
 I think the whole thing is I'm feeling in the room and I love the people who follow this and have for many years because you have the scientific data.

669
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:32,000
 But we're going to have to get together on the how-to because you've got to meet people in not a combative way.

670
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
 It's got to be something that brings them in instead of shuts them out.

671
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
 And I think you go around the power structure to do that with the power structure included.

672
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
 And then I don't want to give up because I think it's too critical.

673
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
 The expert testimony and all the information you've given me for three days now is my mind is blown up.

674
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
 You know, somebody wants to ask me a question.

675
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
 I said I'm speaking on Friday when I get most of it and kind of sorted out.

676
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
 I don't know what to say right now.

677
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:07,000
 But to move it from a discussion like this that we're having to reality where people and countries get involved and begin to address it on scientific as well as other kind of ways, the others will come.

678
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
 They will.

679
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,000
 We take it out of that mystery spikehead yellow people kind of thing because it's way bigger than that.

680
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
 So, again, thank you for your what you do.

681
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:24,000
 We still have a lot of work to do.

682
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
 Let me turn to the congressman on my left.

683
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
 Thank you very much.

684
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
 Thank you all very much for your for your testimony.

685
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:46,000
 How many documents are publicly available of this type whose authenticity might be determined?

686
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:58,000
 How many are available thousands of the quality we have here where high ranking officials are admitting that there is something here that we ought to be looking at it.

687
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
 How many of those kinds of documents are available?

688
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
 Very few.

689
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
 That's what they're protecting.

690
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
 They're protecting the internal correspondence.

691
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
 I'm reading some of them here.

692
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
 Yeah.

693
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
 But that's from the guy's personal files and one that leaked out that they should have destroyed that they didn't destroy.

694
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
 Stanton forced it out.

695
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
 They released it.

696
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
 And I think they released it by accident.

697
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
 That top secret memo, I think, was supposed to have been destroyed.

698
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
 That's what I'm saying.

699
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
 You will not find the internal correspondence.

700
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
 What is the president saying about this?

701
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
 What is the Joint Chiefs of Staff doing?

702
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
 That kind of stuff is the stuff they're protecting.

703
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
 That's the stuff they're going to go to the grave fighting for to keep out of the public.

704
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
 They will give you the siting files because who cares?

705
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
 Someone saw something in the sky.

706
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
 That doesn't threaten them.

707
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:48,000
 But the correspondence as to what are they doing about it and what does the president and the top people who are in charge, what are they doing about it?

708
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
 That's the kind of stuff that they don't want you to know about.

709
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:59,000
 And that's what they refer to in there, the internal correspondence, which at no time should be made available to the public and should be destroyed.

710
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:06,000
 And one of the most important leaks is the SOM 101 document because it has held up over time.

711
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
 But remember, the origin of it was on 35 millimeter negative film.

712
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
 It was a leak.

713
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
 That's how we got this.

714
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,000
 I would say that all of the top secret documents have resulted from leaks from personal files.

715
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:31,000
 Well, with one exception, the NSA has released 156 top secret Umbra UFO documents.

716
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
 The only trouble is that it's all whited out.

717
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
 They didn't really release anything.

718
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
 They redacted, huh?

719
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
 Redacted is a kind way to put it.

720
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:48,000
 The CIA has released dozens of top secret Umbra UFO documents by their definition.

721
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
 And you can read five or six words per page, sometimes 12.

722
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
 Fast reading.

723
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
 So these are all old stuff.

724
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
 That's all pre 1980.

725
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
 And yet there are people saying there has been no cover up.

726
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
 I have people tell me, Stan, the NSA is giving us what they have.

727
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
 I say, can you read what's underneath the whiteout?

728
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
 Well, no, but one sentence per page is not enough.

729
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:34,000
 The documents on my son's website have 27 documents before 1948, 15 before 1960, and 11 from 1968, I think, and 11 more up to 2000.

730
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
 So a lot of them are very old.

731
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
 Are there any recent ones?

732
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
 The latest one I have is 2001.

733
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
 2001.

734
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
 Yeah.

735
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:56,000
 I've been exploring how we might get this issue out of the shadows of the lunatic fringe.

736
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:08,000
 And it occurred to me that one way might be to -- there's a lot of science and so forth involved with these reports of flying saucers.

737
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:15,000
 And a lot of ways to -- and the Air Force found ways to discredit almost 12,000 of those.

738
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,000
 They allowed that only 701 they couldn't account for.

739
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
 But when you come to the authenticity of documents, that's something almost everybody can relate to.

740
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
 It's either real or it's not real.

741
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:49,000
 And if there are real documents where people of high levels suggested that there might be non-terrestrial, extraterrestrial, whatever it is, activities associated with this,

742
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
 if that got into the public, I would think that that would be a wedge.

743
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
 Gee, these people thought there was something there.

744
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
 What were they looking at that they thought there was something there?

745
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:17,000
 If you were in a court and a question of the authenticity of a document came up and you were looking for a source that would be acceptable both to the prosecution and the defense,

746
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:25,000
 an honest broker that both sides would agree with, who would that be?

747
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
 The question is who would --

748
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:36,000
 Well, let me ask this question the way we would ask it in a hearing in the -- I know some of these things you can't do immediately, so we'd ask you to provide for the record.

749
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:44,000
 That's a little different here, but if you would think about what this would be, I'd be very interested in knowing who that honest broker would be,

750
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:54,000
 that both the defense and the prosecution would agree was an expert whose judgment could be relied on.

751
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:03,000
 One answer I can give you is the procedure that I used was to go to an expert whose name was James Black with respect to typewriter fonts.

752
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:13,000
 That's the kind of thing I'm talking about, but some organization like the FBI crime lab, but there must be some private entity out there that does this kind of thing.

753
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
 I've hired them to study some of the other documents to determine the age of the ink.

754
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
 Yep, lots of things you can look at.

755
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,000
 If you have the original document, the chemistry of the paper, there are a lot of things you can look at to determine authenticity of this.

756
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
 We have three documents with the original name.

757
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
 Okay.

758
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:41,000
 The next thing, if there are documents whose authenticity would convince people that, gee, we really need to look at what they were looking at to say that, then what would be --

759
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
 and again, think about this and get back to us.

760
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:57,000
 What would be a vehicle that would be both agreeable and acceptable to the general public for doing this?

761
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:08,000
 So now we're looking for an organization, some entity that is an honest broker who everybody would agree, gee, you can count on their credibility in authenticating these documents.

762
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:22,000
 And then we need some entity to get this in the public domain who has the courage to do it, who has the credibility to be acceptable to the general public.

763
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:29,000
 If we can do this, maybe we can get this out of the shadows, as I say, of the lunatic fringe, which is where it is now.

764
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
 You can see that from the press things.

765
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
 That's what people think about it.

766
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
 That's what the press thinks about it.

767
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
 Yeah.

768
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
 That's something different from what the people think about it.

769
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
 Yeah, I don't know.

770
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
 What do polls show?

771
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
 I haven't seen any polls on this.

772
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
 There are more believers than nonbelievers.

773
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
 Oh, really?

774
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
 Yes.

775
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
 Okay, okay.

776
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:55,000
 By the way, 15 percent favorable rating for Congress is pretty high.

777
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
 It's more like 9 percent, and I'm looking for those 9 percent.

778
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
 Thank you for that challenging question.

779
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,000
 You're talking about true humility.

780
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
 Well, I've got two minutes, so I can ask a question.

781
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
 But I want to associate myself with the remarks of Congresswoman Woolsey.

782
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:25,000
 And I know that Congressman Hoolie and I had a private discussion on the same subject, and the Congressman here has just touched upon it.

783
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
 What is the next step?

784
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
 Well, the next step is not going to be Congress.

785
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
 I just do not think that's going to happen, period.

786
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:43,000
 But there's an idea, a thought that came up one the other day, and it complements with what I think Mr. Cameron was bringing up.

787
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
 And that is the next step, and this is a great first step.

788
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
 Make no mistake about it.

789
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
 I'm not trying to minimize the progress that we're making here.

790
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:04,000
 But an international conference not made up of the lunatic fringe of opponents or the lunatic fringe of proponents,

791
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:13,000
 but an international conference hopefully under the auspices of the United Nations so it's global in its character.

792
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:20,000
 And so I would hope that the lobbying would take place within the United States with or without the United States' involvement.

793
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
 You could get it through the General Assembly.

794
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:28,000
 Now, clearly you won't get it through the Security Council because we control the Security Council, and that's a hoax.

795
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:37,000
 But you could go to the General Assembly, and you could try to get -- and since there is such apparently a body

796
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:46,000
 within South America that has some interest in this, you could get it passed through the General Assembly, creating a commission.

797
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,000
 And the beginning work of the commission would be to have an international conference.

798
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
 So it would be a conference, not a hearing like this,

799
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:03,000
 but it truly would be a conference with an agenda to provide -- get papers forward, to have the analysis.

800
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:12,000
 And that would -- and then, of course, to have the economic wherewithal to video stream it in all the pertinent languages,

801
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:21,000
 and automatic for the United Nations. I think that that would be the next step because we're frozen.

802
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,000
 And, of course, this is my own thinking, and I don't want to say that the others are associated with these remarks.

803
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:35,000
 I have lost faith in representative government. I truly think we're in gridlock. It doesn't work.

804
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
 And so we need to make a change. What that change will be --

805
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
 [applause]

806
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
 You can only make changes with power. You have to have power to make a change.

807
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:53,000
 We don't have the power here. We have the power so that it gets to the media, and so that's the step forward.

808
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:01,000
 Now, we hope that those who have funded this will think in terms of funding and effort to get the UN to get involved

809
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:11,000
 and to fund either privately or publicly an international conference. And so where will that take us?

810
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:17,000
 That will take us to a further realization that the answer is with the people.

811
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:27,000
 There's only two venues for change or the exercise of power. One is the government, wherein the problem lies, or the people.

812
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:34,000
 The government won't, but the people are not equipped to do that under our present structure of human governance.

813
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:42,000
 So let me leave it at that and say that we will have an hour -- a little less than an hour for lunch.

814
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:52,000
 And we will be back here at 1.45, and promptly at 1.45 we'll begin, and we look forward to --

815
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,000
 This afternoon I think we're dealing with Roswell, and that, of course, commands a lot of attention.

816
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
 Thank you all.
