1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,760
 If you prefer sitting is fine and just repeat after me.

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,260
 I do hereby affirm.

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,200
 I do hereby affirm.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,700
 That I will tell the truth.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,440
 That I will tell the truth.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,800
 And nothing but the truth.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,160
 And nothing but the truth.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,640
 To this committee today.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
 Thank you, sir.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,480
 Mr. Chair, I believe we're ready to begin.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,800
 We're reconvening the hearing and we have a new witness and we're going to start questioning

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,960
 from going this direction, taking testimony.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,800
 Since we've heard testimony from the other individuals, I think we might open it up between

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,680
 a Q&A between the members and yourselves because I think it generates focused information for

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
 the hearing.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,520
 And not necessarily because we're so bright but it's because the combination, the synergy

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,040
 of the two can be very effective.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,040
 Colonel French, did we have testimony from you the other day or is this the first time

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
 you have appeared?

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,600
 No, this is my second appearance.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
 That's what I thought.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,960
 I thought I remembered you and I was impressed the last time.

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,000
 Colonel French, the floor is yours and give us testimony.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,160
 I am Lieutenant Colonel Richard French, United States Air Force retired.

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,480
 I'm also a PhD.

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:40,240
 I was assigned to the 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron in Alexandria, Louisiana at England

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,840
 Air Force Base.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:51,840
 I was sent to Alamogordo, New Mexico to accomplish my annual refresher course in the altitude

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
 chamber.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,800
 While there I learned of an accident a few miles away from Alamogordo in the direction

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:17,640
 of the White Sands, a short time later I witnessed the takeoff of a prototype of a fighter aircraft

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:26,280
 that I either recognized or knew, had no idea what it was.

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,020
 Anyway the aircraft took off at a very high rate of speed and fired a rocket.

34
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:41,200
 The rocket was basically five inches in diameter and about six feet long, about the same size

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:52,080
 as some of the modern anti-aircraft aerial rockets, I mean air-to-air aerial rockets.

36
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:05,880
 Afterward I was asked to review some of the items that were picked up from the crash site.

37
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:13,920
 There was no unknown, there was an unknown number of humanoids either killed or injured.

38
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:24,260
 The parts of the casualties were taken to base operations at Holloman Air Force Base.

39
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:33,400
 The only parts of the craft that I was allowed to see had markings that appeared to be Arabic

40
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 or some language I didn't understand.

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,000
 Later I learned the parts and the casualties were transported to Wright Patterson Air Force

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,800
 Base and turned over the Foreign Technology Division under which is run by Colonel Paul

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:06,360
 Sleeper. Because I had left the Office of Special Investigations, I did not do any kind

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:16,080
 of formal report as I had been reassigned to the Pacific Air Forces at Tongnyeongchon,

45
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:27,840
 which is in Korea. For that reason, I went out of the business.

46
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:36,580
 I have quite an experience of seeing UFOs. The reason for that, very simply, is this.

47
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:46,440
 When I was originally in the OSI, the very first of it, there are very common appearance

48
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:54,300
 at a place called Gulf Breeze, Florida. Is that familiar to you, that location? The reason

49
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,540
 I say that is on virtually any evening you can go out there and you'll see them come

50
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:10,640
 in and land or take off. We used to report that what they were were swamp gas, very frankly.

51
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:20,140
 It was one of those things. Of course it was a lie, but I was required to lie. That concludes

52
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,260
 my statement.

53
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,800
 Thank you. We'll proceed into, unless there's any of the others that want to give quick

54
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,880
 testimony because we've already heard your warns, we'll proceed to a Q&A and to a dialogue.

55
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,840
 Unless there's anybody that has something that's burning in their heart that they want

56
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:46,400
 to tell, or can we engage in a dialogue? We'll start with the congressman from Utah, please.

57
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,040
 Ten minutes, Mr. Chair. We'll have ten minutes.

58
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:00,880
 We'll have ten minutes? Don't tell them ten minutes. They'll take ten.

59
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,520
 That'll take us to five o'clock.

60
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:12,800
 Colonel French, this is really something that you've just said here that's very important.

61
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,320
 It's highly significant. I hadn't known until I read this and listened to you just now exactly

62
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,680
 what you are saying. I'm going to ask you just some specific questions. I want to start

63
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,360
 by saying I commend you for all the service you've given our country in uniform and for

64
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,080
 the things you've done that way. This is such a significant statement that I'm going to

65
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,880
 ask some rather specific questions if that's all right. Can you remember about when in

66
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:53,360
 the late '60s this event occurred? As close as you can. I mean, that's fine. It was just

67
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,760
 late '60s. If you know something a little more I'd be most interested.

68
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,920
 Well about when was it that you said it had to do with training in the late '60s that

69
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,720
 you were sent to Alamogordo?

70
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 Yeah.

71
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:16,080
 Okay, that's good enough. You learned of the accident a few miles away from Alamogordo.

72
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,000
 When did you learn of that accident? I mean, was it right at the time of the accident or

73
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,160
 was it later? Give me a little time frame here.

74
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,200
 Well, it was within a matter of hours.

75
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
 Oh, the same day.

76
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
 Yeah, oh yes.

77
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,840
 Okay, I just want to make sure I understood that. Because I would fix this to say the

78
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:48,280
 same day. That's significant. Okay, you witnessed the takeoff of the prototype to the fighter

79
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:58,400
 aircraft that actually engaged that unidentified object that was flying up there.

80
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
 Yes.

81
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,920
 Afterwards, you were asked to review some of the items. Now, this is the afterwards

82
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:11,280
 I'm really interested in. When afterwards were you asked to review some of the items

83
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,960
 that were picked up from the crash site?

84
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,760
 Ones that I've been told about.

85
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,760
 Oh, just a minute. Well, this statement, it says a short time later, I witnessed -- no,

86
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,800
 no, no, excuse me. Afterwards, I was asked to review some of the items that were picked

87
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,200
 up from the crash site. There were an unknown number of humanoids, either killed or injured.

88
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,760
 Did you see those?

89
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,400
 No, I didn't see them. I said that I was told about them.

90
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,520
 Oh, okay. Okay, and I understand that. And that's just fine. I just want to know exactly

91
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:54,320
 what happened here. The way this reads, I was wondering if you might have seen them

92
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
 yourself.

93
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
 No.

94
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
 You did not?

95
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,280
 As I said, I had seen a lot of UFOs under other circumstances, but not at that time.

96
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
 No, that doesn't apply.

97
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,320
 Okay, you reviewed items. And what were the items that you reviewed that were picked up

98
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,800
 that made you believe -- well, explain then how -- well, how did you hear about the humanoids?

99
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 Let me ask it that way.

100
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,440
 I was told that that was what was found.

101
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,440
 By who?

102
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
 People who were there.

103
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
 The --

104
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
 Air Force people?

105
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:40,680
 Yeah, well, there were people who were enlisted people and various people who were there standing

106
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,240
 on the ramp.

107
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,920
 Oh, that were picking up --

108
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,240
 No, I don't know what they were doing, but I say that there were -- needless to say,

109
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,040
 there was a lot of gossip and a lot of things going on that I was not a party to.

110
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,880
 Okay, so essentially you were told on that same day of the crash that there were an unknown

111
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,080
 number of humanoids either killed or injured?

112
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
 Yeah.

113
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:14,400
 Okay. Did you see or did somebody just tell you that the parts and casualties were taken

114
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
 to base operations?

115
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,400
 I don't know. For instance, one of the people that I saw that I -- a certain would have

116
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:31,320
 seen it happened to be a nurse that was in uniform. It was in uniform at the time.

117
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
 She told you right then?

118
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,120
 No, no. I say she would have known, but she wouldn't talk to me.

119
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,120
 Oh, okay. Well, you could only find out something if somebody either tells you or shows you

120
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
 --

121
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,800
 I had a natural curiosity as to what was happening, but they were very closed-mouthed, very secretive

122
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,400
 about everything.

123
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:03,880
 Okay. And you had learned that parts and casualties were transported to Wright-Patterson Air Force

124
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:11,480
 base. Again, I'd be most interested to know where you learned that or how you learned

125
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,720
 it or the circumstances of learning it.

126
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:26,400
 Well, later on, I had a very close friend who was a full colonel and who happened -- Paul

127
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,480
 Sleeper was a very good friend of his. And he and I discussed that a little bit, and

128
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:40,320
 he said, "Yes, that's where the parts went." He was a full colonel, Dr. George Kristof.

129
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,840
 Dr. George Kristof told you that?

130
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
 Yes.

131
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,000
 At that same time, essentially? That same year, at least?

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,640
 Well, it's later, but I don't remember exactly how much later.

133
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:00,840
 Okay. Maybe after he had been through with his whatever non-disclosure he had to take

134
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:09,720
 care of. Okay. Well, let me just turn back a little bit to Stanton Friedman and anybody

135
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:19,760
 that might want to answer any of these questions. What evidence do we have since '47, certainly

136
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,360
 in the '60s or at the time of this Alan McGorgor incident or anything of -- what is the evidence

137
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,000
 that we have that's as solid as we have? What is the most solid evidence of the humanoid

138
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 parts and so on that somebody told Colonel French about? Can we get to a direct person

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,960
 that might have said something either to Colonel French or anybody else about Alan McGorgor

140
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,960
 or anything that has to do with humanoids? Let's get into that. I want to know the best

141
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,080
 evidence there is out there today.

142
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,640
 We've got lots of good abduction stories.

143
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,080
 Now, you know, there might be things being withheld. That's not -- you know, and I understand

144
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,600
 all that. I just want to know -- and that might be the fault of the Army. That might

145
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:11,480
 be why we don't know. But I'm interested in what we absolutely do know about humanoids,

146
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,840
 even if --

147
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,160
 Testimony from people who have been abducted is as close as you get. I mean --

148
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,840
 Well, who's saying that? Okay. Well, give me the names.

149
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,340
 There's a book out there captured, "The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience." It's about

150
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,680
 two people who were abducted. They were carefully investigated by Dr. Benjamin Simon, a psychiatrist

151
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:41,880
 who ran a hospital for 3,000 shell shock war veterans. He says the emotional upheaval in

152
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,640
 their voices as he had 10 sessions with each of them was as strong as that in any of the

153
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:54,360
 war veterans that he had dealt with with PTSD. He's in the Army movie about PTSD. He knows

154
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:02,920
 that field, doesn't know flying saucers. And they saw -- they were close, intimately close

155
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,760
 to humanoids, to occupants from a vehicle from up there.

156
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,700
 Okay. Mr. Freeman, what are the names of those people that said they were abducted and then

157
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,280
 obviously came back to explain about that?

158
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,640
 Betty -- their names were Betty and Barney Hill, a couple in New Hampshire. The book

159
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,820
 is captured, "The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience," by myself. And the woman who

160
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,800
 did most of the work was Kathleen Martin, who's Betty's niece. She has the hypnosis

161
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,560
 tapes. It's a long story, an involved story, but one of the best ones around in terms of

162
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,640
 the quality of the people. Betty was a social worker.

163
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,520
 Okay. And we can follow up and even read the book and so on. What other examples do we

164
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
 have?

165
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,080
 In keeping with the Roswell theme, as we've talked about, the rancher, Mack Brazel --

166
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
 What year?

167
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
 Yes, 1947.

168
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
 Yeah, okay, thank you.

169
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,680
 1947, time of the incident. When the rancher first reported the fine to Sheriff George

170
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
 Wilcox --

171
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
 And the rancher --

172
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:16,000
 William W. W. Mack Brazel, Sheriff George Wilcox, and a reporter by the name of Frank

173
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,960
 Joyce from radio station KGFL, placed a phone call to get some late breaking news for his

174
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:29,040
 next report. And the sheriff said, "I think there's someone here you should speak with."

175
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,040
 And according to Joyce, he didn't get the name of the individual on the other line,

176
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,680
 but at first he was quite angry. He was upset about the fact, as described earlier, that

177
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,520
 he had to drive the sheep a couple of miles around all this wreckage. Who was responsible?

178
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,760
 Who was going to come and clean it all up? I'm the supervisor and everything. And then

179
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,400
 it became more and more somber, and he started talking about it was horrible. It was horrible.

180
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,860
 You wouldn't believe it. And Joyce finally, "What are you talking about? Something else?"

181
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:06,240
 To which he then would suggest, "Are you talking about bodies?" To which Joyce then

182
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,580
 suggested, "Well, you know they're launching those rockets over at White Sands. Maybe they've

183
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:17,040
 launched an animal. Maybe they're sending monkeys up in those rockets." To which Brazl

184
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,880
 fired back, "They weren't any monkeys. They weren't human. They weren't human. They weren't

185
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:31,400
 human. They weren't human." Since then, Brazl's own granddaughter, Fawn Fritz, has described

186
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:38,000
 to us that she overheard her grandfather also make the remark about the poor, unfortunate

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 creatures. We've also talked to young ranch boys at that time, Dee Proctor and Sidney

188
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,840
 Jack Wright, who were supposedly with Brazl when he would discover a couple of bodies

189
00:16:52,840 --> 00:17:02,440
 a few miles from the debris field at another location, another location, at Frankie Row.

190
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,160
 And so that you're saying that they did talk about it right at that time? Yes, yes. Oh,

191
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,720
 okay. That's a little different than what you said. Well, because it could take up a

192
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,880
 whole panel. I've already gone over my time, but I'm most interested. I was just going

193
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,760
 to say what you seem to be asking me was, "Do we have any contemporary records from

194
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,880
 that time?" Somebody wrote in their diary, "I saw bodies." If you want to talk about

195
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,960
 people who saw the bodies in 1947, yeah, we can give you lots of names. That's all I wanted

196
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,800
 is people that said it at the time, and nobody questions they said it at the time. And you

197
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,880
 had said, "Well, we've got them saying it later." And I just wanted to clarify this.

198
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:49,040
 Is it clarified? Yes. Because as I pointed out, Major Marcel, the father of Colonel Marcel,

199
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,000
 said it at the time, and it became well known at the time. That's what I'm looking for,

200
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,520
 something that was said at the time on a humanoid or some kind of a life form or something associated

201
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,600
 with one of these sightings. Could I take a minute? Please. Wow. It's up to the chair.

202
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:15,360
 Thank you. We had mentioned Frankie Rowe. Her father was a firefighter with the Roswell

203
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,080
 Fire Department. His name was Dan Dwyer. And the Fire Department adjoined the courthouse

204
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,920
 at that time. There was one phone line that ran into both. You couldn't report an incident

205
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,080
 to one without both hearing about it. So there was the report of a crash north of town. There

206
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,240
 was a talk about something that had gone down north of town. And the Fire Department investigated

207
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,840
 it. They went to check it out. According to Frankie Rowe, who was still alive, that when

208
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,440
 her father returned, the military already was securing the site, but that he described

209
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:57,360
 that they had seen the bodies. And it was later, whether it was that evening or shortly

210
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,280
 thereafter, they were visited by the military, by a military officer and a number of other

211
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,000
 MPs. And they were very sternly warned about not talking about this.

212
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,360
 Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to hear from, again, any one of you that want to talk about

213
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:30,860
 this. What are the things that you were -- I'd like to know what you wanted to say in this

214
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:38,880
 panel that you didn't say on the first panel. So Mr. Colonel Marcel, do you want to talk

215
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,440
 about what -- anything that you want to talk about that you didn't talk about on the first

216
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,220
 panel? Well, I just have formed a lot of opinions

217
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:58,760
 about UFOs and extraterrestrial visitations. And what I'd like to emphasize is the fact

218
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,800
 that the universe is such a large place. There's 10 to 20 second-power stars, which is about

219
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:11,720
 the number of grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. And just to say that one -- if they

220
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,560
 represent all the stars, there are all the grains of sand on the beach, if you only say

221
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,320
 that one has life around it like us and the rest of them are devoid of life, then I think

222
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,640
 we're sadly mistaken. Because the enormous possibilities of all life is everywhere, everywhere.

223
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:38,240
 Thank you. Colonel Watt-Randall, anything you want to add that you didn't say earlier?

224
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,560
 One of the things that I wanted to kind of talk about, which I think diverts us a tad

225
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,080
 bit, is this Project Mogul nonsense. And the Air Force explanation that Project Mogul explains

226
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,560
 it all, that Project Mogul was highly classified, and that's why the officers at Roswell were

227
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,360
 unable to identify the wreckage when they saw it. But it turns out Project Mogul was

228
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,320
 -- although it was highly classified, the purpose, the equipment and the experiments

229
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,080
 being carried out in New Mexico was not classified. They were mentioned in the newspaper on July

230
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,200
 10th as an explanation for what was found at Roswell. Charles Moore, who was the -- one

231
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,720
 of the scientists on Project Mogul, had said that it was so highly classified, they didn't

232
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,760
 even know the name. Yet, if you review Dr. Crary's diary from 1947, what you see is the

233
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,400
 name Mogul appearing periodically in it. The Air Forces used this as the cover. They said

234
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,800
 originally in 1947 it was a weather balloon. Then they said, well, we lied about that,

235
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,000
 it wasn't a weather balloon. And then they gave us another one, another weather balloon

236
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,360
 as an explanation. And that seems to have set in now after the last 10 years with the

237
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,200
 media that, well, Roswell's explained as a weather balloon. And the answer is they can't

238
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:56,040
 even point to a flight of these balloons that have not been identified as such. So the Project

239
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:02,440
 Mogul explanation simply doesn't work. We looked at -- and I say we, Don and Stan and

240
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,960
 I have looked for alternative explanations for the Roswell case. We went to White Sands

241
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,400
 Missile Range to see if there was a missile launch that would account for the debris found

242
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,800
 on the Brazel Ranch. We went to the archives in Alamogordo on the space program to see

243
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:26,520
 if they were launching any kind of creatures, whether they were mice or mayflies or chimpanzees

244
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,520
 that would account for the wreckage. And we could find absolutely nothing. I had always

245
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,640
 said if we could find an explanation for this -- maybe they had tested an astronaut in 1947

246
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,880
 and he was killed in the test. And if we could find something like that, we could write best-selling

247
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,760
 books about it and make a lot of money. But we could find nothing that explains the Roswell

248
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,600
 wreckage when you account for all the testimony, all the people who were involved, what they

249
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,000
 told us, the limited documentation we have. But when you look at all of that together,

250
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,800
 none of the explanations offered explains it in terrestrial terms.

251
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,560
 Yes, Mr. Friedman.

252
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,360
 Another point that should be made is that I contacted somebody who looked at the newspaper

253
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,880
 in Alamogordo, which is right next to Holloman Air Force Base. And it turns out they staged

254
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,400
 the launch of a radar-reflector-weather-balloon combination --

255
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,360
 On July 10th.

256
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:30,680
 The newspaper, July 10th. And fantasy of flying disk explained here was the headline. And

257
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,440
 they showed a picture of one of these balloon trains. And it just doesn't fit. If you look

258
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,840
 at the facts about what they launched and what was observed, they don't match. They

259
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:50,600
 don't match at all. But the fact that they went to the trouble of staging a launch tells

260
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,960
 you something. It was very important. Why bother? If it's just a dumb old weather balloon,

261
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,760
 who cares? It makes no sense. So they went to a lot of trouble to try to cover it up.

262
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:14,000
 And when Cavett, the CIC man, comes up with this real crazy story that he knew it was

263
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,480
 a balloon right away, it only covered an area 20 feet in diameter, even though the newspaper

264
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:29,760
 said 200, mind you, fit in one car, nothing to it. If that's all there had been, the rancher

265
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,440
 would have brought in his wreckage and his little truck.

266
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
 Right.

267
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,520
 And there would have been no reason for Jesse Marcel and Captain Cavett to follow them all

268
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,560
 the way out in the middle of nowhere. There's a lot of nowhere in New Mexico.

269
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,160
 Right. Which is...

270
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:52,280
 And they stayed overnight, had their sleeping bags. That's making a big deal about nothing

271
00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:00,680
 when Cavett lies and says it would fit in one vehicle, 20 feet square. But the New York

272
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:07,560
 Times didn't comment about it. Everybody carried that explanation. So one of the things we're

273
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:14,680
 dealing with here is a failure of the press to ask even the obvious questions. You know,

274
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:21,360
 the colonel, the head of the 509th can't identify a weather balloon? These guys had fought in

275
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,440
 the Pacific. They weren't right off the training base. Jesse Marcel couldn't identify a weather

276
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:37,080
 balloon. They got away with it. But this is in the '90s, mind you. So the press is still

277
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
 not doing its job.

278
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,800
 I can understand in '47, we just fought a great war. You know, you believe the government...

279
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,240
 Didn't everybody believe the government back then? But in '97, that they could get away

280
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:58,200
 with this, it really bugs me. And a little inside story. I'm waiting. They have reissued,

281
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:05,120
 Cosimo Publishers has reissued those two volumes of the Roswell Report. The second one was

282
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,280
 case closed. The first one said they were not going to say anything more. Three years

283
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,780
 later, this is the second one. On the top, it says, "With the new introduction by nuclear

284
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:21,360
 physicist Stanton Friedman, author of Crash and Corona, the definitive study, the Roswell

285
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,200
 Incident." I'm waiting for somebody in the Air Force, because my comments are very strong,

286
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,680
 about lies by the Air Force, about in this report. I'm waiting for somebody to say, "Hey,

287
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,120
 look what he said about us. If I don't make it home, you'll know why."

288
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:49,640
 In keeping, as far as even on the CIC, on the Sheridan-Cavett theme, as Kevin remembers

289
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,720
 the numerous times that we actually sat down and met with then Lieutenant Colonel Sheridan

290
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,120
 Cavett, he and his wife, Mary, whether in their home up in the Squam, Washington, or

291
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,540
 their winter home on Sierra Vista, yes. Yeah, he retired Lieutenant Colonel. And the very

292
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:14,360
 first meeting, how we spent the better part of an afternoon, his denying he was even there,

293
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,880
 that he had yet to even arrive at Roswell. Didn't matter. You're talking about someone

294
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,320
 else, someone who was there before me. And as we were leaving, he walked us out to the

295
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,600
 car and he says to us, "Boys, I need to know one thing. Should you find anything that should

296
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,000
 threaten national security, you will keep it to yourselves, won't you?" And we looked

297
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,400
 at one another and, "Yes, Colonel, of course, of course." And we got in the car and we looked

298
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:49,600
 at one another and said, "He knows. He knows." And then as we would visit and press more

299
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,020
 and more and we'd speak with him over the phone and demonstrate not only was he there,

300
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,760
 but he was involved and to the point that, "Well, I went out there, but it wasn't really

301
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,120
 anything." Well, at one point he even said, "Well, it could have been a flying saucer,

302
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,080
 but I wasn't involved," that type of thing. The very last time we met with him and he

303
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,880
 and his wife were outside at the car and I said to him, "Colonel, I really have to hand

304
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,000
 it to you. You've been a man who's kept your oath all these years. You're a true patriot."

305
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,760
 And he thanked me and I said, "But, Colonel, what gives you the right withholding it from

306
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,200
 my generation, all of us who weren't even there in 1947? You've decided for all of us."

307
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,360
 And he paused for a moment and he says, "I've never thought of it that way before, but I'm

308
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,600
 still not going to tell you anything." And then his wife, Mary, blurts out, "Tell the

309
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,760
 boys about the colonel from the Pentagon who was just here to talk with you." And he turns

310
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:57,720
 and gives her this look, this searing look, and it was Colonel Richard Weaver in preparation

311
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:06,680
 of the Project Mogul Report, to which Colonel Kev had become their lone star witness. And

312
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,920
 he snaps at us and, "Yes, and I told him exactly what I'm telling you. I wasn't involved."

313
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,800
 Well, that's not what's in the Project Mogul Report, according to what he told Colonel

314
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:24,720
 Weaver. He was the one who immediately identified it as nothing more than this mogul balloon,

315
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,640
 and in fact, he kept it to himself. He didn't even bother telling the base commander or

316
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,880
 Major Marcel, but that he saw that it was nothing more than a weather balloon. So we

317
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:46,400
 caught him in a flat lie. He nonetheless is the only witness to this being a mogul balloon.

318
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:54,120
 But as he told us, as he said, as I told Colonel Weaver, "I wasn't involved." So who should

319
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
 we believe?

320
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,120
 And in fact, we have Colonel Kavett on tape. It was right after Weaver had seen him, and

321
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,000
 he was talking about how he wasn't there. We said, "Well, they talk about this West

322
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,080
 Texas boy who was a good horseman in Kavett says, 'Well, that sounds like me, but I wasn't

323
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,920
 there.'" And then this was after Weaver had interviewed him. We look at the testimony

324
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,960
 in the report, and Kavett says, "Well, I noticed it was a weather balloon immediately.

325
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,200
 The next question should have been, did you communicate this rather vital piece of intelligence

326
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:33,120
 to Jesse Marcel?" But they go off on another tangent. Kavett made it clear that the CIC

327
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,960
 was a Class II facility on Roswell, which means he did not report to Blanchard in the

328
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,920
 chain of command. Blanchard was required to support his activity. But he should have said

329
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,120
 something to Blanchard before he sends people out to clean the mess up and before he issues

330
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,360
 a press release and says, "Well, we've got a flying saucer."

331
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,720
 Thank you very much. Thank you.

332
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,480
 Well, our next person to question is Carolyn Kirkpatrick.

333
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:14,320
 Thank you, old chairman. Mr. Schmidt. Could you give me four sound scientific reasons

334
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:22,280
 why we ought to look further into Roswell or why Roswell is important to what we're

335
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,680
 discussing this week?

336
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:34,360
 Very good. As I remarked in my opening statement, we're here representing the memories of so

337
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,480
 many of the hundreds of witnesses that we have interviewed through the years. We remain

338
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,920
 in contact with the families as they continue to encourage us to not only pursue a final

339
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:58,240
 solution to what their parents so often died with or would confide, finally, to having

340
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,960
 truth without proof. It was one of the problems, as we depicted even in the Roswell movie,

341
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:12,960
 that you can swear on a stack of Bibles that this happened, but without the physical proof,

342
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:20,520
 just as none of us. We can't prove this. So what we're asking or what we're certainly

343
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:27,240
 asking as far as your counsel on behalf of those now deceased witnesses as well as their

344
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:35,360
 surviving families, what type of effort on our part or how would you advise us to even

345
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,880
 continue the work of the late Congressman Stephen Schiff in pushing for a disclosure

346
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,520
 of the file, an opening of the Roswell file once and for all. We don't want to see Project

347
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:55,160
 Mogul. We know all about Project Mogul, and it does not address the eyewitness testimony.

348
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:02,360
 The wooden crash dummies wasn't even that same year. It was five years removed. We're

349
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:15,440
 talking about sworn affidavits, deathbed declarations, and the support of the families who would

350
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,160
 at least like to know that their spouses, their husbands, their fathers didn't live

351
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:28,960
 a lie, didn't persist in maintaining that this was something extraordinary, this was

352
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:37,600
 something beyond any earthly comprehension. The fact that as I keep harkening back to

353
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:46,860
 your own esteemed colleague, Congressman Schiff, he obviously saw that he was being stonewalled,

354
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,600
 that there was much more to this.

355
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:59,520
 Please stop. Give me three or four specific scientific realities that we know happened

356
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,360
 at Roswell, in Roswell.

357
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,040
 It's an historic fact that the United States Army Air Corps announced on July 8th that

358
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,840
 they had captured a flying saucer. That's not scientific, it's historic.

359
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:20,000
 And they acknowledged that Mr. Marcellus' father saw particles.

360
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Yes.

361
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Some people saw a crash.

362
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Yes.

363
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,840
 And did you just say the military or our government acknowledged that a flying saucer or something

364
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
 crashed?

365
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
 They put out a press release.

366
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
 Okay, that's a good one.

367
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,240
 That they actually captured a flying disk, correct.

368
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,280
 Okay, that's one.

369
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:46,280
 Two would be the fact that for years thereafter, no matter what, the second solution to the

370
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,800
 recovery, the weather balloon, eyewitnesses were still discussing this with their families,

371
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,520
 still saying that the flying saucer was the correct explanation, even to their deathbeds.

372
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,760
 The third would be the deathbed testimonies admissible in a court of law.

373
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,680
 And what did one or two of them allude to or testify to or say?

374
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
 As I stated earlier.

375
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
 That they saw it?

376
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
 They saw it crash?

377
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:19,960
 They would talk about either guarding, shipping, crating up, flying out, the remains, the wreckage,

378
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
 handling of the wreckage.

379
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,960
 Okay.

380
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,960
 Seeing the bodies.

381
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,000
 All that needs to be on the record.

382
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 That's why I want you to be specific and you're doing well.

383
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 One more, sir?

384
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,080
 Any one other thing, if there is one, if there's none, that's okay.

385
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,320
 Fourth would certainly be flight records, for example.

386
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:41,600
 Records as far as outgoing cryptology records from the base.

387
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,040
 This was one of the things that even Congressman Schiff was pushing for through the general

388
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,280
 accounting office for all the records concerning the events.

389
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:58,440
 And the GAO, their information received from all branches of the military, specifically

390
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:06,960
 the Air Force, was that all the records of the base of Roswell in the summer of 1947

391
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,240
 had been mysteriously destroyed.

392
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
 Okay.

393
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,320
 Now, we don't believe that for a second.

394
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,880
 No, they're classified.

395
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
 They're over there somewhere.

396
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
 Okay.

397
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
 That's right.

398
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
 I don't want to lose what we have.

399
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
 Our responsibility is here.

400
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,640
 So those records exist.

401
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,400
 And we would also ask that, again, if they were to disclose anything else.

402
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,280
 Anything else of this panel, and others probably too, and you just identified three or four

403
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
 things just off the top.

404
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,960
 There might be ten.

405
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,640
 That would give us something in writing, a page or two, with listing those so that we

406
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
 wouldn't have to dig them up.

407
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,600
 It would help us in our deliberations or whatever recommendation we would make.

408
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,120
 If the experts can provide, particularly this on Roswell and some of the other things that

409
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,600
 we heard in the last three days, and I'm sure the next two, that would help us make intelligent

410
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,640
 decisions on what we might get together and try to agree on and try to recommend, if we

411
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
 can come to such a point.

412
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
 That would be helpful.

413
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
 Let me just...

414
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
 I should...

415
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,400
 Well, just, we did mention that during the break.

416
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,720
 That we should have provided you with a timeline, a breakdown, a principle.

417
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
 But...

418
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
 It's not too late, though.

419
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
 It's not too late.

420
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,560
 The fact that if we combine as far as Stan's efforts and our own, we're talking a combination

421
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,520
 of we're approaching 100 years of research in this.

422
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,200
 I understand, I understand.

423
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,880
 And it has become so complicated, so involved, that to just provide even a briefing paper,

424
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,280
 we would be happy to do that.

425
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
 Okay.

426
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,600
 And what I'm suggesting is that you all have the briefing paper and we'll brief who we

427
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,120
 want to share this information with.

428
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,220
 We don't have to have it quite finite like that.

429
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,200
 We do have to have it in a statement of two or three sentences that we would understand

430
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,360
 that we can teach and mobilize and educate others so that we know what we're talking

431
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
 about.

432
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,960
 I mean, you guys need to actually give it to them and give them the detailed information.

433
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,000
 That's not to mention that you probably shouldn't have some.

434
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,240
 If it's this important, and I think that it is in terms of what we're here for this week,

435
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,880
 there ought to be something, a document, a something, that all of you all can come behind

436
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,560
 in all the research that you've done.

437
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,960
 You know something, you know how you're in college and get these primers?

438
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,080
 It doesn't have to be a big volume.

439
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,840
 You've got them in a lot of volumes already just pulling it together.

440
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,320
 Because of all the work that members of the House and Senate do in this town, it's going

441
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,320
 to be something like that.

442
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,680
 It's not going to be a big volume that gets the attention.

443
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,600
 It's what you say, how you say it, and how concise you can do it.

444
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,640
 If you'll do that, that'll help us do whatever we're going to finally end up doing and presenting.

445
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,840
 I forgot that the panel wasn't at my lecture last night where I went into service.

446
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
 Too late.

447
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,840
 We started six in the morning.

448
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
 We don't do that.

449
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
 You're right.

450
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
 I mean, we really do.

451
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:46,080
 And we go from six in the morning, contrary to what the newspaper says about all of us,

452
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
 we work very hard.

453
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,800
 From six in the morning to ten or eleven at night.

454
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
 But it's all nonstop.

455
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,680
 But we're very sorry that we couldn't get in.

456
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,320
 We probably won't be the ones this evening.

457
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,160
 But that's not to say that we aren't interested in what you do and what you say.

458
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,000
 And we have prepared briefing documents in the past when we have responded to the Air

459
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,520
 Force, for example, regarding Project Mobile.

460
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,720
 And we would have press conferences and we would have briefing documents to present as

461
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
 far as to the media.

462
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
 Thank you.

463
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
 Thank you.

464
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
 We'll go back, sir.

465
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
 Thank you very much.

466
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
 Congressman?

467
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
 Congresswoman?

468
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
 Lynn?

469
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:28,880
 You, he knows my name, thank you.

470
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:40,720
 Somewhere in today's testimonies in the papers, was it Major Marcel that was put into, taken,

471
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,320
 put in a house where he was held kind of hostage?

472
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,160
 Oh, that was Brazel.

473
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,040
 Talk about that a little bit.

474
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,840
 What was that about and how did he get through that?

475
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,880
 What happened is Brazel came in the course on a Sunday and announced that he had this

476
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
 debris.

477
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,760
 He then led Marcel and Cavett back out to the ranch.

478
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,280
 They brought the material back to Roswell.

479
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,160
 He stayed at the ranch.

480
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:18,040
 Now a couple of days later, the radio station owner of KGFL brought Brazel back into town

481
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,280
 so that they could interview him.

482
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,440
 They recorded an hour-long interview with him.

483
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,000
 Before they could air that, they got, and we have this testimony on both audio and video

484
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,480
 tape from Jud Roberts, who was a minority station owner of KGFL, that they were told

485
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:42,000
 by their congressional representatives that if they aired that report, they better start

486
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,080
 looking for another job because they wouldn't be in the radio business anymore.

487
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,360
 Walt Whitmore, who was the majority owner, took Brazel out to the base.

488
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,800
 That's how he got out to the base.

489
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,280
 They then kept him out there for a number of days.

490
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,440
 They brought him into, or took him into Roswell to the newspaper.

491
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,760
 He made the statement that appeared on July 9th about the harassed rancher who found the

492
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,360
 whole thing.

493
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,920
 According to what Brazel said to neighbors, Marion Strickland, the proctors, and people

494
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,160
 like this, he was held there for a number of days and was not allowed to leave so that

495
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,240
 the military had him in custody.

496
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,640
 Edwin Easley, who was the provost marshal, was the one who told me that he was held in

497
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,180
 the guest house as opposed to another facility on the base.

498
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,520
 He was held there for a number of days.

499
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,320
 His son, Bill Brazel, read about his father in the newspaper, went to the ranch.

500
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,760
 His father wasn't there.

501
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,200
 He came back a number of days.

502
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:43,640
 The best estimate is he was held in Roswell for four to six days after he had returned.

503
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,120
 Is that when he stopped talking?

504
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,960
 He was told ... I always got the impression from talking to Bill Brazel that they merely

505
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,240
 said to him, "We would rather you kept this quiet."

506
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,840
 Bill said to us, and my father was such a man, that if you asked him to do something

507
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,840
 like that and he gave his word, then that was good enough and he wasn't going to talk

508
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
 about it.

509
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,640
 He shared very little with his family about what had happened to him or the neighbors,

510
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,040
 but he was really annoyed about being held in Roswell for a number of days.

511
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,360
 That is what he talked about to the neighbors, and we have a great deal of testimony from

512
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,400
 those who heard him talking about it.

513
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,120
 You're talking about a civilian who is essentially arrested, detained by the military for five

514
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,600
 to six days.

515
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,240
 He was not afforded due process, your typical two phone calls.

516
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,280
 He was not even allowed to call his own wife to tell her where he was and that he was okay.

517
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,960
 He described how he was kept up all hours of the night and he was asked the same questions

518
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,840
 over and over again.

519
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:49,240
 It still comes back to what information, what did he see that was so sensitive that the

520
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:56,360
 military sought in their best interest to keep him under lock and key until they gained

521
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:04,740
 his cooperation and then were assured in their releasing him that he would not say anything

522
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,280
 further about this.

523
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,960
 As his son Bill would say to us, "It's better you don't know.

524
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,960
 Don't ask.

525
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
 It's better you don't know."

526
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
 Okay.

527
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,120
 I really don't have anything else, so thank you.

528
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,800
 Thank you very much, Congressman.

529
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,480
 Again, thank you all very much for your testimony.

530
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,520
 These were not animal remains in that rocket.

531
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,600
 I can say that with some confidence because I was involved in the first suborbital primate

532
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,120
 flight in Pensacola, Florida and I went there in 1959.

533
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:51,480
 It was about 1960 that we did the first suborbital primate flight early, early in our space venture.

534
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,160
 Was there a mogul launch that could have been responsible for this?

535
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:04,240
 The evidence that has been presented, it was Dr. Albert Crary's diary who gave us the information.

536
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,160
 The identified flight was supposedly flight number four on June 4th, 1947.

537
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,600
 According to Crary's diary, because of cloud cover, the missile launch had been canceled,

538
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,720
 so their flight was canceled.

539
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,200
 Charles Moore, who was a scientist, told me when that happened, they stripped the equipment

540
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,820
 from the balloons, from the arrays, but they couldn't let the helium out of the balloons,

541
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,160
 so they would let the balloons go.

542
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,820
 Crary's diary then has a cryptic note about on the same day that we flew Sonoboy up there

543
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,560
 and couldn't get good reception, so there's some discussion about it.

544
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,920
 The first recorded flight for Project Mogul was flight number five.

545
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,520
 There had been three flights in New Jersey prior to them getting to New Mexico.

546
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:54,760
 The documentation is a little bit hinky on that, but according to what Charles Moore

547
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:02,640
 had said in a letter that he wrote in 1995, that they didn't file the notum as they were

548
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,280
 required by the CAA at the time.

549
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,520
 I'm sure he did this because we went through the archives.

550
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,880
 I went to the archives looking for the notums because I'd like to see how they described

551
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,940
 the arrays and if there was a notum for the June 4th launch.

552
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,880
 He said in a 1995 letter that they had not contacted the FAA because they didn't expect

553
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,560
 this mythical flight to get off the restricted area at White Sand.

554
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,800
 Even if the flight was launched, it wasn't expected to reach any altitudes and it wasn't

555
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,160
 suspected to get off the White Sand's missile range, according to him.

556
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,480
 I'm sure that he'd said that simply because that would explain why there was no FAA notification.

557
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,440
 There was no good documentation that flight number four ever was launched.

558
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,320
 There was no good documentation that it reached the Brazel Ranch.

559
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:56,200
 There was no good documentation that Brazel was unable to identify the weather balloons.

560
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,280
 The Mogul arrays were just weather balloons.

561
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,280
 There were weather balloons.

562
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,040
 There was 15, 20 weather balloons strung together, but it's still weather balloons.

563
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,520
 Jesse Marcel would have recognized the weather balloons for what they were.

564
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,700
 Cavett obviously recognized the weather balloons, but the point is simply that had it been a

565
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,320
 Project Mogul flight, we would have been able to identify it specifically from the testimonies

566
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,920
 of the witnesses and the documentation available.

567
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,400
 Why would they need a several day cleanup if it was a Mogul balloon?

568
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,360
 They wouldn't have if it had been a Mogul.

569
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,880
 Was there in fact, is that well documented there was a several day cleanup with a number

570
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,800
 of military people?

571
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,960
 According to the witnesses, the people who were on the debris field cleaning it up, the

572
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,680
 men who were there that we were able to interview prior to their deaths, some of them on audio

573
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,320
 tape, some of them on video tape, they spent several days cleaning up the debris on the

574
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,640
 Brazel Ranch site.

575
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,640
 Yes.

576
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,640
 Okay.

577
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,120
 Before my dad died, I asked him, "Would any of the debris still be out there?"

578
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,240
 And he says, "No, they vacuum the place up."

579
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,240
 That was his words.

580
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,240
 They vacuumed it up.

581
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,240
 Okay.

582
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,240
 Okay.

583
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,240
 Really thorough cleanup.

584
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,520
 Why do we assume that other intelligent life has to look something like us?

585
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,520
 We don't.

586
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,320
 Isn't that a little arrogant?

587
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,320
 We don't.

588
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
 We don't?

589
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,320
 You're talking about humanoids.

590
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,320
 You go with the flow.

591
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,520
 You're talking about humanoids.

592
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,520
 That's what people say.

593
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,520
 Oh.

594
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,520
 You go with the flow.

595
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,520
 Yeah.

596
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,280
 But they would have said, "They're two arms, two legs ahead in the body."

597
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:32,360
 The guys with three arms and three legs go to Jupiter, you know, for their vacation.

598
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:41,580
 On the other hand, it may be that we are somebody's colony that they seated us here, a penal colony

599
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,560
 that they call dead boys and girls here.

600
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,040
 I'm sure there are some debunkers who have suggested that if we're seeing humanoids,

601
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,480
 we're hallucinating because it's perfectly conceivable that other intelligent life could

602
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,280
 have a different form than we have.

603
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,700
 But not necessarily.

604
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:05,800
 As Dr. Michael Swartz, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan Kalamazoo, professor

605
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:14,840
 of natural history, biologists, has suggested, if we consider biological symmetry, that throughout

606
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:21,660
 the universe that there would be a common link, that there would potentially be a resemblance,

607
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,840
 that they would be humanoid.

608
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
 That's conceivable.

609
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,840
 That's conceivable.

610
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,160
 That's what the evidence shows.

611
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,120
 It doesn't mean that there's nobody else out there.

612
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,120
 Non-humanoid.

613
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,120
 It doesn't mean that.

614
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:39,160
 In fact, if you take a look at all of the history of UFO sightings when they've reported

615
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,660
 occupants or creatures from inside, historically most of them have been humanoid.

616
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:50,000
 There are some cases where one of them was described as a hairy jelly bean bag.

617
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 Things like that.

618
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,640
 But the testimony from the people who've seen creatures from inside the craft normally report

619
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
 a humanoid.

620
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,640
 Maybe taller than us.

621
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,640
 Maybe shorter than us.

622
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,640
 Maybe much more robust.

623
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,700
 But it's usually a humanoid creature.

624
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,920
 There are some cases where they're robotic in nature.

625
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,640
 And in Pascagoula, the fellows there described something that really wasn't much in the way

626
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,840
 of a humanoid but resembled vaguely a human.

627
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,780
 I knew Steve Schiff, by the way.

628
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,000
 I was on the committee.

629
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,720
 I was there when we had that.

630
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,720
 I thought it was a hearing.

631
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,480
 I'm told now that it wasn't a hearing, that it was a briefing.

632
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,600
 But sometimes it's hard to tell briefings from hearings in your memory.

633
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:39,480
 I know that he was concerned about this and was pushing to learn something.

634
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,400
 I mentioned before that there were two reasons, two things you could cite that tells you that

635
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
 the Air Force is not being truthful.

636
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,840
 There are really three.

637
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:57,240
 The press release they made.

638
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:04,320
 The fact that they sent these people these findings to Wright-Patterson.

639
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,320
 And the third thing is they were cleaning it up.

640
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,800
 If it was a weather balloon, none of those things would have been -- none of those things

641
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,800
 would have happened.

642
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,240
 Well, the first one, there might have been some confusion, wild confusion, the first

643
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,240
 one.

644
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,680
 But the second two, never.

645
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,000
 Never sent anything to Wright-Patterson.

646
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,200
 And they never would have cleaned up anything if it had been a weather balloon.

647
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,200
 What challenge?

648
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,840
 How do they explain that?

649
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,880
 >> That our witnesses are all lying.

650
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
 >> That's the only explanation.

651
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,600
 >> That's the only explanation.

652
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,880
 >> Nothing was ever sent to Wright-Patterson and nothing was ever cleaned up?

653
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:44,240
 >> There's the FBI telex from the FBI bureau in Dallas, Texas, that went out the very evening,

654
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:51,080
 6/17 p.m., that the weather balloon explanation had just come out from General Raimi's press

655
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,280
 conference.

656
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,400
 And it refuted that.

657
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,680
 Raimi had canceled the continuing flight on to Wright Field.

658
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,000
 And that stated that based on their telephonic conversation between Wright Field and their

659
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,320
 FBI office, that this belief was not borne out.

660
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:15,200
 In other words, the balloon explanation was not what they've been talking about, it's

661
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,200
 not what they were hearing.

662
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,400
 >> When did they switch from the weather balloon to mogul?

663
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,400
 >> In 1994.

664
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,200
 >> Ooh, quite a while.

665
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,200
 >> Oh, yeah.

666
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,400
 >> But that was mainly due to, again, Congressman Schiff pushing for release of the files.

667
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,880
 >> They had to find something that was so highly classified, they'd explain why they

668
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,920
 went against Herculean efforts, and that was where the mythology grew that mogul was so

669
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
 highly classified.

670
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,360
 Yes, the explanation was classified, but all the experiments going on in New Mexico simply

671
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,120
 were not.

672
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,520
 >> The purpose was classified.

673
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,520
 >> Yep.

674
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,520
 >> But not the equipment.

675
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,840
 >> But they were using common weather balloons, I understand.

676
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
 >> Not the materials.

677
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,800
 >> Standard weather balloons at 20-foot intervals by strength.

678
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,200
 >> So the only thing classified was that they had some additional instrumentation on it

679
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,080
 for picking up this radiation stuff.

680
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,080
 >> No.

681
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,080
 >> No, no, not at all.

682
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,920
 Everything on the mogul arrays launched in New Mexico was off-the-shelf materials.

683
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,160
 There were weather balloons, there were what they called a raywind radar target.

684
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,720
 >> It was a program that was classified?

685
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
 >> Yes.

686
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,720
 >> The purpose.

687
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,720
 >> The purpose was classified.

688
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,720
 >> The objective.

689
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,720
 >> I got you.

690
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
 Objective classified, okay.

691
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,600
 >> But they said it was so highly classified, the people in New Mexico didn't even know

692
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,280
 the names, yet when you look at Albert Crary's diary, he uses the name mogul in there at

693
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,520
 least twice.

694
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,160
 So he's well aware of what the name was.

695
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,800
 So it's an ongoing thing that they've done and been bought into by an awful lot of the

696
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,800
 press.

697
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,800
 Well, it was explained as project mogul.

698
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,800
 It simply does not work.

699
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,200
 >> Now, the project was so effective as it was designed to determine as far as from high

700
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,760
 altitude, should the Soviets detonate their first atomic bomb, we would pick up the shock

701
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:55,520
 wave from this acoustic listing device, this microphone, that when they did first detonate

702
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:03,240
 an atomic bomb in August of 1949, it wasn't mogul that picked it up.

703
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,320
 Mogul failed.

704
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:12,840
 We picked it up as far as due to chatter, talk, and air sampling as far as higher radiation

705
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
 levels.

706
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,840
 >> Yeah.

707
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,840
 By and by they get here.

708
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,840
 So the winds go around, yeah.

709
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:23,660
 Why would it surprise anybody that we were trying to determine whether the Soviets were

710
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,080
 detonating a weapon?

711
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,600
 >> Why would that surprise people?

712
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,600
 Why should that be?

713
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,400
 I was in the Congress for 20 years.

714
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,360
 I was on the Armed Services Committee for 20 years.

715
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,120
 I sat in a very large number of briefings.

716
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,880
 I can classify briefings.

717
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,720
 I can tell you that I cannot remember a single thing that I was told that I think would give

718
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,240
 aid and comfort to the enemy.

719
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,280
 We classify way too much.

720
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,880
 There's an old accent that says what's everybody's business is nobody's business.

721
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:57,600
 When you classify everything, nothing is classified, and we're pretty darn close to that.

722
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:03,080
 >> I think in 1947 the thought process was that they didn't -- we didn't want the Soviets

723
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,360
 to know that we had the capability to spy on them to do that.

724
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,000
 >> But the fact that we were sending something up there to listen wouldn't mean we had a

725
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 capability.

726
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,360
 >> Pretty sophisticated when you think about it just being a balloon with a kite.

727
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,360
 >> Yeah.

728
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,360
 Okay.

729
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,360
 Thank you all very much.

730
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,160
 As we send the way through, this has been a very productive first three days.

731
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,120
 Thank you all very much.

732
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,120
 [ Applause ]

733
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:32,200
 >> I've got three brief points to make.

734
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:38,800
 One, is there any speculation out there why the UFO crashed?

735
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,120
 Have you heard anything?

736
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,240
 >> There's a lot of speculation.

737
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,360
 >> Share one with us.

738
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,480
 >> It ran into a radar beam.

739
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,920
 I mean, that sounds a little strange, but we know that there was a launch scheduled

740
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,800
 for White Sands, and we know that they -- those were vacuum tube radars, so they were left

741
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,440
 on so they wouldn't have to warm up.

742
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,440
 They were not transistorized or anything like that.

743
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:14,480
 So if pilot and a wingman -- 40% of the cases involve more than one object seen at a time.

744
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,840
 If they just happened to cross this beam -- this wasn't searching this way, just a beam aiming

745
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:25,560
 out there, maybe killing a pigeon or something.

746
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:33,200
 You run into the beam, and it discombobulates your guidance system, your propulsion system.

747
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:39,260
 Maybe they go like this, the two pilot and wingman kind of thing.

748
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:48,120
 And so that sounds dumb, not sophisticated, if you will, but you have to expect surprises.

749
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:52,080
 It's like drive through New Mexico and run into a hailstorm, and I got bumps all over

750
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,080
 my car.

751
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,080
 New Mexico?

752
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,080
 It's dry.

753
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,080
 What kind of hailstorm?

754
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,840
 It was a big hailstorm.

755
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,120
 There's another point here, too.

756
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:09,080
 General Groves, Manhattan Project Groves, as late as '48 was saying it would take the

757
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:14,160
 Russians eight years before they could build an atomic bomb, because they just don't have

758
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,960
 the industrial capacity that we do.

759
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,080
 It took one.

760
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,680
 There was an attitude in Washington.

761
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,840
 This is a bunch of dumb peasants, you know, not sophisticated, oh, maybe they've got spies

762
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,140
 here and there, but nothing to it.

763
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:36,000
 And so this really shook them up.

764
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,680
 So they said even if they got a bomb, they had no means for delivering it, casually forgetting

765
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:49,560
 that we'd left a B-29, but they then copied and built a bunch of, and shocked us when

766
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:55,240
 they displayed them in Moscow at their usual dog and pony show.

767
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:03,840
 So the atomic bomb end of things was of great concern to the United States, because there

768
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:10,960
 was real concern that once we found out, and one of the scariest memos I've ever seen from

769
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:19,200
 all the archive research is a National Security Council memo in the early 1950 saying the

770
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,520
 Russians have made more progress in the past 18 months in the development of nuclear weapons

771
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:32,680
 and methods for delivering them that had been expected for five years.

772
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,280
 They were concerned, and wouldn't you be under those conditions?

773
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,280
 Very much so.

774
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,920
 If I might speculate, you wanted speculation, and here's my favorite speculation, they did

775
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,920
 it on purpose.

776
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,800
 They crashed on purpose.

777
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:51,280
 What they wanted, they wanted the most non-hostile way of announcing their presence to the earth

778
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:58,560
 and what is more, would make us feel easier if we picked up the craft and the bodies and

779
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:04,600
 realize that they are as delicate as we are, as fragile as we are, they're non-confrontational.

780
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,280
 Now we have the information.

781
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,680
 Their plan failed simply because they crashed at Roswell and the embargo on the news went

782
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,680
 down.

783
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,680
 But I've always liked that theory.

784
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,480
 I don't subscribe to it, you understand, but I've always liked that theory that they did

785
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,480
 it on purpose.

786
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,480
 That's interesting.

787
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,480
 Please.

788
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,800
 These might have been clones that were expendable.

789
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:27,160
 That's more of an American approach.

790
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:33,800
 Let me point out earlier, I can't identify which one of you suggested it, but I think

791
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,600
 it was more than once.

792
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,280
 What should you do now after the hearings?

793
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,760
 We've got two more days of hearings and I want to stress that tomorrow we're hearing

794
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,600
 testimony from people from South America and that's in the morning and in the afternoon

795
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:56,440
 we're hearing from people from the rest of the world who've stepped forward to testify.

796
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,160
 So this is very important.

797
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:04,680
 Up till now it's been pretty much a homegrown American approach and I think it's much more

798
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,880
 significant from a world point of view.

799
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,400
 So you're asking what effort.

800
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:16,560
 Again, I think I've alluded to this earlier, but the Congress I think is a dead letter

801
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,680
 to accomplish anything in that regard.

802
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:24,560
 I say this with all due respect to the Congress who have a lot of fine people, but I think

803
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:32,600
 that the best effort we have for bringing visibility to the people of the world of this

804
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:40,000
 issue, you're probably not all that familiar with the various conferences that the UN have.

805
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,240
 Remember they had the conference on the child, the conference on women?

806
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:51,000
 They garner unbelievable attention in the buildup for these conferences.

807
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,160
 So I would ask that you use your good offices and certainly we may try to approach this

808
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,720
 that we could go to the United Nations.

809
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,680
 Now I don't think we'd have a prayer in the Security Council because it's controlled

810
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,080
 by us and that just wouldn't happen.

811
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:14,320
 But what would happen in the General Assembly if we were to introduce a resolution or if

812
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,680
 we can't do it as Americans we could do it maybe through the Brazilian government or

813
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,960
 the Canadian government, they would introduce a resolution and the General Assembly, I'll

814
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,440
 bet you it would pass, they would fund some part of it, the rest of the funding could

815
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:35,600
 come from private sources and we would have the most awe-inspiring world event on this

816
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,240
 subject within a couple, three years.

817
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:48,280
 And so I would ask you, I would suggest that you use your good offices to work with us

818
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,960
 as individuals or as a group to try to bring this about.

819
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:59,760
 And we're not prejudging anything, we're just feeling that this issue addresses the

820
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,960
 entire civilization of what we are on this planet.

821
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,700
 Let me thank everybody for today's participation.

822
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,480
 Obviously later in the day the number of people diminished.

823
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:19,600
 But let me emphasize, tomorrow is a very, very significant day for a hearing because

824
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:25,480
 we are broadening out as Americans to a global identification.

825
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,800
 So again, these hearings are adjourned.
