1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
 >> This hearing is in order. We've got our witnesses ready and --

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,960
 >> And gentlemen, if you could stand and repeat after me.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
 I do hereby affirm. >> I do hereby affirm.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
 >> That I will tell the truth. >> I will tell the truth.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,200
 >> And nothing but the truth. >> And nothing but the truth.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,760
 >> To this committee today. >> To this committee today.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,200
 >> Thank you, Mr. Chair. >> And before I move to the next witness,

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
 if I could just indicate that I'm pleased. I don't know if you have a copy of the letter.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,720
 Yes, you do. So if you could hand that to me.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,760
 >> Would you like to read this? >> Well, no. Dr. Bookman, I'd have you read

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,280
 that letter. >> There's not just one letter that the committee

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
 created. We also have all six members who have signed this because it does not deal

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,720
 with a foreign government. It deals with the Veterans Affairs Administration and is also

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,020
 addressed to the President of the United States. We're all six members of this committee, and

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,120
 I won't take the time to read it. You're welcome to come up later. Basically demand

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:16,120
 that Jim Pinnison and Airman Burroughs be granted their medical records from this government.

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:29,120
 >> Just a point of personal privilege, if I can just say that beyond the obvious benefits

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:38,160
 to those two heroic former members of the United States Air Force, the release of those

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,560
 records, the obvious medical benefits are clear, and that's alone enough reason for

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,840
 us to sign that. But the obvious implications of what's on those records in terms of breaking

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,760
 down the wall or putting another crack in that truce embargo are, I think, obvious to

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:03,840
 people in this room for sure. Let's go to our esteemed Honorable Paul Hellyer of Canada.

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,400
 We would give you 20 minutes, sir. >> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,760
 you for giving me this opportunity to speak. My name, as I said, was Paul Hellyer. I'm

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,480
 a former Minister of National Defence for Canada. I served in three governments during

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,800
 a total of 23 and a half years as a member of Parliament. Although as Minister of National

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:35,600
 Defence, I had sighting reports of UFOs. I was too busy to be concerned about them at

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,400
 the time because I was trying to unify the Army, Navy and Air Force into a single Canadian

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:47,240
 Defence Force, and that itself was a kind of battle to the finish. So this was not high

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:54,320
 on my agenda. But about 10 years ago, I started getting interested due to a young man from

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,880
 Ottawa sending me material on the subject. I told him I was too busy to read it, but

32
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,880
 he had confidence that someday I would. He sent me a copy of Colonel Corso's book, The

33
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,240
 Day After Roswell. It took me a while to get around to reading it, but I took it for my

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:24,800
 summer reading in 2005 and was really impressed with what was contained in it. And what I

35
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,800
 thought to myself is there are huge issues here, huge issues, and the American people

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,040
 and the people of the world have a right to know what's going on because they're part

37
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:45,040
 of it. It's not just an isolated thing. And so after confirming the contents of the book

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,960
 with a retired United States Air Force General, I accepted the invitation of Victor Vigiani,

39
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:59,760
 who's over here somewhere, and his cohort, Mike Bird, to speak to a symposium at the

40
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:09,520
 University of Toronto. And I said, UFOs are as real as the airplanes flying overhead.

41
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,520
 That gave me the dubious distinction of being the first person of cabinet rank in the G8

42
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:29,520
 group of countries to say so unequivocally. Since then, I've learned a lot from many

43
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,240
 sources, including a number of the fantastic witnesses that we have heard these last four

44
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,240
 days. So they're so outstanding. I was just really blown away with them, the amount of

45
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,880
 information that was available. And I appreciate every single one of them. But because I'm

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,800
 not a ufologist, I'm a politician, there are only a few things that I want to add in that

47
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,560
 particular realm. The first is that about in the 1960s sometime, there was a flotilla

48
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:11,040
 of UFOs headed south that crossed into NATO territory in Europe. And the commander-in-chief

49
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:20,720
 of the Supreme Allied Headquarters in Europe was naturally very shaken. Fortunately, or

50
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,400
 maybe divine providence before the panic button was pushed, the flotilla turned around and

51
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,520
 headed back north. Obviously, they had thought maybe they were Russian and they were very

52
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:43,560
 concerned about it. Anyway, an investigation was launched into this whole subject. And

53
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:55,880
 a document was prepared which concluded that at least four species had been visiting Earth

54
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:07,800
 for thousands of years. And this is my own view at this stage as well. So except for

55
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,000
 that, there are just a couple of things that we've talked about that I'd like to refer

56
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,120
 to. And one was that we were referring to them as they until this morning when Linda

57
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,520
 Bolton Howe, I think she was the first one, actually named three different species. I

58
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,160
 have brought my latest book called Light at the End of the Tunnel, the Survival Plan for

59
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:41,520
 the Human Species as an aide-memoire. And I named five different species here. I'm aware

60
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,960
 of more now. As a matter of fact, I saw a document just a few days ago that mentioned

61
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,680
 20. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman. We're interested in some of the places they might come from.

62
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:07,160
 So I have in here Zeta Reticuli, the Pleiades, Orion, and Romita, and the Altair star systems.

63
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:16,800
 So I don't think we can any more refer them to them as they because they're not an amorphous

64
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,600
 mass. They are different species and consequently may have different agendas. I don't think

65
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,520
 we can say that they all have the same agenda any more than that we could say that the United

66
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:35,360
 States, China, and Russia had the same agenda. Our real interests may be very similar, but

67
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:43,240
 as of now our perceived interests are still quite far apart. One more observation before

68
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,520
 I begin what I want to say, and that is that we spent quite a bit of time talking about

69
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:56,000
 the 66 year old cadavers. And I was glad to have Linda this morning finally say that there

70
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,640
 are live ETs on earth at this present time, and at least two of them probably working

71
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:14,000
 with the United States government. The seventh, the other species that I learned about not

72
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,760
 too long ago was called the tall whites. And this is when Paula Harris broke the story

73
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,920
 just a few years ago. And through her good offices I had the chance to talk for about

74
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:36,440
 three hours with former Airman Charles Hall and listen to this absolutely fascinating

75
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:45,160
 story of how he was working. First of all he was scared out of his skin, but after that

76
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,440
 when he got to know them how he was working with and finally they became to trust each

77
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,920
 other and have a good working relationship with the tall whites at the gunnery range

78
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,480
 at Indian Springs in Nevada. And these tall whites were living on United States Air Force

79
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,580
 property and working in cooperation with the United States Air Force and sharing technology

80
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,200
 with them. He wrote a book incidentally called Millennial Hospitality. There are four different

81
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,040
 versions but Paula says that Millennial Hospitality number two is the best. I think that's the

82
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,600
 one I read and it's a very interesting read if you want to sort of get inside the problem

83
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:36,160
 of what it's like to bump into these people floating across the terrain in the desert.

84
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,800
 Enough on that for now, my interest is in full disclosure. And I just, my only caveat

85
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:51,940
 is I think probably I would say 95 to 98 percent full disclosure. I know of one or two things

86
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,040
 that I'm not sure should be in the public domain at least yet. They will be someday

87
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:06,540
 I'm sure but not maybe immediately. But just as children survive the idea of the tooth

88
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,600
 fairy and Santa Claus when they become adult, I think that taxpaying citizens are quite

89
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,080
 capable of accepting the new and broader reality that we live in a cosmos teeming with life

90
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,960
 of various sorts. The fact that some other civilizations are more advanced than we are

91
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:35,360
 may be humbling but that could be a necessary step in our survival. The world is an unholy

92
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,960
 mess. We have it best until the end of this decade. In my book I said we have ten years

93
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,360
 to stop global warming if we don't want it to be beyond the point of no return. Two years

94
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
 has gone past since it was written so I say we have until the end of the decade to arrest

95
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,720
 global warming. Yet our leaders don't even talk about it very much except in a superficial

96
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,080
 way. They appear to be more interested in starting wars to control more oil and in effect

97
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:09,920
 prolong the gravity of the threat. Of course even if they took the problem seriously they

98
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,320
 wouldn't have the finances to finance the transition from oil to the clean economy to

99
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,920
 the clean energy because we have an infinitely silly banking and financial system in the

100
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:35,760
 western world. And the United States Congress I regret to say is partly responsible and

101
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,520
 I'd be glad to elaborate on that later if you're interested. And finally they need the

102
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,960
 technology for clean energy and it exists and it's being kept secret by the same vested

103
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,720
 interests who control our destiny. Who are these vested interests and what are they up

104
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:09,960
 to? Well, Senator, we're talking about a military hunda. In my opinion that is true but I have

105
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:20,360
 broadened and deepened the definition to cabal and the cabal comprises members of the three

106
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:28,740
 sisters. The Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers and the Trilateral Commission,

107
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:37,040
 the International Banking Cartel, the Oil Cartel, members of various intelligence organizations

108
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,520
 and select members of the military unit who together have become a shadow government of

109
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:52,320
 not only the United States but of much of the western world. The Council on Foreign

110
00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:06,640
 Relations is the oldest of the three sisters and as early as October 1940, years before

111
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:13,360
 Germany surrendered to the allied armies to vaporize Hitler's vision of empire, the Council's

112
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:21,240
 economic and financial group drafted a memorandum outlining a comprehensive policy "to set forth

113
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:28,400
 the political, military, territorial and economic requirements of the United States in its political

114
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,680
 potential leadership of the non-German world including the United Kingdom itself as well

115
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,240
 as the western hemisphere and the far east." The Council made no effort to disguise the

116
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:47,160
 fact that the purpose of the Grand Area and later world hegemony was to support an expanding

117
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:54,600
 U.S. economy, to provide it with raw materials and markets for its products. This was labeled

118
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,200
 the "national interest." It was equally clear that the national interest was the interest

119
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,520
 of the ruling elite whose members comprised the Council. The real interests of the majority

120
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:19,920
 of rank-and-file Americans was never a factor in the equation. So Mr. David Rockefeller

121
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:28,160
 who is a member of all three of the sisters is quoted as saying this at a meeting of the

122
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:37,040
 Bilderbergers in Europe. We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time

123
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,960
 Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected

124
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,560
 their promises of discretion for almost 40 years. It would have been impossible for us

125
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,520
 to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity

126
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,840
 during those years. But the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march toward

127
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:12,760
 a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers

128
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:22,280
 is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries. He of course pretended

129
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:32,160
 he didn't say that, but the witness is reported by Daniel Estulin, a thoroughly reliable reporter

130
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,920
 who has written the true story of the Bilderberger group. And if you want to really get inside

131
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:47,000
 of what's been going on there for this long time, that's a good place to go. So anyway,

132
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,400
 you hear what Mr. Rockefeller said and so there you have it. The aim of the game is

133
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:02,680
 a world government comprising members of the cabal who are elected by no one and accountable

134
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:12,000
 to no one. And according to Mr. Rockefeller, the plan is well advanced. Does this help

135
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,680
 you to understand why our civil rights are being taken away from us? I say us because

136
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:27,400
 Canada too is included in the grand plan. A giant leap in the wrong direction followed

137
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,600
 the end of the Cold War. No one could have been happier than I was when the Berlin Wall

138
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,400
 came down on November the 9th, 1989. The elation on our side of the curtain was near universal

139
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:47,060
 and very significant on the other side as one country after another regained its freedom.

140
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,040
 Nearly everyone believed that it was the dawn of a new era of peace and prosperity for people

141
00:16:52,040 --> 00:17:00,600
 everywhere. There was much talk of a peace dividend. The prospects were dazzling, dazzling

142
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,240
 in their scope and diversity. It was a unique and God-given opportunity for a new braver

143
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:16,600
 and fairer world. We blew it. We blew the chance of a lifetime to do good things. A

144
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:24,280
 small group of zealots undermined our golden opportunity to pursue peace, not war, and

145
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:32,000
 little did we dream that they had a vastly different vision of the new world order. Their

146
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,120
 plan, which is now commonly known as the Project for a New American Century, included preventive

147
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:46,400
 wars and clear violation of international law, regime change wherever and whenever the

148
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,080
 U.S. desires and if they can get away with it without excessive casualties, and the establishment

149
00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:00,720
 of a kind of economic and cultural hegemony with America acting as "constabulary." That

150
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,320
 was their word, globally. This was to be accomplished without authority of the United Nations and

151
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,160
 without the restraint of existing international treaties. It would involve a military buildup

152
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,480
 unprecedented in peacetime history and could trigger an arms race which is precisely the

153
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,360
 opposite of the peace dividend that the world had rightly looked forward to. The Machiavellian

154
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,460
 scheme involved secret police, the curtailment of civil liberties and defiance of the U.S.

155
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:39,780
 Constitution, and a moribund economy operating way below its potential, exactly those features

156
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:49,400
 for which the Soviet Union was held in contempt. The initial draft of the document was so controversial

157
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,760
 when it was leaked to the New York Times that it had to be rewritten, but it was not changed

158
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:05,480
 very much, just the cosmetics, enough to make it politically acceptable. The document said

159
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,520
 this, "May have been easy to persuade President Bush to abandon his stated policy of not getting

160
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,640
 America more deeply involved in international affairs, but persuading the American people

161
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:23,120
 would be more difficult. Sophisticated Americans would question such a giant sea change in

162
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,320
 history. The authors of Rebuilding America's Defenses, Strategy, Forces, and Resources

163
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:36,120
 for a New Century recognize this difficulty from the outset because their document contained

164
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:43,680
 the following sentence. Further, I'm quoting, "Further, the process of transformation, even

165
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:51,320
 if it brings revolutionary changes, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic

166
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:59,400
 and catalyzing event, like a new Pearl Harbor." It wasn't too long before they got their catastrophic

167
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,360
 and catalyzing event. Terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon

168
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,880
 in Washington on September the 11th, 2011. Incidentally, they have removed the sentence

169
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 about Pearl Harbor in the document that you can now get if you went to the internet to

170
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:25,720
 find it. Almost the whole world mourned. Canada mourned. The overwhelming majority of Muslims

171
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,080
 condemned the treacherous attacks. My sympathy for the friends and families of the injured

172
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,220
 and dead was genuine and unwavering to this day. My sympathy for the U.S. government began

173
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,880
 to grow a bit thin, however, when I heard President Bush cite the reasons for the attack.

174
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:51,720
 And I quote, "Why do they hate us?" he asked rhetorically in an address to the Congress.

175
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,920
 They hate what they see right here in this chamber, democratically elected government.

176
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,520
 Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedoms, our freedom of religion, our

177
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,540
 freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other. I felt

178
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:14,400
 sad when I heard the President's word. I assumed that he believed what he was saying. But if

179
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,200
 that were true, he was profoundly ignorant of the real thoughts and feelings of people

180
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,520
 in other parts of the world. If he wanted to hear the truth, he should have listened

181
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,600
 to Osama bin Laden who was well informed concerning the origins of the kind of fanatical hatred

182
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,500
 of the United States which has led to such treachery. This is his version of events.

183
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,620
 Every Muslim must rise to defend his religion. The wind of faith is blowing and the wind

184
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:47,080
 of change is blowing to remove evil from the peninsula of Muhammad. Peace be upon him.

185
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,640
 As to America, I say to you and its people a few words. I swear to God that America will

186
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,280
 not live in peace before peace reigns in Palestine and before all the army of infidels depart

187
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:08,060
 the land of Muhammad. Peace be upon him. That is clear enough. The dislike of America has

188
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:15,400
 nothing to do with democracy versus dictatorship or wealth or freedom of religion or freedom

189
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:22,760
 of assembly. It is directly related to American foot dragging and stick handling, a just settlement

190
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,800
 of the Palestinian question.

191
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:32,840
 Mr. Heller, I hate to interrupt. Time has expired but I'm very happy if the panel has

192
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,560
 no objection to allow another minute or two to finish your statement. How much time do

193
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,680
 you think you need to finish it?

194
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,600
 I think probably somewhere between one and five minutes most.

195
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,080
 I think we'll give you two minutes to finish your statement as much as I'd like to grant

196
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,560
 more. Thank you.

197
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:04,360
 Okay. In short, American foreign policy was the root of the conflict. So here we are more

198
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,960
 than a decade later fighting another war that can't be won. There is no country on earth

199
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,960
 powerful enough to protect its citizens against fanatical hate as we learn from the Boston

200
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,360
 Marathon. And the mere attempt to pursue the impossible pits neighbor against neighbor

201
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,500
 and the state power structure against everyone. All of the freedoms won by the millions of

202
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,960
 men and women who fought and died in World War II are being flushed unceremoniously down

203
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,900
 the drain. The only hope of peace is a negotiated settlement. This will require a paradigm shift

204
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,960
 in American attitudes. It involves a de facto renunciation of the plan for a new American

205
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,600
 energy and the adoption of a pledge of cooperation with all humankind to build the kind of world

206
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,140
 which we are collectively capable of.

207
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,920
 Young people everywhere need to be challenged by a noble cause. They need to be involved

208
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:07,040
 in arresting global warming, creating a banking system that is just and sustainable and lead

209
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,240
 the way in the transformation to the new reality that we have to live in harmony with our celestial

210
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:25,740
 neighbors as well as seeking peace on earth. In a word, we have to become spiritual beings

211
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,880
 and practice the one tenet that the world's major religions have in common, and that is

212
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
 the golden rule.

213
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,160
 And this field too, and I just want to read one paragraph at this time if you'll allow

214
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:45,640
 me, Mr. Chair. This is from the late Dr. John Mack, an American secular Jewish psychiatrist

215
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:52,780
 who became a world leader in interviewing abductees or experiencers, as he called them,

216
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,840
 came to this conclusion in a startling book, Passport to the Cosmos. Quote, "Although the

217
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:07,560
 aliens are not themselves gods, their behavior is sometimes anything but godlike. Abductees

218
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:15,440
 consistently report that the beings seem closer to the godhead than we are, acting as messengers,

219
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,000
 guardian spirits or angels, intermediaries between us and the divine source." Thank

220
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 you.

221
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Thank you very much. We'll now hear from Richard Dolan for ten minutes.

222
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,680
 Thank you, distinguished members of the committee, and let me just say it's been an honor for

223
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,800
 me personally to be here with you all week to be able to give statements to you and chat

224
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,520
 with some of you privately as well.

225
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,600
 Regarding disclosure, I have often felt that disclosure on the matter of UFOs and ETs,

226
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,440
 possible extraterrestrials, is a paradox. It's impossible, but it is inevitable. It's

227
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,160
 impossible because there is no political motivation for it. It's inevitable, however, because

228
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,940
 our leaders are not the only factor in this equation. There are other beings, after all,

229
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:16,720
 but mainly I would say there is us, the people, who are going through this greatest social,

230
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,440
 cultural, and especially technological transformation in the history of humanity. In fact, I would

231
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,280
 say that we are the game changers.

232
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,200
 One day, and it won't be too long in the future, something is going to force someone's

233
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,440
 hand. It could be a major sighting. It could be a major leak. Something. Something that

234
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:45,440
 can no longer be denied. After all, we are fast approaching what experts in artificial

235
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,240
 intelligence call the singularity when computing intelligence exceeds our own. In such a future,

236
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,440
 I ask you, can we really think we will still be stuck in neutral on this issue? Something

237
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,800
 will force the president's hand. He or she will finally hold that long-awaited press

238
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,160
 conference and make that bombshell statement. It might go something like this.

239
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,080
 I have been advised by the National Security Council and heads of our intelligence community

240
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:21,160
 that there is a reality to some of the UFO phenomenon, in that some UFOs are real physical

241
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:28,400
 craft not manufactured by any known civilization on earth. Or words to that effect.

242
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,120
 It's the kind of statement that many proponents of UFO disclosure would like to hear, but

243
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:38,800
 the real question is what next? Because there would be quite a few follow-up questions.

244
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,560
 At the top of the list will be questions about who these other beings are and what their

245
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,940
 agenda or agendas might be. This will be a very difficult question for any president

246
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,000
 to answer. In the first place, there is a likelihood

247
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,720
 that even the leaders of the black budget or breakaway society that have been on top

248
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,800
 of this for years, they may not even know. Or at least not fully. And what if they do

249
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,160
 know? And moreover, what if at least some of that answer includes information that might

250
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:15,120
 be upsetting? Divining the intentions of non-human visitors, or permanent residents, whatever

251
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,560
 they may be, might not be the easiest thing to do. But it's entirely possible, judging

252
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,640
 from the data we do have, that some of them may not care very much about humanity. Some

253
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,460
 may. Some may not. And what if an agenda has been determined within the intelligence community

254
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,840
 and this agenda includes something to do with alleged abduction phenomenon? And even if

255
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,100
 that isn't true, does any president honestly believe he or she can contain rampant speculation

256
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,840
 along these lines? And even if the intentions of these other beings are said to be neutral

257
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:57,860
 or positive, there will clearly be tremendous suspicion by large swaths of humanity. This

258
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:03,160
 will not be an easy sell. There will already be a sizable number of people predisposed

259
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,960
 to interpreting these other beings as nothing less than demonic, short of bringing one of

260
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,120
 these entities to a podium and subjecting it to hours and days and weeks of questions

261
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,800
 by an insatiable public. It's very likely that any moment of disclosure will not satisfy

262
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:27,120
 the public the way it would like to be regarding alien motivations. That's only the beginning

263
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,600
 of the problems. One early and obvious question that will arise, one which will have deep,

264
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,000
 profound political implications, will be very simple. How long have you managed to keep

265
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,880
 this secret all these years? Consider that our entire society has been told that UFOs

266
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,520
 do not represent anything truly anomalous, that ETs or aliens are definitely not here

267
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,600
 on earth interacting with us, that UFO believers may be well-meaning but had been mistaken

268
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:02,140
 about all of that. This has been a mindset embedded within all of our major institutions.

269
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,200
 Our educational institutions from primary school through universities and postdoctoral

270
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,080
 levels throughout our major news organizations in which an open belief in UFOs is a third

271
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,640
 rail for one's career, throughout our scientific establishment for sure and also throughout

272
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,040
 our political structure. Political careers have been destroyed or at least severely undermined

273
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:28,360
 by the UFO taint. Remember what happened to Dennis Kucinich in 2008 after it became known

274
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,000
 that many years before he had seen a UFO. Never mind the fact that the two witnesses

275
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,360
 he had been with came out and corroborated the sighting. They saw the same thing. All

276
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,080
 of these institutions and others have treated the UFO topic as nothing more than a joke,

277
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,920
 something suitable for immature minds. Can it really be that the professors throughout

278
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:56,120
 the United States uniformly have dismissed this phenomenon without any cooperation from

279
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:03,360
 the intelligence community? Ditto the world of science, politics and media. Well, no.

280
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,440
 Not when the most modest amount of research shows strong intelligence community influence

281
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,080
 over all of these institutions. In other words, people will see very clearly that the national

282
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,320
 security apparatus has created a global culture that has suffocated the truth. Researchers

283
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,700
 will begin to investigate in a serious way just how these relationships have undermined

284
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:31,780
 the credibility of all those institutions and undermined our apprehension of truth.

285
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:38,420
 The result will be a major cultural and institutional house cleaning, but it won't stop there.

286
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:43,160
 Investors will naturally want to know specifics about the structure of secrecy itself. That

287
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,420
 is, they will want to know if the U.S. president has been out of the loop all these years,

288
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:57,040
 as it seems, then who exactly has been in the loop? Who has been running the UFO cover-up?

289
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,000
 If the answer is anything along the lines of my own research so far, it will show that

290
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,200
 the cover-up has long ago gravitated away from formal presidential authority into international

291
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,960
 and private hands. It's not that the U.S. president is a non-player in all of this,

292
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,040
 but rather is more like the public face of the true power elite that stands behind. We

293
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,440
 all, I think, have come to understand this when it comes to power in general, and this

294
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,920
 will likely be the case when we begin a sophisticated analysis of UFO secrecy. In other words, the

295
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:37,640
 moment of disclosure will trigger an intellectual revolution worldwide relating to the true

296
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:44,000
 structure of power on planet Earth. It will be a moment in which the world sees and acknowledges

297
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,480
 that the emperor has been wearing nothing at all. The political fallout will be tremendous

298
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,400
 and a great battle will develop within the first year of disclosure. Think of it this

299
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,280
 way. Just because the president has been forced into making an announcement doesn't mean

300
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,360
 that the CIA and all the other intelligence groups that have been managing this will simply

301
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:11,080
 walk away. There has been a concerted effort spanning an entire human lifetime to control

302
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,600
 this topic. A great deal has been invested and mere disclosure is not going to change

303
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,960
 that. The real issue in the immediate post-disclosure world will be who controls the spin on the

304
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,920
 story, because right away there will be a great divide, a chasm. Once this topic is

305
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,440
 available for open discussion, you can be sure that people around the world will be

306
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,520
 demanding answers. You can be just as sure that on the other side of the fence information

307
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:44,360
 will be handed out as sparingly as possible. Government spin doctors will be out in great

308
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:50,520
 numbers trying to control the situation according to national security policy, although this

309
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:57,200
 time independent UFO searchers may get a public hearing that they hadn't gotten before. If

310
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,000
 the official spokespersons are making misleading or false statements, it's going to be a bit

311
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,400
 easier post-disclosure for independent researchers to point this out, because this time the world

312
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,840
 will be much more likely to listen. And there will be many, many more investigators into

313
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,800
 this topic after disclosure than there are today. How all that will turn out, only time

314
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:29,000
 will tell. There are so many other messy issues relating to global finance, energy, truth

315
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,200
 commissions, lawsuits, cultural transformations, cultural wars, religious and spiritual changes,

316
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,320
 scientific paradigm shifts, and ultimately geopolitical changes that will allow us to

317
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,040
 meet the challenge of, shall we call them others, here on planet Earth in some sort

318
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,860
 of coordinated, hopefully logical manner, and even more hopefully in some way that answers

319
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:01,040
 to the people rather than a handful of elite human players. And for that, we will need

320
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,680
 a groundswell of public pressure from below and tremendous political energy, ethics, and

321
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,000
 courage to take on the black budget culture that has dominated this subject for so long

322
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,720
 and to begin a long, hard fight to reclaim some measure of freedom and dignity for humanity

323
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,480
 while we begin a new, better, and more mature phase of our existence. Thank you.

324
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:42,120
 Thank you, Mr. Gollin. Now we'll go to our next witness, Daniel Sheehan, for 10 minutes.

325
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:50,760
 Good afternoon. Again, I point out that I'm speaking in this context as our general counsel

326
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:58,680
 here for this gathering and our meeting. And I do this in the context of having served

327
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,720
 as an attorney, as I pointed out in my initial comments on the first day we gathered, that

328
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:12,320
 I have for various reasons ended up being the attorney for a number of different issues

329
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,640
 having to do with attempting to uncover ongoing cover-ups. From the time that I served as

330
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,040
 one of the attorneys for the New York Times and the Pentagon Papers case, having seen

331
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:32,880
 the 47 volumes of the concealment of a policy that was completely contrary to what was being

332
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,560
 publicly professed and told to the Congress, in fact. And then I ended up being counsel

333
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:46,240
 in the Karen Silkwood case, uncovering the fact that our central intelligence agency

334
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,800
 was smuggling 98% pure bomb-grade plutonium to Israel, et cetera. I pointed out at the

335
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,720
 beginning of this conversation this week. And I pointed out that I ended up in the Iran

336
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,640
 Contra case as being the ones who, one of the ones that brought the information, attempted

337
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,660
 to bring it to Congress. And I want to point out here just at the very top of my conversation

338
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:15,580
 to repeat the reaction on the part of Peter Rodino, who was the chairman of the House Judiciary

339
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:22,000
 Committee at the time, when the information concerning the off-the-shelf self-financing

340
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,400
 covert operations enterprise that had been set up by the chief of covert operations for

341
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,800
 the central intelligence agency, Theodore Shackley, under George H.W. Bush, that when

342
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:41,100
 he was told this by Scott Armstrong, one of his trusted confidants, that Peter Rodino's

343
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:48,960
 response was, "My God, my God, Scott, I've been telling people for years that if they

344
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,000
 didn't like the way that our American policy was going, that they should write a letter

345
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,680
 to their congressperson. But if their congressperson did not respond, they should vote for someone

346
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:05,000
 else to be their congressperson. But if what you're telling me here is true, why then we

347
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,120
 haven't even been in charge? I'm not going to allow the United States Congress to investigate

348
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:18,800
 anything like that." Now, that's an absolute quote from Peter Rodino as the chairman of

349
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,280
 the Judiciary Committee. This had only to do with the fact that there was a covert operation

350
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,840
 going on attempting to supply military equipment to the Contras. Now, what we're dealing with

351
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:37,400
 here is we've come full circle during the course of this week. We've discovered that

352
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,120
 the three major questions that have been in front of us, that being that what in the world

353
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:49,320
 is going on here with this phenomenon of so-called unidentified flying objects or the flying

354
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:56,800
 saucers themselves when we move beyond the unidentified nature of them, and these beings

355
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,480
 that seem to be associated with these vehicles that have been seen on a number of occasions.

356
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,240
 That's one of the big major questions. The second major question is, "Well, who in the

357
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,560
 world is it that knows what the answer to this question is?" Since so many of the government

358
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:19,880
 officials don't seem to know, yourselves included, one of the extraordinary events of the week

359
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:28,920
 has been watching the transition take place from six of our trusted and long-time representatives

360
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,360
 actually coming to discover that the information that actually exists about this is extraordinary

361
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,160
 and very detailed. It addresses the issue of the radar sightings. It addresses the issues

362
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:47,280
 of all the questions that have been asked, and it comes to an observation that not only

363
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,080
 does the Congress not know about this, but many people throughout the executive branch

364
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:58,320
 don't know about this. This question of who is it that does know about this, or is there

365
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,520
 anybody that knows about this? What we have heard over and over again in the testimony

366
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,760
 is that there are many pieces of evidence that indicate that this is known about, that

367
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,880
 there was an agency set up by President Truman shortly after the discovery of the crash site

368
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,080
 at Roswell in 1947, the Majestic 12 group. There's been clear testimony that I believe

369
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:28,120
 is credible, would be credible in a court of law, that this organization has for various

370
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:33,320
 reasons taken this issue out from under the oversight of our Congress, out from under

371
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:41,440
 the control of our executive branch, and has taken this into a realm of semi-private control.

372
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,280
 What you'll notice is as we come to the last panel of our week together here, the issue

373
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:53,000
 tends to turn more and more to that issue. What has happened to our country when a national

374
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,940
 security state seems to have arisen to conceal certain types of information from our people,

375
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:05,560
 from our congressional representatives, even from some of our presidents. That question

376
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:13,880
 seems to be in front of us right now, attempting to understand the nature of this elite group.

377
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,560
 What we want to do also is face the third question, is that when you get past these

378
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,180
 procedural questions to the ultimate question of who are these beings, what are the implications

379
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:32,120
 for our human family if we are, in fact, at a point of some rather dramatic transition.

380
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:39,240
 I believe that what we're going to be experiencing in the very near future has been foreshadowed,

381
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,940
 as I mentioned earlier, by the positions being taken by the Catholic Church and the Vatican,

382
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,960
 that they are very clearly attempting to move into a position of utilizing the increasing

383
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,600
 discovery of more and more planets on which they are more and more confident that life

384
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:03,140
 is going to be discovered and that they're going to eventually not only recognize that

385
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:09,440
 at least microscopic life has been discovered, but that a civilization has been discovered

386
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,640
 and they're going to begin by pointing out that it's okay because they're very far away.

387
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,300
 We've discovered them, we've found the information, but they're very far away and they're going

388
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,620
 to engage in a process of feathering this consciousness into our people and that they're

389
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:30,580
 only then going to point out that this civilization seems to be a highly developed technological

390
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:39,040
 civilization and we will then reveal the existence of communication mechanisms that we have developed

391
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,320
 whereby we can have a longer range diplomatic type of negotiation with this civilization.

392
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:52,160
 They're going to say let's not turn to the past, let's not reflect upon all this information

393
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,600
 and evidence that's been around for a long time that they seem to be here, we've known

394
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,920
 about it, there's been concealment about this, there may be concealment of certain technology

395
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:07,400
 that they've made, we had available to us, just as was said by the Obama administration,

396
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:13,200
 let's not look back at George W. Bush's administration, let's not review the question of the torture

397
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,800
 and the lying to the Congress of the United States to get us involved in this, let's not

398
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,520
 do that, let's look forward and be constructive, that's how we're all trained and what I'm

399
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,640
 saying is that I think we've come to try to share some of that consciousness here this

400
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,120
 week, what can we do to look forward to this and that's why the resolution has been put

401
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:39,160
 forth here to try to reach out and have a set of conferences sponsored by the United

402
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,480
 Nations General Assembly start to reveal this information so we can participate in this

403
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:52,580
 to avoid a dialectical confrontation between the people of our country and this national

404
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,400
 security state apparatus, some of the details of which have been pointed out here in our

405
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:04,640
 final panel and I share in that wish to have this done constructively and peacefully and

406
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,760
 I believe that we can do that and I believe that you as members, former members of Congress

407
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,940
 recently retired, the reality is that if the six of you go and sit down with various people

408
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,840
 in Congress, not to expect that they're going to change overnight and say oh look, let's

409
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,680
 have a hearing on this and expose it to our people, but the fact that you have come to

410
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:32,480
 discover just this week so much more than you ever knew was going on, that you are experts

411
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,180
 at trying to share this information with people in your regions of the country and we have

412
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:42,880
 from all different parts of the country, from Alaska to California to other states of our

413
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,180
 country, right, in the south of our country and in the midwest of our country, we can,

414
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:54,440
 if you will reach out and try to talk with your people in your own districts about this

415
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:02,000
 issue to take upon yourself that risk of the potential ridicule, the potential criticism,

416
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,120
 the question you've been asking yourself, all of you, what am I going to do now? What

417
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,080
 am I going to do now that I have left the Congress? Am I going to continue to represent

418
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:17,000
 the people in my district? Am I going to attempt to educate them? Because if you have come

419
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,320
 to the same conclusion that I came to when I was given the privilege of representing

420
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,120
 Dr. John Mack, if you've come to the same conclusion that I have, this is one of the

421
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,680
 most important issues that you've ever encountered in your life and you are the most skilled

422
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:36,880
 people to go and share this with your own constituency and reach out and help us. That's

423
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,440
 what we're asking for you to do.

424
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:52,440
 Thank you for your statement, Mr. Chan. We'll now begin the questioning of our witnesses

425
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,000
 and we're going to change the order. We're going to start with Dr. Bookman and we're

426
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,600
 just going to work our way down this way.

427
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,000
 Mr. Dolan, we've had this conversation before and I think it might be helpful to the committee

428
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,360
 too. How many crashes do you find credible, roughly?

429
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,600
 I've never bothered to tally them up. There are a couple of very good book studies that

430
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:22,700
 have been done, one by a gentleman who's here, Dr. Kevin Randle, another by Ryan Wood.

431
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,360
 How many do your colleagues generally, as you look at their materials, have you concluded?

432
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,800
 I don't think 10 would be outrageous.

433
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:36,700
 Maybe 10 craft have been recovered, 10 crashes. Let's talk about those 10. We assume that

434
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:42,640
 we're not the most enlightened, caring, loving folk in the galaxy, I gather. Is there any

435
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:49,880
 evidence that the colleagues of these crashed extraterrestrials have come looking for them

436
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,360
 or attempted to recover their crash technology or their brothers and sisters who might have

437
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,280
 been held in captivity, no matter how comfortable here?

438
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,320
 All we're dealing with are leaks and more leaks and stories and claims. It would not

439
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:08,160
 be illogical. There have been claims that have been made proving these, getting corroboration

440
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,960
 is another story.

441
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,400
 Thank you.

442
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,880
 Yes, Representative Willsies.

443
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:22,240
 Thank you. I think we should shorten this as best we can, except for the Honorable Paul

444
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:31,640
 Heller. One thing I'd like to say to Paul Heller is, I think we know the answer about

445
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:40,600
 who knows about this, when you two guys brought it up. I think Mr. Heller answered it for

446
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:52,680
 us. It's the three sisters. I mean, they know of the industrial complexes, the oil cabal,

447
00:47:52,680 --> 00:48:05,080
 the banking cabal. They know. They've been controlling this for a long time. We know

448
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:10,640
 they know, and we know they've been controlling it, so our question is now, what do we do

449
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,120
 about it? I don't think it does a lot of good to go out and insult the people that are going

450
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:28,200
 to have to do something about it, but we can do more than we're doing. We have to get money

451
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:36,600
 out of politics, one. I don't mean control the press, what they can see. We have to expand

452
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:47,220
 the press so that three or five corporations don't own the communications in our country.

453
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:53,760
 We have to do something about our education system so that our students graduate knowing

454
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,080
 how to question, staying in school in the first place, but they have to learn how to

455
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,800
 question. They have to learn how to analyze. They have to make decisions that are in their

456
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,160
 own best interests, not in the best interests of the top 1% of the wealthiest people in

457
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:18,680
 this country. We have to have economic justice. I mean, there's so much that we have to do

458
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:28,800
 in this country. If we had a country that was not based on money and had a press that

459
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:37,000
 would speak truth to power and uneducated public, we'd be demanding and wanting to hear

460
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,160
 everything that I heard this week from all of you. It isn't there, it isn't happening,

461
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:53,400
 and we just do, I mean, we have so much work to do. I mean, and then the question of, well,

462
00:49:53,400 --> 00:50:03,080
 my question is, what would it look like, why would it be upsetting to get this information

463
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,760
 out? What does upsetting information look like?

464
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:15,200
 Well, Ms. Wilsey, if I might have something to say on that. I had a conversation with

465
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:25,240
 a gentleman who I will just say is of absolutely impeccable credentials who told me of his

466
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,760
 personal knowledge of a briefing that was given to President Jimmy Carter back in June

467
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,240
 of 1977 on exactly this matter. Now, he doesn't know the details of what was said, but he

468
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,020
 does know that it was a briefing about the extraterrestrial presence. This was in June

469
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:49,080
 of 1977, the beginning of his first year. And at the end of that meeting, the President

470
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:56,920
 was seen with his head in his hands, elbows on the desk, and weeping or deeply upset.

471
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:03,360
 Something was told to him that was very upsetting. I asked this individual if he had any idea

472
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:12,080
 what it was. He did not bother to speculate. But I will say that I have another gentleman

473
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:20,160
 who was a senior cabinet member in the first Reagan administration, who similarly told

474
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:27,920
 of being taken for several weeks after he got his job to an underground facility to

475
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:34,720
 receive a briefing and was deeply upset because, as he said to a trusted family member, I have

476
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:42,880
 a daughter and I am terrified for her. So there is something going on in which this

477
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:50,920
 phenomenon is either threatening or we might speculate beyond the control of the political

478
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:58,880
 powers that are officially representing us. Well, it is beyond control. It is the three

479
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:08,720
 sisters that are running it. So thank you. Thank you. And let's go to a representative

480
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,440
 from Maryland. Thank you very much. I want to, for a few

481
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:21,680
 moments dwell a bit on a problem that was mentioned by both Mr. Hillier and Dr. Bookman.

482
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:30,920
 That is the constitutional issue here. For the moment, we are the undisputed economic

483
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:38,840
 and military superpower in the world. We are a bit less than 5% of the world's population.

484
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:45,160
 We are about one person out of 22 in the world. And we have just about, we represent about

485
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,680
 a fourth of the world's economy, which means we have about a fourth of all the good things

486
00:52:49,680 --> 00:53:01,000
 in the world. How come? How come? We no longer have the best work ethic in the world. All

487
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 you have to do is drive around and watch for people bending their back and sweating and

488
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,560
 working. You won't see very many white faces. You don't see very many black faces. You see

489
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:16,120
 Hispanic faces. We no longer have the most respect for the nuclear family. This year,

490
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:23,080
 almost half our babies will be born out of wedlock. We no longer have the most respect

491
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:30,640
 for technical education. This year, the Chinese will graduate seven times as many engineering

492
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:39,360
 students as we graduate. How is it then that we are so darn fortunate that we are the undisputed

493
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:48,240
 economic and military superpower in the world? I think it's because of our enormous respect.

494
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,600
 And we have a fourth of all the good things in the world. I think it's our enormous respect

495
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:57,720
 for civil liberties. There's no other constitution. There's no other bill of rights to protect

496
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:03,280
 civil liberties like ours. And I think, by the way, you've mentioned it, gentlemen. We

497
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:10,240
 are not a democracy. We are a democratic process. But we are a republic, Benjamin Franklin asked.

498
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:16,680
 There's a fundamental difference there. There's a fundamental difference there. I'm very concerned

499
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:24,520
 that because our government today so easily ignores the constitution to do what they think

500
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:32,440
 are good things, that tomorrow, like some of the functions of our government that I think

501
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:39,840
 are extra constitutional, if not unconstitutional, like ignoring the First Amendment requirement

502
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,880
 that the citizens have a right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

503
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:50,200
 And there's a grievance that there's not been a hearing on this for a very long time.

504
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:56,560
 If the government can ignore the constitution to be good things today, tomorrow they can

505
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:03,000
 ignore the constitution to do bad things. Other countries have done it.

506
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,760
 When my ex-chief of staff, who is now my colleague, called me and asked me if I was interested

507
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:14,560
 in this and warned me that there was a big probability that a lot of people would relegate

508
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:20,800
 me to the lunatic fringe for coming here. I told her that the primary reason that I

509
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:27,560
 would come was that there's a serious constitutional issue here. The citizens have a right for

510
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,120
 their government to tell them what's going on here. And I want to thank both of you for

511
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,680
 bringing up this constitutional issue because I think it is a very serious one. A government

512
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:41,760
 which ignores the constitution to do good things today, what they think are good things

513
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,320
 today, can ignore the constitution to do bad things tomorrow because it will rationalize

514
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:52,800
 that they are good things tomorrow. So thank you very much for your shared concern of this

515
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,800
 issue.

516
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,800
 [Applause]

517
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:05,480
 Senator, we've got five minutes for questions. You'll have five minutes for questions and

518
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:11,920
 then whatever time afterwards we'll start with you on closing states.

519
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:19,560
 What I'd like to do is ask Minister Heller, we all talk about the problem. In fact, that's

520
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,920
 all I hear is defining the problem. We've got to think in terms of solutions. What's

521
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,920
 your solution to the problem?

522
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:35,600
 You have got problems. Wall Street runs your economy. And the military, if you elect a

523
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:41,880
 president who is presumably commander in chief of the armed forces, but he's not clear to

524
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:47,360
 know what the troops in his command are actually doing. So I think, you know, there are some

525
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,760
 big problems. But I think Congress ultimately has the key to both the future of the United

526
00:56:52,760 --> 00:57:01,640
 States and of the world. And this is what bothers me because they're not exercising

527
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:07,040
 their power to change the things that have to be changed. But if you'll indulge me, I'd

528
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:14,800
 like to read two pages from advice from the extraterrestrials. And I think they've got

529
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,640
 a lot of good advice because they know what's going on more than we do sometimes. This is

530
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:25,200
 a quote from Jim Sparks, who was probably the most abducted of all the people who have

531
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:34,040
 been abducted. And he was taken away one night late on. He'd been abducted dozens of times

532
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:42,040
 before that. And he said, I found myself standing in that abandoned carnival park, clearheaded

533
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:47,560
 and fully conscious. There were those creatures again. And I could see that their holograms

534
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:52,560
 of human faces were cast over their faces to disguise their true appearance and make

535
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,800
 me feel less apprehensive. I noticed that each alien seemed to be concentrating and

536
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,320
 communicating or transmitting its thoughts to the creature to my left. They seemed to

537
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:09,720
 be of like mind as though combining their consciousness into one telepathic voice. They

538
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:16,360
 continue. And now this is quoting the ETs. There are some things you need to understand.

539
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:22,440
 Yes, it's true that we have been in contact with your government and heads of power. It

540
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:29,640
 is also true that agreements have been made and kept secret from your people. It is also

541
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:35,560
 true that in the past some of your people have lost their lives or have been badly hurt

542
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:43,800
 to protect the secret. Our hands had no part in this. We contacted your leaders because

543
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,440
 your planet is in grave trouble. Your leaders said the vast majority of your population

544
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:56,440
 wasn't ready for anything like us yet. So we made time agreements with your leaders

545
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:02,760
 as to when your people would be made aware of our presence. That part of the agreement

546
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,880
 has not at all been kept. It was also agreed that in the meantime, steps would be taken

547
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,640
 to correct the environmental conditions of your planet with our advice and technology.

548
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:23,320
 We say "advice" because we respect the fact that this is your planet, not ours. They also

549
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:31,320
 broke that agreement. This is Jim now. I felt an awful wave of emotion from them, the feeling

550
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:38,720
 of abandonment. To feel any emotion from them at all was amazing, but this was quite overwhelming.

551
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:45,960
 You aren't giving up on us, are you? I asked. There was a long silent pause, and I received

552
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:53,320
 the transmitted feeling of tremendous loss. Well, are you? I asked. No. I felt an immediate

553
00:59:53,320 --> 01:00:01,040
 sense of relief straight from my own emotions. But then the extraterrestrials again, your

554
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:09,920
 air, your water are contaminated. Your forests, jungles, trees and plant life are dying. There

555
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,800
 are several breaks in your food chain. You have an overwhelming amount of nuclear and

556
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:22,240
 biological weapons, which include nuclear and biological contamination. Your planet

557
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:31,240
 is overpopulated. Warning, it is almost to the point of being too late, unless your people

558
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:38,160
 act. There are better ways of deriving energy and food needs without causing your planet

559
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:45,120
 any damage. Those in power are aware of this and have the capability of putting these methods

560
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:52,400
 into worldwide use. I let this digest for a moment. I definitely had the feeling that

561
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:58,560
 these creatures are speaking as one. Then I asked, why aren't we doing that now? Silence.

562
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:03,960
 I was willing to wait. I had come a long way to be treated like this by them to have this

563
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:10,000
 kind of meeting. Apparently I had earned their respect and trust. The best part was that

564
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,560
 I was getting direct truthful answers to my questions. I decided that I would milk this

565
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:19,680
 rare situation to its fullest, asking as many questions as I could get away with, even personal

566
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:26,240
 ones. I repeated my question and they answered. Those in power view it as a military and security

567
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:32,800
 threat. That upset me. You mean to tell me that the people in power have the ability

568
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:42,340
 to save and better the planet and they aren't doing it? Amnesty. What do you mean? Complete

569
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:48,960
 amnesty to those in power, governments and leaders who have been suppressing the truth,

570
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,240
 that they can't be held liable for any past wrong deeds. It is the only way these leaders

571
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:02,400
 can come forward with the truth. It is necessary that you do this in order to work together

572
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,400
 and survive.

573
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:16,320
 I think that's wonderful advice straight from the ECPS wheels. I think Congress should exercise

574
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:23,800
 its power. I know that they've got some job owning, but they have the ultimate power.

575
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:31,600
 They could say to the junta, "We want you to do this. We'll give you amnesty, protection.

576
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:39,000
 We want you to do this and you're going to do it. If you don't, we'll cut your funding

577
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,800
 off except for salaries and wages until you do do it." Because it's in the national interest

578
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:51,520
 and it's in the world interest. We want to know what's going on and specifically we want

579
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:58,800
 the energy sources to put into effect to save the world before it's too darn late.

580
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:12,760
 Thank you very much. We'll start the closing statements by Senator -- well, is there a

581
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,760
 --

582
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,760
 As much as you want.

583
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,760
 Yeah, you get your closing statement.

584
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,200
 Don't ever say that to me. I filibuster.

585
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,760
 I should have warned Dr. Buckman about that, but anyway, go ahead.

586
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,320
 I'll be reasonable. I'll put it that way.

587
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:33,920
 First off, if I've sounded angry, I apologize for that, but there's a reason. I am angry,

588
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:41,720
 very angry, but I really want to point out that I love my country. I'm very critical

589
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:49,480
 of it because it needs to be criticized heavily. I consider myself a patriot, but I don't buy

590
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:56,520
 into -- but first and foremost, and I used to end a lot of my speeches and I lasted for

591
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:02,120
 12 years, I am a citizen of the planet first and American second, and my priorities are

592
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:06,840
 on that way. Make no mistake about that.

593
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:16,240
 Now, when we're analyzing the problem, whether it's the extraterrestrial situation issue

594
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:22,080
 or the 9/11 issue, which of course ginned up the ability of the crazies to really go

595
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:30,320
 after the world, we have to start and be a little humble and say, hey, those of us that

596
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,620
 have held office for a period of time, it's during that period of time that things have

597
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,880
 gone to hell, and when people say, well, we ought to take back our country, we never had

598
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:50,240
 our country, if you read the Constitution, it was passed in '87 and '89, the first -- we

599
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:57,680
 were putting in slavery for infinity, and if you look at -- and those of you that have

600
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:04,880
 this brochure, you'll look at all of our forebears that said the people should have the right

601
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,520
 to change their government, and that's based upon the Declaration of Independence where

602
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:16,080
 all human beings are created equal. Well, 12 years later, they're in Philadelphia,

603
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,280
 and they're not creating all human beings equal. What they're doing is they're making

604
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:26,560
 a distinction that white males are the only equal ones, and if you have enough property,

605
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:31,760
 the rest, and so those who get married to the Constitution, they like to rip the Constitution

606
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:38,760
 apart, and then when you say about, you know, obeying the Constitution, after the Civil

607
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:44,660
 War amendments, which really is the only improvement made in the Constitution of size because it

608
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:49,960
 expanded the franchise, and if you look at the amendments, the rest of it are just housekeeping,

609
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:57,120
 and so from the Civil War on, we had 90 years where, what, 12, 13 states were in total violation

610
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:01,980
 of the Constitution of the United States, and nobody gave a darn about it, and the political

611
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:08,980
 parties were all part of the conspiracy. So when you advance from there to here and

612
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:17,680
 look around and see how our scientific advancement has been so explosive, and we are stuck in

613
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:23,240
 a system, a structure of governance that's 250 years old that is totally irrelevant to

614
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:28,160
 dealing with our problems that we face today, and then so we look at, say, oh, we're going

615
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,120
 to go to the Congress. I got to tell you, I've said that earlier in the week. It's a

616
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:37,480
 dead letter, and hold your breath. It's never going to happen, and it's not that I'm demeaning

617
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:43,720
 the Congress. I've been there, and I'll tell you that they don't have the power that you

618
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:51,960
 think they have. I don't want to engage in anything. I respect your views, but I just

619
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:57,720
 want to tell you that the problem, you have to come to some kind of a search internally

620
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:05,080
 with some humility and say, maybe, just maybe, our structure of governance is deficient,

621
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:11,800
 is deficient. We don't have a democracy, never had it. What we have is representative government.

622
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:17,240
 That's what came out of the Age of Enlightenment, was representative government, where the majority

623
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:23,560
 of the people give their power away to a small minority, and that small minority, and you

624
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:30,120
 want to know what happened, $4 billion was spent in the last election in our government,

625
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:37,080
 the Congress, the executive, the bureaucracy, the judiciary. They are owned, locked, stocked,

626
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:44,440
 and barreled by the Wall Street, the military industrial complex, and all the special interests

627
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:50,520
 that we find abroad. Then when you see what's going on with NATO is nothing but the militarization,

628
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:55,520
 the globalization of the military industrial complex. That's what's going on. I referred

629
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:01,420
 to a study where it showed that 1,300 corporations with interlocking directorates and family

630
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:07,360
 ties own 60% of the wealth of the world. Then you've gone through the litany of the Bilderberg

631
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:14,000
 group and all of that group. Sure, they do what's natural to them. They've got power,

632
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
 and they're clever enough to keep it and work for it. Our task is to look at the structure

633
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,840
 of why we're failing as human beings. I say all of us, because we've had testimony replete

634
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:32,160
 of people in the military who are supposed to be courageous and prepared to charge up

635
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:39,040
 the hill, that they defer to authority that silences them. If you reason it out, it doesn't

636
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,240
 make any sense that they have to keep secrets like that. I had to make that decision in

637
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:48,240
 the Senate and put myself at risk when releasing the Pentagon papers. Those were top secret

638
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:54,500
 documents. The rest of the Congress was stymied like little kids in school that you could

639
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,160
 go read it, but you couldn't take any notes. They tried to impeach me, and I was saved

640
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:05,760
 by one person, Mike Mansfield. He had such power in the Senate. He stepped before a delegation

641
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:10,880
 led by Gerald Ford, brought it with Hugh Scott, went to visit him and said, "Well, we've

642
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,040
 got to deal with this Gravel for what he's done," and Mansfield turned to him, sucking

643
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,640
 on his pipe. He says, "He's done nothing that I know of," and they walked right out.

644
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:25,040
 That was the end of the story. That saved my career. When I went to see Mansfield, and

645
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,080
 I get emotional about it, because what he turned to me says, "Mike, if I had had your

646
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:33,720
 courage, I would have done the same thing," but stop and think what I did. The whole Congress

647
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:40,500
 had bought into the secrecy of these documents, and I had turned it all over and made the

648
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:48,400
 Supreme Court moot and put to shame the newspapers that were now afraid to do it, and the issue

649
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:57,720
 with the Supreme Court. Our government, representative government, is designed to keep the people

650
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:03,960
 in civic adolescence. That's what it's designed. What is adolescence? "Oh, I want that, but

651
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,660
 I don't want to pay any taxes. I want that, but I don't want to pay any taxes." That's

652
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:15,720
 adolescent behavior. Now, how do we bring the people to adulthood, civic adulthood?

653
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:21,400
 We do it the way we bring our children up. We give our children responsibility as they

654
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:26,680
 age, and then they come to adulthood. It's taking responsibility, but when you have a

655
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:32,640
 structure of government that doesn't permit the people to take responsibility, you guarantee

656
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:38,560
 the continuation of civic adolescence. What I've tried to do with this work, and this

657
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:45,400
 represents the last 25 years of my public life, and it will continue until the day I

658
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:53,080
 die, and that is that the answer is the people. It's not your leaders. Don't trust your leaders.

659
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:58,720
 It's the people. There's only two venues for change. One is the government, wherein structurally

660
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:04,900
 the problem exists, and the other is the people. The government won't, but the people can't

661
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:13,800
 because they give their power away. I'll close on one quote which says it all, and that

662
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:25,960
 is very simple. It's a quote from 2,000 years ago. Marcus Cicero defined freedom as participation

663
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:35,360
 in power. You will never, never see fundamental change in our society or global society until

664
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:43,040
 the power can be relegated to the people directly. It's just that simple. I make that as a prediction.

665
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:49,520
 I've resigned myself that I'll keep working, but I won't see this in my lifetime. Won't

666
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,400
 see it in my lifetime, but someday people are going to wake up and say, "Hey, what's

667
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:02,960
 so worrisome about empowering the people to be able to do what?" When Cicero says freedom

668
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:09,640
 is power, is participation in power, what is the central power of all governments, whether

669
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:17,320
 tyrannies or democracy or republics? It's the ability to make laws that stand outside

670
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:23,900
 of ourselves and that we're supposed to obey them. At this point in time, only representatives

671
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:30,760
 make laws, and these representatives de facto are controlled by these forces beyond our

672
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:37,840
 control because they control society. The answer is to find a way to empower people

673
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:46,140
 to be able to make laws. Therefore, they will have the power to do away with the secrecy

674
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:53,280
 in government. Does it surprise you that 50% of the people don't even care about government?

675
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:58,600
 This is not Einstein's theory. Well, it is Einstein's theory. He said that to repeat

676
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,720
 over and over again something that doesn't work is the definition of insanity. That's

677
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:08,040
 a great theory. We vote for Democrats, nothing really happens. We vote for Republicans, nothing

678
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:12,920
 really happens. We go to Britain, we see one government, that government, nothing really

679
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:21,400
 happens to advance the needs of the human race. You can only come to one conclusion

680
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:28,680
 that the answer is not with the elites. They manipulate our elections. Mind you, I raise

681
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:35,600
 money from special sources to run for office, and I manipulate my constituency. I do that.

682
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,680
 I'm sure any successful politician has done that, is to manipulate the constituency for

683
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:47,560
 your thinking. To think that we in elective office want a turnout of voters, hell no.

684
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:53,720
 We want a turnout of our voters, not the general voters. The whole structure of representative

685
01:13:53,720 --> 01:14:02,000
 government is very deficient. Let me lead with this, that I have personally unreserved

686
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:09,360
 faith in the people. If you don't have faith in the people, what do you have faith in?

687
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:15,700
 The leaders, and that's exactly where we're at today. If you want to see this issue of

688
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:20,720
 being able to maturely, and I don't think we have close to the maturity to deal with

689
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:28,560
 the extraterrestrials. We're told, and I'll accept that, that we have the scientific ability

690
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:36,800
 to send ET home. Well, it's being sequestered away from the people, and that's a tragedy

691
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:42,280
 because there's a lot more out there that could benefit the human race, but we can't

692
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:47,440
 get our hands on it because we don't have the structure of governance to be able to

693
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:53,200
 go at it. Let me close on it. If those of you that don't have this, you can go to our

694
01:14:53,200 --> 01:15:02,480
 website, National Citizens Initiative for Democracy. Hopefully, it won't succeed in my lifetime,

695
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:08,360
 but it is my contribution and a legacy. Forget the Pentagon Papers, forget the nuclear critique,

696
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:13,400
 forget the end of the draft. This is the contribution that I think is worthwhile, and I won't live

697
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:42,680
 to see it. Thank you very much. If you will get in your car, and it'll be

698
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:48,140
 a little more spectacular in the wintertime because the air is thinner and it holds less

699
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:57,560
 moisture, and if you will drive out of the city away from the lights and away from the

700
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:01,480
 air pollution, and you drive up a mountain several thousand feet, you don't have to go

701
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:09,640
 very far to do that. A hundred miles in West Virginia will do it, and on a cloudless winter

702
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:17,800
 night you look up into the sky. You will just be astounded at the Milky Way. Wow, it looks

703
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:25,360
 like they took a whitewash brush across the sky. There are so darn many stars there, more

704
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:32,680
 than a billion. And then when you recognize that our star is a pretty mediocre star in

705
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:39,800
 this galaxy of the Milky Way, and then when you know that there are probably a billion

706
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:50,800
 other galaxies this size. You know, as a scientist, there just has to be another sun out there,

707
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,120
 another star, and another planet that has characteristics appropriate for the development

708
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:04,320
 of life. And I think you have to be very arrogant and very presumptive to believe that we're

709
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:11,600
 the only civilization in the universe, and the most advanced civilization. Wow, we're

710
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:17,600
 still killing each other in stupid wars, and not all that long ago, I'm Anglo-Saxon, German,

711
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:26,280
 and my forebears were wearing skins in a stone age running around Europe. As I mentioned

712
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:32,400
 earlier when my chief of staff, with whom I now work, said that I was invited to come

713
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:38,320
 here and warn me that you might be ridiculed for it, I told her that I was going to come

714
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:44,840
 because of the constitutional issue for no other, which I mentioned. Because if your

715
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:50,800
 government can rationalize that it's okay to deny you this hearing for your good, tomorrow

716
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,800
 they can be doing a lot of things that are very hurtful to you, because in the grand

717
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:02,320
 scheme of things, they will rationalize that it's for your good. Thank you very much, those

718
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:08,160
 of you who organized this. I've really been privileged to be here. I'm honored that you

719
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:14,480
 invited me to come. And thank you to the witnesses. And I think back through these five days and

720
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:23,320
 the witnesses have come, some of them at considerable personal price. And a special thanks to those

721
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:31,400
 who have borne this secret for 40, 50 years, and now near their deathbed, come forward

722
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:39,640
 so that we can know. I ask myself why this cloak of secrecy? Clearly there is a cloak

723
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:44,840
 of secrecy. And I ask myself why. My wife says that I'm the eternal optimist. And I'd

724
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:52,320
 like to think the best of everybody until proven different. And so I want to believe

725
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:57,640
 that those who made decisions were patriotic Americans, believing that at the time they

726
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:05,320
 made the decision which was in the best interest of their country. This was just a few years

727
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:11,840
 after the War of the Worlds thing where the East Coast was panicked when they thought

728
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:19,560
 we were being invaded by extraterrestrials. And that was one concern that I think they

729
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:25,800
 must have had that was fairly recent in their memory. Another concern would be, gee, there

730
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:31,960
 really is some advanced technology here, isn't there? And wouldn't it be tragic if the Soviets

731
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:40,160
 had that rather than us or shared it with us? And so I think for these two reasons they

732
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:45,840
 could very well have rationalized it. And that decision was made very early. Apparently

733
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,840
 it may have gone clear to the office of the president because within a few hours after

734
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:56,880
 they issued that press release that said that a flying saucer had crashed, they came with

735
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,600
 this ridiculous press release saying, gee, it was just a balloon. We goofed. But they

736
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:09,280
 did send what they found to Wright Field and they did send a number of people out to vacuum

737
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:16,480
 the area for several days. These three things alone tell me that the Air Force knows that

738
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:33,600
 they're not telling us the truth. I hope that after 60-odd years of known incidents

739
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:39,360
 after the Soviet Union has gone that these two justifications they recognized are no

740
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:46,140
 longer valid and that they might come and tell the American people there is something

741
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:54,000
 out there that we can't explain. And we're sorry that for all these years that we rationalized

742
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,340
 that it was the national interest of our country to keep this from you. I may be the eternal

743
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:03,160
 optimist but I'd like to thank the best of people. Again, thank you so very much for

744
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:17,320
 putting this on. Thank you for honoring me to be a part of it. Thank you.

745
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:23,620
 I certainly want to thank everybody that's been involved in this whole operation this

746
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:34,160
 week and I just want to say how grateful I am for being contacted and asked to participate

747
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:43,040
 and how glad I am that I accepted this opportunity to be on this panel. But I want to focus my

748
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:55,460
 closing statement and keep it very short on the witnesses. I still can't believe the quality

749
01:21:55,460 --> 01:22:04,540
 of the witnesses that we've seen this week has been about 40, about 40. This is meant

750
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:12,700
 as a total compliment. I can't, when I contemplated coming here to Washington for this, I certainly

751
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:20,000
 couldn't imagine that you could assemble in one conference that number of people with

752
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:30,860
 that level of capability, competence, commitment, and intelligence. The witnesses are far better

753
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:36,080
 than I think anyone of us had a right to expect when we accepted this. And maybe it's because

754
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:48,420
 I don't know enough about ufology. And Congressman, there is five more behind every one of those

755
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:54,140
 40 that can come forward just as strong. I'm starting to have no doubt about that at all

756
01:22:54,140 --> 01:23:03,340
 after hearing just a small sampling of pilots and controllers and people on the ground that

757
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:12,900
 have seen things and witnessed things. And the integrity and believability, honesty,

758
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:22,140
 and clear thought of each of these testimonies was something to behold. I have to say that.

759
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:27,060
 I'm just very impressed on that. And I'm going to conclude the remarks by saying to all of

760
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:33,700
 the witnesses and each and every one witness, if you're a researcher, you keep on researching

761
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:39,740
 and redouble those research efforts. If you're someone in the media that's trying to understand

762
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:47,700
 this and help promote it, work harder at it. And if, I mean, you're doing a good job, don't

763
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:57,940
 get me wrong, but I just want you to redouble this. Because, you know, if it's true, I've

764
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:02,300
 announced before I even came here that I believe in extraterrestrial life. And that was from

765
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:10,540
 a religious standpoint. So I've been focusing on scientific evidence of it. And let me just

766
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:17,680
 say this. I'm like, sorry the name slips through me, but the person that used to be the minister

767
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:26,260
 of, or in the Ministry of Defense, Nick Pope. I'm like Dick Pope. I haven't come to a definite

768
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:36,100
 scientific conclusion on that question. But I hope in the short lifetime I have left,

769
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:49,860
 I can, based on science. And if you researchers will redouble the efforts and if anybody that

770
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:58,340
 can help fund and resource this kind of effort can get committed and get going, because hey,

771
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:06,460
 I can tell you this must have cost some real money, what you've done here. And that's a

772
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:11,640
 compliment to the fundraising skill that you obviously all have that have been involved.

773
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:20,180
 So I'd just like to end with this final sentence. Keep working hard. Use this as just kind of

774
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:22,980
 a springboard to redoubling your efforts. Thank you very much.

775
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:41,340
 Well, I want to thank my colleagues and thanks for putting this group of six together. It

776
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:49,660
 could not have been better balanced. It was balanced politically. It was balanced gender-wise,

777
01:25:49,660 --> 01:26:02,820
 absolutely. And it was balanced with our beliefs. And it's so clear. People say we don't get

778
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:14,500
 along. We get along. And when you take the politics out of it, it makes it a lot easier.

779
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:21,700
 And I will say what we say in the Congress when we want to save time, is that I echo

780
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:30,100
 our chairman's viewpoint on the witnesses. He said it perfectly. The knowledge, the experience,

781
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:37,380
 and the integrity of this group of witnesses made it such an important week for me and

782
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:48,100
 I know for many others. Actually, with this amazing group of witnesses that we heard,

783
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:55,260
 and as we talked about this subject, it made it absolutely impossible for me to remain

784
01:26:55,260 --> 01:27:14,420
 a skeptic. But I don't believe that it's about -- I don't believe it's about belief.

785
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:24,500
 I believe this whole situation is about information. And the existence of UFOs and ETs is becoming

786
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:30,340
 accepted worldwide. And the information we received was so important to support that

787
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:38,260
 and defend it. But it's time for our government, the U.S. government, to come to the party.

788
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:47,500
 It's time for our government to declassify and disclose what they know. And it is time

789
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:55,180
 that they trust the people of this country, that they can handle this information, whatever

790
01:27:55,180 --> 01:28:00,380
 they think we can't handle, because they are dead wrong and it's going to get in the way

791
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:10,140
 of the get-along of this nation we live in. So we're not living in a flat-earth society.

792
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:17,500
 We know it, and it's time that our government realizes it, as well, and that they make it

793
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:23,860
 possible for us to go forward. Because if they don't, I agree that the general public

794
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:31,020
 will. And I thank you again for making this all possible. Thank you.

795
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:40,740
 Absolutely blessed to have been given the opportunity to fill Congresswoman Huli's seat

796
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:48,940
 when she left earlier today. I'd like to echo what Congressman Cook said about the heroic

797
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:58,100
 actions of the witnesses who came here this week. And what Congressman Bartlett said about

798
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:06,620
 those brilliant stars under that winter night in West Virginia. But what I'm here to suggest

799
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:12,740
 is that we have stars who've shone just as brightly this week and other human beings

800
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:18,500
 who are here who were just as heroic. And I'd like to share a little bit about that.

801
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:27,940
 I shared my gratitude for Congressman Kilpatrick, who was the first to say, "Yeah, I'll do it."

802
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:32,900
 But there's other stories around that I'd like to share that I'd like everyone in the

803
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:39,940
 room to be aware of as well. Just before I do that, though, I'd also like to make a call-out

804
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:43,820
 to those watching this on the Internet stream, or those who might be in the room, or those

805
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:52,160
 who might see it in the weeks, months, years to come, who have the opportunity to be heroic,

806
01:29:52,160 --> 01:30:00,180
 who do know about this, who have evidence, who could testify, who live perhaps in fear.

807
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:04,060
 And my call-out to you is to do what these six members of Congress have done, which is

808
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:11,020
 to be heroic, to stand up and recognize an allegiance, if not to the Constitution, then

809
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:15,820
 to your fellow men on this planet, men and women on the planet, to share what you know

810
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:24,900
 to be true about this issue. Congressman Bartlett has been commuting two and a half hours every

811
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:34,060
 morning to be here, two and a half hours back to his farm in Virginia. He's 86 years old.

812
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:46,820
 [applause] Sir, you're a hero to me. Your commitment

813
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:51,980
 to our Constitution and the principles of liberty that it embodies, and yes, Senator

814
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:57,380
 Gravel's right, it never embodied them perfectly, but it was a huge advance in the history of

815
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:02,780
 humanity on this planet to grant liberty to the people, to see the government not as the

816
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:11,420
 giver of rights, but as of rights being self-evident and inalienable, inalienable for each individual.

817
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:19,660
 Your commitment to that is heroic. Congressman Woolsey, who's sitting next to me right now,

818
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:25,220
 authored legislation to protect whistleblowers that this government, this Congress, refused

819
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:31,300
 to pass. And we've been, if you haven't noticed, attacking whistleblowers for at least the

820
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:38,220
 last 12 years at an ever-increasing rate. It's unconstitutional. It's anti-liberty.

821
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:44,340
 It's criminal. And she and I have partnered on bringing greater freedom to other social

822
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:52,540
 organizations and inclusiveness in other battles not related to this issue. I mentioned Carolyn

823
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:58,740
 being first earlier, and I want to say how great a gift that was to all of us putting

824
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:06,180
 this together. Again, somebody had to be first. Senator Gravel, when I called him, said, "Do

825
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:09,940
 you mind if I quote you on this and share a private phone call for a bit, Senator, in

826
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:18,660
 the world of full disclosure?" He said, "How much money are you offering again? God damn

827
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:22,740
 it, I usually do these things for free, and this is the first time I can't go. My wife

828
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:27,400
 and I just made plans to be on a cruise on the Danube at that time, and he changed his

829
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:43,140
 vacation plans to be here." Canceled his vacation. Very few people in this room know, but just

830
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:47,820
 this past Sunday, Congresswoman Hooley was in the hotel, the Washington Plaza sobbing

831
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:55,780
 because she had just learned her sister had died a couple of days earlier in California,

832
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:01,300
 and she'd had the opportunity to say goodbye to her sister, but she was devastated, and

833
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:13,940
 she came here anyway. That's a hero to all of us. Then one more, and I'll conclude, but

834
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:19,060
 I think it's fair to say as a fairly hardcore libertarian, I've had a seething contempt

835
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:26,180
 for most of Congress, for most of my life. I'm currently serving as the chair of the

836
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:30,620
 National Libertarian Party's platform committee, and thinking about these issues of how do

837
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:35,700
 we save what was once the land of the free and the home of the brave, and has become

838
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:42,380
 the land of the bailed out and the home of the terrorized by the tyranny of its government.

839
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:51,340
 And I've fallen in love with Congress this week. You all have been learning about UFOs.

840
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:55,220
 I've been learning about the great character of the men and women who actually do serve

841
01:33:55,220 --> 01:34:00,660
 this nation, and if you're representatives of what's still there, even a portion of it,

842
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:07,180
 all hope is not lost. Merrill Cook invited me to come down and brief him. He lives about

843
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:12,780
 a half hour from my home in Park City, and when I got there I discovered that he's the

844
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:18,700
 full-time caretaker for the love of his life, Camille, and he has every door of his house

845
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:24,300
 locked from the inside out so that she doesn't wander off. She's suffering from Alzheimer's.

846
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:29,340
 And his one concern before he agreed to be here was, "If I come, would it be possible

847
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:34,900
 for my wife to be in the audience where I could see her so that I know she's okay, because

848
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:40,660
 I'll never put her in an institution? She's the love of my life, but I need to have her

849
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:44,460
 in a seat where I can see her with someone sitting next to her so I can focus on the

850
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:53,580
 testimony. And sir, if I could love my wife half as much as I've seen you as an example

851
01:34:53,580 --> 01:35:06,020
 of love to yours, I'll be okay." You, sir, are a hero as well.

852
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:14,420
 First of all, I would like to thank the panel. You'll be interested to know that I had considerable

853
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:25,180
 empathy with you to see all of that information being thrown at you so fast, and on a subject

854
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:35,700
 which was completely foreign to you. And you did a remarkable job of accepting it, adjusting

855
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:45,140
 it and being, in effect, transformed by it. And how I wish that more people would be in

856
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:51,460
 that position so that we could really get the word out and get the kind of action that

857
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:59,020
 we dream of. But as the Senator says, it may be just a dream, but I hope not, because time

858
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:07,340
 is running out. So thank you very much, every one of you. You are great, and we appreciate

859
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:13,660
 what you have done. And just hope, Mr. Chairman, that you too all redouble your effort when

860
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:19,540
 you go out to try and influence people to expose themselves to this kind of information

861
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:26,480
 so that they too may understand. And the witnesses, I must say, I agree with everything that's

862
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:33,380
 been said about them. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Just absolutely transfixed.

863
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:41,100
 I've seen more heroes in five days than I've seen ever before in my life, except perhaps

864
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:48,100
 on VE Day or something. But just wonderful people who are willing to stick their necks

865
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:59,280
 out because they are deeply, deeply committed in the search of truth. And that's what we've

866
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:06,100
 got to do. I hesitate to mention names because every single one of them should be singled

867
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:11,580
 up. I was particularly thankful this morning to both Richard and Linda that they got us

868
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:18,860
 into some of the things that we hadn't been in before. And I will never forget Colonel

869
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:31,740
 French admitting that his job was to invent the excuses for the UFOs and that he designated

870
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:37,820
 a lot of them as swamp gas. We all knew that the swamp gas and the plasma and the balloons

871
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:44,380
 and all this sort of stuff was you know what. But to have him say so was -- but he said

872
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:52,540
 something else that I think that is even more memorable to me. And that is never put weapons

873
01:37:52,540 --> 01:38:02,040
 in space. We adhere to the space treaty. Google the space treaty and listen to Carol Ross

874
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:12,580
 and on the reasons why we should have a common access to the space, everybody. And not try

875
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:20,300
 to see if we can outwit other people in being the first to spend a lot of money putting

876
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:27,840
 weapons in space. And I feel very strongly on that. It's an issue which I have been involved

877
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:37,980
 in for a long while and which I will continue to support. And final word is Bob Sallis I

878
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:49,180
 also remember because he summed up the situation in one classic sentence. It's power and greed.

879
01:38:49,180 --> 01:39:01,260
 It's not national security. That's what I believe.

880
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:06,060
 And Paul mentioned heroes. Let me introduce one now. Jesse, do you have a few words to

881
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:07,060
 say before we leave?

882
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:12,500
 Well, I have a few words. I'll keep these remarks short because everything has already

883
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:17,420
 been said really. But I do want to express my appreciation and honor in presenting my

884
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:21,060
 story to this panel.

885
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:29,020
 Since 1947, I have known that we're not alone in this universe. Because based on the material

886
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:33,540
 I saw that my dad brought in from the desert, I realized this is not a human manufacture.

887
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:39,460
 So if we didn't make it, it means somebody else did. And when you look out at the night

888
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:44,900
 stars, night sky there in New Mexico, you realize this beautiful place that we live

889
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:50,380
 in is called the universe, or our galaxy. As a matter of fact, there's 10 of the 22nd

890
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:56,180
 power stars in the known galaxy, which equates the number of grains of sand on the beaches

891
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:02,140
 of the earth. And to say that only one grain of sand out of that multitude has sentient

892
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:08,640
 life like us around it is just begging the question there. Because someone once said

893
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:13,420
 very truthfully that if we're the only ones here, there's an awful lot of wasted space

894
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:16,420
 out there.

895
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:23,260
 So anyway, I started thinking about this. People ask me, "How does this affect my religion,

896
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:28,700
 my belief in God?" Well, I believe in the intelligent design. Because if in the very

897
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:35,500
 beginning at the Big Bang, when things were created, if the parameters were changed just

898
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:42,540
 ever so slightly, like the rate of expansion of the universe, or the charge on the proton,

899
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:48,020
 or the electron, or the masses thereof, had that been off by 1 trillion from what it turned

900
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:53,740
 out to be, we wouldn't be here, nor would our cousins from outer space be here too.

901
01:40:53,740 --> 01:41:00,140
 And I, you know, I'll give you my philosophy. I think we're all related. People of earth,

902
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:04,580
 people of star status, you know, wherever they come from, we're all related to them.

903
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:09,460
 Because in the very beginning when the Big Bang occurred, there's something called quantum

904
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:15,900
 entanglement that occurred. And Einstein calls this spooky action at a distance, but that

905
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:21,180
 means that all particles created in the Big Bang are related to each other. One example

906
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:27,520
 is where they would take two matched particles, send one of them, could be light years away,

907
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,980
 but you'd make one change and one, the other one changes correspondingly instantly. Like

908
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:34,780
 there's faster than light communication.

909
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:40,060
 So again, we're all related, we're in this universe, and we have a lot of cousins out

910
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:41,060
 there.

911
01:41:41,060 --> 01:42:06,060
 [Applause]
