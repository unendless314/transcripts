1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
 >> I have to repeat after me, I do hereby affirm.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,640
 >> I do hereby affirm.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,760
 >> That I will tell the truth.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,760
 >> That I will tell the truth.

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,880
 >> And nothing but the truth.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,960
 >> And nothing but the truth.

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,840
 >> To the members of this committee today.

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,440
 >> To the members of this committee today.

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:13,920
 >> Thank you.

10
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,600
 >> We did it right there.

11
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,160
 >> Yeah, we did it.

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,320
 >> All right, Mr. Cameron.

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,520
 >> Okay, I had prepared a first statement, but I have a little bit of comment

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,320
 and a short second statement that I wanted to sort of add as part two.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,900
 There was some discussion here about doing an audit on the military,

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,860
 and because I've spent a lot of time on this, basically the way I see it,

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,800
 it's very simple, the military has the power, Congress doesn't.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,480
 It'd be the same as the war between the President and Congress who has power.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,040
 They have the power right now, and I think you have to take it back.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,920
 They're not going to give it to you.

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,000
 They're not going to surrender and allow you to audit them,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,520
 because they're running the show, and that's the way they want it.

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,400
 A second comment I'd like to make is regarding the same sort of issue about military,

24
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,000
 because I was involved in the Area 51 story.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,240
 I knew George Knapp, who was the chief investigative reporter.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,000
 He told the story about the Appropriations Committee in Congress had wanted,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,400
 when they heard the story about the flying saucers at Area 51 and the Aurora and all sorts

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,560
 of planes that were flying around Area 51 that the Appropriations Committee were going

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,760
 like, "What is going on here?

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,680
 We haven't heard about this.

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,100
 Did we put money up for this?"

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,960
 They sent Dick DiMatto, who was a congressional investigator, to Area 51 to get inside Area 51.

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,400
 He had all the top security clearances.

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,800
 He had everything that you needed.

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,280
 He could give people immunity, and he went in there, and he tried to talk to this one witness

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,680
 that I mentioned to you in the previous panel, this Alfred O'Donnell fellow who refused to talk,

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,840
 and he came back, and Stephen Greer can confirm this.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,160
 He talked to a number of researchers, and he told Stephen Greer,

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,080
 "I just want to let you know you're up against the varsity team

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,960
 of all black budget programs.

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,080
 Good luck."

42
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,400
 And he said with top security clearance, with Appropriations Committee behind him,

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,880
 he could not get anywhere, that this thing is so deeply held.

44
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,760
 And that's basically what Ben Rich said as well, is that it would take an act of God

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,420
 to get this thing out of Congress, because it's so deep black.

46
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,720
 Even though they have the technology, nobody's ever going to see it as far

47
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,080
 as the military is concerned.

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,400
 And I would also comment on the foreign government thing.

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,320
 I have a little bit of a disagreement with most people, because I am from Canada,

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,880
 and the idea is that the rest of the world is disclosing material.

51
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,800
 I'd say they are not disclosing material.

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,000
 They are releasing their siting files.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,040
 Siting files is what the U.S. government released with Blue Book in 1969.

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,480
 Siting reports are just garbage.

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,360
 They're just stuff that's there.

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,600
 What you want to see is you want to see the top secret material,

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 the interaction between government and military, and it still comes down,

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,520
 if you look at Britain, for example, Britain now,

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,920
 the story is they're bringing out their files.

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,700
 They're just dumping their files so they can get out of the UFO business.

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,360
 Margaret Thatcher said, when she was asked in 1997,

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,640
 you must make sure you get the facts correct and you can't tell the people.

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,440
 That's basically the rule around the world.

64
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,240
 It comes down to military technology, and I think a lot of the governments

65
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,480
 of the world are basically playing the same game that they're trying

66
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,760
 to protect the military stuff and release the core story or release the siting files.

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,080
 The little short statement, I'll try to keep it short, what I wanted

68
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,640
 to read was the fact that even though we're looking at a lot of secrecy,

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,080
 there was people inside the Clinton administration who actually did try

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,200
 to get this material out.

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
 They were trying to shake this.

72
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:51,000
 Bill Clinton, for example, had done some work with John Podesta, and he actually,

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,440
 in 2005 in Hong Kong, Bill Clinton actually was talking about this in public,

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,800
 and he stated that the vast majority of the people

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,040
 in the Clinton administration believed the story of Area 51.

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,200
 They believed there was a live alien.

77
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,440
 They believed there was a craft underground, and then Bill Clinton actually went there

78
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,880
 to try to get to the bottom of this thing, and he stated in 2005,

79
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,680
 after mentioning this, he said, "I'm probably not the first president they kept

80
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,120
 in the dark or that bureaucrats have tried to wait out."

81
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,960
 So Clinton tried to get to these materials.

82
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,160
 He told Paul Davids that he was fascinated with the subject of UFOs,

83
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,400
 and he was very interested in the latest Roswell book that had come

84
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,040
 out that was given to him at that time, and Bill Clinton had actually,

85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,440
 as we look back in the files, Bill Clinton had actually given a job to Webster Hubbell.

86
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,320
 The job he said to Webster, according to Webster Hubbell's book,

87
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,960
 Fence in High Places in 1997, Hubbell said that Bill told him,

88
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,640
 "If I put you over there in justice, I want you to find out the answer to two questions.

89
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,080
 Number one, are there UFOs, and number two, who killed JFK?"

90
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,440
 So Bill Clinton was a guy who didn't believe the official stories of the UFO

91
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,720
 or of the JFK stuff, and he actually sent someone

92
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,360
 to try to get the answers to this material.

93
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,960
 One of Bill Clinton's main, this is sort of being overlooked here,

94
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,480
 one of Bill Clinton's main allies in this effort to try to get material,

95
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,240
 it was John Podesta, and he and John Podesta actually did try to get a lot

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,280
 of classified material out into the public.

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,320
 It was the Executive Order 12958, which was signed in 1995,

98
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,040
 and it introduced a 25-year rule which hoped to bring

99
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,280
 to light many hidden secrets inside government like the UFO issue.

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,800
 What was sought was a proper balance of openness in government

101
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,640
 versus what Podesta called unthinking secrecy.

102
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,360
 Podesta stated, "Our founders knew that democracy cannot function

103
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,040
 in the absence of public information."

104
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,040
 He noted the importance of balancing the vital interests of national security

105
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,240
 with the genuine claims of public openness.

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,320
 "For two centuries, we have prospered and won in the United States

107
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,040
 because at our best, we have found a way to do both."

108
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,240
 So to achieve this, they signed the Executive Order which said that anything

109
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,480
 that was over 25 years old had to be declassified except in extreme circumstances.

110
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,520
 What basically happened was that between 1995 and 2000,

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,360
 the Clinton administration was able to declassify 800 million pages

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,680
 of documents compared to 188 million pages in the previous 15 years.

113
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,560
 Unfortunately, the sought-after UFO documents that the Clintons wanted released

114
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,200
 with this material never materialized.

115
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:52,360
 And then in 2002, Podesta who went on to work for the Obama administration stated

116
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,680
 in a public statement at a sci-fi conference, "I think it's time to open the books

117
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,960
 on the questions that have remained in the dark,

118
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,360
 on the questions of government investigations of UFOs.

119
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,440
 We ought to do it because it's right.

120
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,000
 We ought to do it because the American people can handle the truth,

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,280
 and we ought to do it because it's the law."

122
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,120
 Another ally in getting openness regarding UFOs inside the Clinton administration was the

123
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,800
 Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson who has made many pro-UFO disclosure messages

124
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,880
 over the years.

125
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,520
 For example, writing an afford to the book on the Roswell UFO crash when he was governor

126
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,160
 of New Mexico, Richardson wrote, "Clearly, it would help everybody

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,400
 if the U.S. government disclosed everything it knows.

128
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,240
 The American people can handle the truth no matter how bizarre or mundane.

129
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,640
 With full disclosure and our best scientific investigation, we should be able

130
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,280
 to find out what happened on that fateful day in 1947."

131
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,120
 Then in a question and answer while he was running for president,

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,200
 Richardson talked about his long history of attempts to get answers on UFOs.

133
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
 "I've been in government a long time.

134
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
 I've been in the cabinet.

135
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,000
 I've been in Congress, and I've always felt that the government doesn't tell the truth

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,560
 as much as it should on a lot of issues.

137
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,840
 When I was in Congress, I said to the Department of Defense, "What's the data?

138
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,560
 What is the data you have?"

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,400
 I was told the records were classified.

140
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,800
 That ticked me off.

141
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,720
 So I just want to put on the record that there are some people inside government

142
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,800
 who are actually trying to get the material out.

143
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,480
 [ Applause ]

144
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,800
 >> Ms. Howell.

145
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:49,040
 >> I was invited by Mr. Rockefeller to the Wyoming Ranch along with some

146
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,040
 of the people here, Stephen Greer was there, others.

147
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,880
 And what links in my mind was a discussion that I had with then John Mack,

148
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,000
 MD, psychiatrist from Harvard University who had taken a great interest

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,200
 in the abduction syndrome both as a psychiatrist and then as somebody who was trying

150
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,360
 to understand as I and others were.

151
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,560
 What is the true nature of an advanced intelligence that would be interacting

152
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,480
 with this planet and may not itself, the prime intelligence, be the actor here,

153
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,320
 but making various kinds of cloned entities that would interact on this particular planet

154
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,080
 in this particular atmosphere, this particular gravity and this particular solar system?

155
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,000
 And Dr. Mack and I at Mr. Rockefeller's place in Wyoming were discussing this

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,640
 and we went into the issue of why is it that the non-human intelligence as described

157
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,640
 in the human abduction syndrome appears to be 100% telepathic with the ability

158
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:07,200
 to both place impressions in human minds and to also project three dimensional holograms

159
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,400
 that the human mind and I cannot distinguish from the world around us.

160
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,360
 This is something that he, I and many others had encountered and the more deeper you get

161
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,200
 into this field the more you realize that our reality can be manipulated through our minds

162
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,840
 without us being able to tell the difference at times.

163
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,320
 And this led to a discussion which at the time I had only shared with Dr. Mack,

164
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:46,520
 God rest him wherever he is now, that very year I had a face to face with a man

165
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,720
 who was currently working in the United States military who had been aware of my work

166
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,120
 and by that '92, '93 time period I had produced the book

167
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,880
 in Alien Harvest as well as TV productions.

168
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:08,640
 And in the whole question of why would something advanced from someplace else

169
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:17,440
 in the universe be mutilating animals on this planet, this man was trying to tell me

170
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,600
 that there is a survival issue as well as a cloning issue in what we are dealing with

171
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,920
 and that genetic material has been harvested from this planet for a long time to create containers.

172
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:40,880
 And this in discussion with Dr. Mack led to, I thought I would share this today to show you

173
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,320
 if this is true what I'm going to share with you, it shows how difficult it is

174
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,240
 for all humans to relate to any aspect of all of this.

175
00:11:51,240 --> 00:12:00,800
 The military person was describing his first hand experience that occurred in 1978

176
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,080
 in a small town in Northern Arizona.

177
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,080
 He worked for a unit that would be comparable to what has been in some

178
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,760
 of the government documents called Moon Dust or Project Pounds.

179
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,040
 These are units that were put together at least as far back as right after Roswell.

180
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,880
 Units that would be trained to go to wherever there was a reported crash or landing

181
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,840
 because some of these craft have been clearly left or put down.

182
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:42,240
 And that their job would be to extract technology, the craft and the bodies.

183
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,000
 And that he was on one of those teams.

184
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,720
 And he told me that in 1978 in this town in Northern Arizona there was a flood.

185
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,880
 And that our military unit understood that the flood was not caused by nature

186
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,680
 and it was not caused by humans, it was caused by something that was

187
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,000
 in the category of what they called non-human.

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,880
 And that he was assigned to a group to go there to try to understand why had the water been

189
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,160
 released from a dam into this town by something non-human.

190
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:28,040
 And that his superior officer said we are going to communicate with

191
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,720
 and bring in one of the Eben's.

192
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,400
 And I want you to have the experience of what a telepathic download upload is.

193
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,040
 And he said they described exactly what would happen,

194
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,360
 that his superior officers would be nearby, they had done this before, it was a test.

195
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,800
 And that he was to stand in a particular position

196
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,200
 and that this non-human entity would be asked to stay on the ground

197
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,240
 because apparently they have the ability to neutralize gravity even in a focused way

198
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,560
 as an individual body that they would prefer not to walk on the ground.

199
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,920
 And that one of the conditions would be that the entity would approach him

200
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,560
 with his full knowledge and that they wanted him to have the experience

201
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,880
 of the telepathic communication.

202
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:31,840
 And I was telling Dr. Mack at Mr. Rockefeller's facility in Wyoming

203
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:39,480
 that he told me very honestly, he said you know I was so full of myself as a young man

204
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,960
 that when they were trying to warn me that I would not be prepared for what happened,

205
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,600
 I thought nonsense.

206
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,120
 But he said it's my superior officer and he said I want you to know that there will be a point

207
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,480
 where you are going to want to run or collapse and I'm ordering you to stand.

208
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,160
 And he said I thought it was so silly and then everything started to unfold

209
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,400
 and the being came about four feet high, he was six foot four,

210
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,120
 he remembered how much taller he was.

211
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,000
 They had told him the being would come up to about three to four feet from him

212
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,080
 but be very low and they told him all controlled,

213
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,320
 that the being would simply raise its head and when the eyes connected with his eyes,

214
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,040
 he would no longer be in control of his mind.

215
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,000
 He thought all of it was nonsense and then the being's head started to rise

216
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:51,200
 and he said Linda imagine having seven feature films with sound, with touch, with heat,

217
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,720
 with every sensation that we know and more and over all of the seven films running

218
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,560
 in your mind are gold three-dimensional symbols.

219
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,320
 And he said I remember that my knees began to shake and buckled and I knew

220
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:15,480
 that I was fainting and men caught him and he said they put me on a cot

221
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,760
 and they left me there for three hours and when I woke up,

222
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,600
 if God himself had asked me what had been communicated in those seven films,

223
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,560
 I would not know.

224
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,160
 He said my superior officer told me later every human thinking

225
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,080
 about extraterrestrial biological entities and the whole issue of us not being alone

226
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,200
 in the universe and the wonder of being able to travel the universe

227
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:53,160
 and to communicate with non-humans, we would like to do it over coffee

228
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,040
 and he said it isn't going to happen because what happens

229
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,920
 when their minds telepathically download to our minds,

230
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:11,920
 they are uploading every single thing we've ever experienced or thought from our minds

231
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,440
 and that the end result often is information is added by the non-humans

232
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:26,680
 into the human mind that has had this experience but then we live on a planet

233
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,640
 where our fellow humans cannot even hear what uploaded downloaded information

234
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,320
 from non-humans might be because we have taken the position as odd as it is

235
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,200
 that we are alone in the universe and this does not exist and Dr. Mack,

236
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:53,400
 after I told him that story, he looked at me and he said, you know Linda,

237
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,000
 I agree I think we are dealing with extraterrestrial biological entities

238
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,800
 in some cases but he said, you know, I think that it's too complex

239
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:12,760
 that it must involve time travelers, other dimensions and that we are truly

240
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:19,200
 like little infants approaching something that is beyond our understanding

241
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,960
 and I will just close exactly on that note with another man who died not long

242
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,840
 after I was able to talk with him somewhere like around 1992.

243
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,760
 He also served in the military high ranking.

244
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,960
 Some people had sought me out because he wanted to ask me a question

245
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,920
 about some of my work and I will never forget he said,

246
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,600
 Linda this is all so strange and it has been so strange to all of us

247
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,640
 that have been exposed to it for so long that not any of us ever want to take it home

248
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,720
 to our spouses, our children or anyone we know,

249
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:14,240
 not because it's threatening necessarily but because nobody knows how

250
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:22,240
 to have the discussion and today we are meeting at the National Press Club

251
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,680
 in Washington where there have been various revolutions before and it seems

252
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:37,040
 to me no matter how strange it is, if we don't get past this point

253
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:46,040
 of having our government built on 60 years of lies to protect us,

254
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,280
 the nation probably will implode and I think you know what I mean.

255
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,040
 >> Thank you.

256
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,840
 [ Applause ]

257
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,640
 >> Dr. Greer.

258
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,760
 >> Well on that note, it reminds me of a conversation I had with some people

259
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,400
 at the CIA and there's a term that's used there and you'll forgive my vernacular

260
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,000
 where much of this subject is referred to as WSFM, sounds like a radio station,

261
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,760
 it means weird science and fricking magic and that is the term that's used at the CIA

262
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,320
 and other places to describe some of this and I think that what we have to understand is

263
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,240
 that if you're dealing with and I do want to go into this because this is part

264
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,640
 of the summary and brief I provided for in the Obama briefing and elsewhere,

265
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,160
 if you're dealing with civilizations that are 10 to the 6th to 10 to the 7th years,

266
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,320
 hundreds of thousands to millions of years, technologically more developed

267
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,280
 than we are, every manifestation of their technology would look like magic to us.

268
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:05,720
 For example, if you were to go back to the time of Thomas Jefferson and show them an iPhone

269
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,120
 or worse to say in Massachusetts, you'd be burned at the stake as a witch

270
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,320
 because everything would be absolutely look like magic.

271
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,360
 So I think that we have to have a certain amount of humility in realizing

272
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,920
 that we're dealing with a universe that is vast and infinite, that in our own galaxy alone,

273
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:30,000
 which has 100 billion star systems, the same number of stars as we have neurons

274
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,040
 in our brain interestingly, that we're dealing with civilizations just in our own galaxy

275
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,320
 which is one of billions that are able to go through interstellar space.

276
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,640
 Now I want to touch on this for a moment because it deals with a little bit

277
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,440
 that Linda referred to in terms of trans-dimensional or other dimensions

278
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,600
 and the technologies and the sciences dealing with this subject are what we have termed

279
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:04,560
 trans-dimensional interstellar, TDIs and this refers to very advanced sciences

280
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:11,960
 and technologies where there is a nexus between electromagnetism in the magnetic field,

281
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,520
 gravitational forces in three-dimensional space and time and what Dr. John at Princeton

282
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,360
 in the engineering lab began to prove is the science of consciousness

283
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,480
 which was actually an issue that I did talk a fair amount with Lawrence Rockefeller about.

284
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,720
 Now a lot of people say well this gets into the deep end of the pool very quickly

285
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,000
 and in fact it does but I think that it's important to understand that if you're dealing

286
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,520
 with civilizations that have gotten here and that's what we're dealing with,

287
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,840
 you're not dealing with something that can go just straight through space at the speed

288
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,720
 of light even because the speed of light is too slow.

289
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,280
 And I remember when I was having dinner with CIA Director Wolsey and his wife

290
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,800
 and actually the really most insightful question came from Dr. Wolsey

291
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,040
 who at the time was Chief Operating Officer of the National Academy of Sciences

292
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:07,000
 and she said what I want to know is how are these civilizations communicating

293
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,120
 across the vastness of space because your cell phone

294
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,160
 and radio waves are going at the speed of light and I said yes that's just too slow,

295
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,280
 speed of light is way too slow.

296
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:26,040
 And I had to, I had a gut check, I said do I tell her the truth and lose all credibility

297
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:32,440
 as a scientist and a doctor or do I tell her something that sounds scientific

298
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,080
 but that's really not true and ever since then I have vowed

299
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,520
 that if someone is intelligent enough to ask the question I will provide the answers truthfully

300
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,320
 as I can so I turned to her and I said well Dr. Wolsey it's like this,

301
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:56,080
 it turns out thinking is the best way to travel and the speed of thought is not quantifiable.

302
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,800
 However, when you start getting into the new physics that have been done

303
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,880
 where you have the ability to teleport across vast distances instantly

304
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,600
 and this has been done with particles but we're talking about civilizations that can do it

305
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,560
 with entire spacecraft and occupants, you're dealing with an entirely new physics

306
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:23,000
 but their communication devices and their own innate abilities allow for thought actuated events

307
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,360
 and I know Dr. Wood may mention this and that he discovered when he was doing some work

308
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,600
 for Old Mac McDonald and McDonald Douglas that he looked into some cases where in some meetings

309
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,440
 with these ETs involved a little box and there was a direct thought communication

310
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,280
 but it was also being facilitated through electronics and this is something

311
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:49,680
 that we call technology assisted consciousness and thought and this is a very specific area

312
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,920
 of study that I really devoted about 22 years to which may be beyond the scope of this hearing

313
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,440
 but I think that in terms of just bringing this issue around there are so many aspects of it

314
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,080
 that are very exciting from the point of view of science, technology

315
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:12,160
 and understanding the universe and ourselves and also who are we and where did we come from

316
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:19,880
 and how is it that we exist in this cosmos and I agree with Edgar Mitchell on this

317
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,720
 that is a conscious quantum hologram that is awake and that we are all part of

318
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,520
 and that mind itself is the ultimate final frontier not space but consciousness in mind.

319
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,120
 Now I know that Lawrence Rockefeller was very interested in these things

320
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:44,240
 because I had conversations with him also but one of the things that I found when I was working

321
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,720
 with these folks is that there's a saying in American business everyone wants to be first

322
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:57,800
 to be second and so in this case there's so many people who have had an interest of this

323
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,880
 but they want to hold back and not speak the whole truth about it but I think we need

324
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,280
 to be able to liberate ourselves to speak the truth and it involves many,

325
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,440
 many complex issues part of which has been touched on in the last 15 or 20 minutes.

326
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,400
 One thing I also want to point out is that if we're being visited by advanced civilizations

327
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:26,000
 and it's our assessment that certainly we are, who is handling that relationship?

328
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,360
 Do we cede that management to the military industrial complex

329
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,800
 and what are the consequences of doing so?

330
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,360
 Think about this very carefully.

331
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,520
 I remember doing a meeting with the Boutrous Golly family, the UN Secretary General,

332
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,800
 his wife Leah Golly and we were talking about this and Leah Golly turned to me

333
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,000
 and she said, "Dr. Grier, we need you to do this now."

334
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I said, "I'm a country doctor in North Carolina rattling around in an emergency department.

335
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,160
 You're the head of the world."

336
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,480
 She says, "No, we can't.

337
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,160
 It's too dangerous for Boutrous."

338
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:05,120
 I'm quoting and then I remember talking to this wonderful Senator Claiborne Pell

339
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,320
 who was mentioned earlier and I was speaking with him and I would never have gone to college

340
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,960
 if not for a Pell Grant because I was very, very, very poor.

341
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,760
 I grew up in North Carolina, I had no resources, put myself through the last years of high school

342
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,040
 and college and med school, but I mean really poor.

343
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,080
 And what I-- most people don't know that, but what I found when I was talking to Senator Pell

344
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,800
 who was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and I was at a meeting with Edgar Mitchell

345
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,760
 and some other folks and I looked at him and he said, "Dr. Grier,

346
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,080
 I have never been given any information on this even though I have inquired

347
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,800
 through any official channels."

348
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,600
 And I said, "Yes, sir.

349
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,920
 What a shame because you, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,

350
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,920
 have been denied the responsibility of dealing with the ultimate foreign relations issue."

351
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,920
 And I pointed to the stars above our heads and he looked at me through those hornwim grasses

352
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,280
 and said, "Well, you know, Dr. Grier, you may be right."

353
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,720
 I said, "Well, I am."

354
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,080
 And I said, "Well, what a shame."

355
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,960
 So I think this is another dimension.

356
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,200
 There's a science and technology part of it, but there's the part of it about relationships

357
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,360
 and we are not alone in the universe and we need to have a situation on this planet

358
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:31,280
 where our higher nature, our better angels, folks like Senator Pell and others

359
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,400
 who would approach this in an enlightened way could reach out

360
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,160
 and form what has begun to be discussed in the French government that I referred

361
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,720
 to earlier in this Ministry of Defense memo to me, a peaceful, interplanetary,

362
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,440
 interstellar diplomatic initiative.

363
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,560
 And to be honest with you, that's how I first got involved with this,

364
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,520
 was to establish such an effort, which we are doing as a citizen's diplomatic effort.

365
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,640
 But in the meanwhile, I got diverted into this morass of the national security state

366
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,160
 because I felt that our leaders need to know and more importantly, the public need to know.

367
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,520
 And we need to then figure out how we're going to advance.

368
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,360
 And in the summary I did for the president, there are a number of action points.

369
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:25,240
 And one of them is to appoint internationally a high level committee of folks who could go out

370
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:31,800
 and make a peaceful contact that is not militarized, that is not covert,

371
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,160
 that is not being run by the national security state, but is being done on behalf of all

372
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,720
 of us, the children of earth.

373
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:50,880
 [ Applause ]

374
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,360
 >> Okay. Mr. Bartlett.

375
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,160
 >> Thank you very much.

376
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,520
 Appreciate your testimony very much.

377
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,440
 We have a free press, so-called free press.

378
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,240
 >> Theoretically, yes.

379
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,200
 There are advantages and disadvantages of a free press.

380
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,680
 They reported the Boston bombing.

381
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,520
 There will very likely be copycat things because that was reported.

382
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,360
 Where the press is controlled that would not be reported, so there would be no copycat.

383
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,840
 So there are some disadvantages to a free press.

384
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,280
 Where is the press in all of this?

385
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,920
 If in fact there is a story to be told here, why isn't the press telling that story?

386
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,880
 If there is a cover-up, do they not seem to be complicit in that cover-up?

387
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,760
 >> Yes. Well, can I comment on that?

388
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,040
 >> By control from above.

389
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,680
 >> I think this is a really central issue.

390
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:54,680
 And I actually, over my 22 years of being deeply involved with this at various levels,

391
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,320
 I have concluded that the secrecy is very much involving the fact

392
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,960
 that on certain issues we do not have a free press anymore than we have a free market economy.

393
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,320
 And I think that this is a serious problem.

394
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,560
 And I have a document that will be in the materials that I'm providing for the committee

395
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:20,960
 that is a 1991 CIA document where it talks about the fact that they have folks

396
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:28,320
 at all the major media outlets, wire services, news magazines, television networks to change,

397
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,040
 alter, or delay and stop stories that they would like to see stopped.

398
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,440
 Now this was released briefly and then reclassified.

399
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,560
 It was under the first President Bush term.

400
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,120
 And this is not a contested CIA document.

401
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,880
 What that means is that on certain issues this will be absolutely, there will be an intervention.

402
00:31:51,880 --> 00:32:00,840
 And we saw this happen with the 2001 event at this national press club disclosure launch 12 years ago,

403
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,680
 almost today, on May 9th of 2001.

404
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,360
 And one of the people I dealt with, Bob Schwartz, who was on the board of Time Life

405
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,360
 that later became AOL, Time Warner, and CNN, the whole conglomerate,

406
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,800
 he told me that he was very good friends with Mike Wallace.

407
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,160
 And he had given him a lot of these documents that we had.

408
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,640
 And Mike Wallace wanted to do the story at 60 Minutes.

409
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,280
 And the corporate CBS, and I think at the time it was controlled by Westinghouse,

410
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,880
 a big defense contractor, did not permit him to do the story.

411
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,040
 Ira Rosen, who was at ABC News executive producer for 2020 and Primetime Live,

412
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,440
 he came to my home in Virginia out near Thomas Jefferson's home, ironically.

413
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,280
 And I gave him 35 digital hours of top secret witness testimony and many documents.

414
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,840
 And he said, "This, if true, is the biggest story ever.

415
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,760
 I want to do this story."

416
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,720
 I said, "Well, I'll cooperate fully."

417
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,280
 He had gotten his Emmy working with Mike Wallace at 60 Minutes where he has returned.

418
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,080
 And I said, "I don't think you'll be allowed to do this story."

419
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,000
 And Ira Rosen said, "Oh, yes.

420
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,560
 I'm the executive producer of these shows.

421
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,760
 I can do it."

422
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,000
 And I said, "Okay." Well, two weeks later, he called me up.

423
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,680
 And he said, "Dr. Greer, they won't let me do this story."

424
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,000
 I said, "Ira, who are they?"

425
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,720
 And he said, "Dr. Greer, you know who they are."

426
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,320
 Now, I could tell you probably 100 stories like that.

427
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,720
 And this becomes very worrisome.

428
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,760
 Here we are in the National Press Club.

429
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,840
 And we have a lot of enormously important information.

430
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,440
 And, you know, in the New York Times, if you have three confirmed sources

431
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,000
 for a controversial story, they can run with it.

432
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,440
 Here, the Disclosure Project, which I founded some years ago,

433
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,000
 it was first Project Starlight when I began to work with Lawrence Rockefeller.

434
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,880
 We now have over 500.

435
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,760
 Many of them, I have the names of them and they can be subpoenaed.

436
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,560
 Some of them, about 100 of them, we have on digital videotape.

437
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,840
 Why isn't this a story?

438
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,160
 And I think that this becomes a very important question in a democracy.

439
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,240
 You know, if you have the larger media not covering something

440
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,840
 that 50, 60 percent of the public believe is true,

441
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,080
 and there's an enormous amount of data, 4,000 landing cases.

442
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,680
 The Comita Report, where they documented the landing in Provence of a craft,

443
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,280
 the Bentwaters case, where a craft landed at RAF Bentwaters

444
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,840
 and left physical trace that has been confirmed by the Ministry of Defense.

445
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,080
 We have all this hard data and information.

446
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,280
 We have radar traces of these objects moving.

447
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,560
 We have pilot cases.

448
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,360
 We have over 3,500 pilot reports in our archives.

449
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,880
 This isn't a story.

450
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,160
 How can that be?

451
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,200
 Now, there's another reason, the ha-ha factor.

452
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,320
 I have met with so many senior people in government who say,

453
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,360
 "I am so interested in this, but don't let anyone know that I'm interested."

454
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,400
 And the reason for it, I think, you know, you could be gay and have five wives

455
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,280
 and do whatever, I mean, you could do anything and be out of the closet on it,

456
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,720
 and it would be no problem, but this subject, whoa, watch out,

457
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,000
 because your career is on the line, as mine was.

458
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,440
 Okay. Now, I think that what you find is that the social opprobrium,

459
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,320
 the appropriate term, attached to this issue was launched in 1953.

460
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,960
 We have a CIA document that describes their attempts to debunk

461
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,320
 and ridicule the subject, but also, very important, to engage Disney studios

462
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,520
 to make cartoons and movies about it that would marginalize the subject.

463
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,440
 This is a CIA document, little green men, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

464
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,400
 So that has worked, and there's an Air Force major, George Filer, who I know,

465
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,560
 he may be here, who said, "Look, the secrecy really has been created mainly

466
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,880
 through the force of just ridicule.

467
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,720
 People don't want to be made a laughing stock."

468
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,720
 And I think that fear of ridicule by one's peerage, whether you're a senator

469
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,720
 or a doctor or a university professor, is a very hard thing

470
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,920
 to overcome once the counterintelligence people have done their business,

471
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,200
 and they have on this, and it is propaganda.

472
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,040
 There is very serious information in intelligence, and I think that we have

473
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,160
 to figure out how do we get around the truth embargo, as Steve calls it.

474
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,000
 In reality, we're sort of in, it's not just the government doing the embargo,

475
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,160
 it's we are doing the embargo because we have been brainwashed to laugh

476
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,360
 at this issue instead of look at it in a very serious, scientific,

477
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,240
 in-depth, and honest and truthful way.

478
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:47,360
 [ Applause ]

479
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,920
 >> So time keep, how much more time does Mr. Bartlett have?

480
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,120
 >> Three minutes.

481
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,040
 >> Thank you very much.

482
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,200
 I would think that the main reason the press is not covering is a ridicule thing.

483
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,840
 We've been watching the tweets and what's going on today.

484
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,480
 They're not all positive.

485
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,760
 They're not as negative as we thought they might be,

486
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,000
 but they're not all positive tweets.

487
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,400
 >> Can I make a comment on this?

488
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,320
 >> I wanted to turn for just a moment, go ahead.

489
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,880
 >> Yeah, I just want to comment on this because I've had some involvement with this.

490
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,600
 As I mentioned in my statement, Bill Clinton asked Webster Hubbell to go

491
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,800
 and get the answer to who killed JFK, and if you go to the files that have been recovered,

492
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,240
 there's like 5,000, almost 6,000 pages of Kennedy assassination stuff

493
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,720
 that the Clintons did uncover, and he asked them to uncover JFK and UFOs.

494
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,680
 When that book was released, "Friends in High Places" by Hubbell in 1997, that, of course,

495
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:51,640
 the very next day in the White House press briefing, his question was brought up,

496
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,200
 and it was Deborah Oren, who was no friend of the Clintons from "New York Post"

497
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,040
 who asked the question.

498
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,480
 She asked the president's press secretary,

499
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,600
 "Can you tell me did Webster Hubbell get the job to go out and look at UFOs?"

500
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,200
 And he walked around the question the first time, and Deborah Oren

501
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,120
 in an interview said she came back with a follow-up question, and she said,

502
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,760
 "I'd like to know is what Mr. Hubbell writes in his book true?"

503
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,800
 And the press secretary for the president said, "I'm not going

504
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,040
 to comment what people write in their personal books."

505
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,160
 And Deborah Oren said in an interview later, she said, "I sat there and waited

506
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,840
 for someone to follow up on this very important question,

507
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,480
 and the rest of the White House press corps rolled over and played dead."

508
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,880
 And basically what it comes down to is if you worked your way up to the White House,

509
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,400
 you don't want to be the one that asked the stupid UFO question.

510
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,160
 You want to ask something very smart because you may end up losing your job.

511
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,440
 You worked your way up there.

512
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,600
 So a lot of it does have to do with the ridicule, and a lot of it has to do

513
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,040
 with I mentioned Chase Brandon who was this 42-year CIA guy.

514
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,200
 He writes a fictional book about Roswell, and there was one of the stories

515
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,000
 that we'd always tried to track in the UFO world, and that was by Richard Helms.

516
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,840
 It was a statement where Richard Helms says, "We control all the media

517
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,480
 of any consequence in America."

518
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,600
 And we were trying to track this, and if you look in Chase Brandon's book,

519
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,560
 his character in the book actually uses this statement.

520
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,120
 Jesse Helms said, "We control all media of any consequence in America,"

521
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,760
 and the character says, "I wish he hadn't said that."

522
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,520
 >> Thank you.

523
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,560
 I go back.

524
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,320
 >> Thank you.

525
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,520
 Senator Gravel.

526
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,000
 >> Can you come to any other conclusion as a body

527
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,680
 that our nation is essentially ruled by a military junta?

528
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,640
 Can you come to any other conclusion based upon all the statements that have been made?

529
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,560
 >> Well, I think, yeah, I think it's not just military.

530
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,080
 I think it's a large macroeconomic and financial system.

531
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,360
 So it's the military, industrial, corporate, financial complex,

532
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,960
 and I'm not against corporations.

533
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,920
 However, as Jefferson said, the unchecked power of a corporation.

534
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,040
 And see, if our budget is $3.8 trillion, but we're talking about something

535
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,920
 that if it's disclosed would threaten the privately owned interest in the oil, gas,

536
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,720
 coal, utility industries that are estimated in the multi-hundred trillions of dollars,

537
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,480
 what tail is wagging the dog of our democracy?

538
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,160
 And that's the big question.

539
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,920
 >> Let me add to that.

540
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,720
 I came across a study two years ago in Switzerland, Zurich,

541
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:40,320
 where an institute studied the interlocking directorates, 43,000 corporations.

542
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,720
 They winnowed it down to 1,350 corporations.

543
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,280
 And these are interlocking directorates, interlocking family ties.

544
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,160
 And primarily the top 10 were banks, international banks.

545
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,960
 And they own 60% of the wealth of the world.

546
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,080
 >> Correct.

547
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,320
 >> You're aware of that?

548
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,360
 >> Yes, I'm very aware of that study, yes.

549
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,640
 >> Congresswoman Kilpatrick.

550
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,280
 >> Thank you.

551
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,200
 This has been an absolutely awesome day.

552
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:21,680
 The professional testimony that we've heard, awesome.

553
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,720
 Everything that you've said here, this congressperson knows it to be true from things

554
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
 that we've done in our own lives.

555
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,720
 President and the military is always a friction there.

556
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,160
 Governors and their state and military or police troops, it's a little friction.

557
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,120
 Mayors and their police force, it's a little something there.

558
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,920
 Who has the power?

559
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,120
 I think that's an inherent something that our world witnesses,

560
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,040
 and I certainly have over my 60 plus years of life.

561
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,880
 I think it's important that we work with the foreign governments.

562
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:59,400
 There's been 10 or 15 already identified who have acknowledged this existence.

563
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,760
 I want to be a part of that.

564
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,120
 I want to go, I want to see, I want to -- all of that.

565
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,720
 And I'm presenting myself for that because I want to do that.

566
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,400
 [ Applause ]

567
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,840
 The public-private partnerships that I mentioned earlier today got to do it.

568
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,960
 Once upon a time, this country had horse and buggies.

569
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,600
 We moved to cars, and now it's moving to something else.

570
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,200
 There were no emails and computers and all of that two decades ago.

571
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,040
 I mean, evolving.

572
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,440
 When you talk about oil, gas, and coal, yeah, that's the money, and it's about money and power.

573
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,200
 But who's to say you can't transition that to what we're talking about here today

574
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,680
 with the kind of partnerships that we have to build in order to do that?

575
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,440
 So we phase out of oil, gas, and coal, and we're doing it already, but we're just not.

576
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,560
 I don't think this issue is now that I've sat here all day is separate from it.

577
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,360
 I'm sure I'll know more about this by the Friday.

578
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,000
 But I think we have to look at it in terms

579
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,240
 of a comprehensive something that's related rather than separate from.

580
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,160
 The things that you all have testified today, and I know them to be true.

581
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,320
 I don't even know people who have had this.

582
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,760
 And in the last month since they found out I'm on it,

583
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,640
 I get all kind of things from around the world.

584
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,760
 I'm happy you're going to be listening, and I'm happy that I am listening.

585
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,280
 But I want us to consider who that public private doctor for exactly Dr. Greer.

586
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,200
 Excellent information, all of that.

587
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,040
 Got to be funded.

588
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,640
 I do money.

589
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,000
 That's what I've done in my career.

590
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,080
 I don't have any, but I mean, that's where I work.

591
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,600
 That's where I work.

592
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,840
 But we can do this.

593
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,560
 I mean, we can do that with--

594
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,760
 if we broaden our scope, it's not us and they, or them and us.

595
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,680
 It's us, or there's nothing.

596
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,360
 I think it's that important, and I don't have the answer for it now.

597
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,160
 I just know that there's something here that we've touched on,

598
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,520
 at least in my little experience in these eight hours.

599
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,760
 It's something to build on, and I want us to consider that.

600
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,600
 The military industrial financial complex is real.

601
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,320
 It's real.

602
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,200
 I mean, and everyone knows it.

603
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,400
 It's a real entity, and it really directs our world in the various countries.

604
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,320
 I can't speak for them.

605
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,640
 I can speak for US.

606
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,960
 And it's real.

607
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,120
 Not to be thrown stones at, but to work with.

608
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,120
 And I think when we bring them in as partners,

609
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,680
 because actually the complex has more power than the president.

610
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,200
 I'm sorry.

611
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,800
 I hate to just put that on record.

612
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,480
 The president-- not the person, but the office is what I speak.

613
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,720
 That when we deal with it as, again, as a whole thing,

614
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,160
 and not us over here and them over there, we can do this, Stephen.

615
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,040
 It's just going to take, I think, an international coalition that

616
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,000
 would help-- someone just said it-- help bring us to where we want to go

617
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,120
 to do some of the things that we need to do.

618
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,600
 And then, finally for me, the Military Intelligence Committee,

619
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,960
 we have to have that.

620
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,040
 And it exists.

621
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,920
 And we've always thought that it helps us do a lot of things,

622
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,440
 like Boston most recently, and as big as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan,

623
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,640
 and all have been all over the world in this job of mine,

624
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,960
 but I haven't in this capacity.

625
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,480
 I'm offering myself for that.

626
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,880
 I see that we can get to this.

627
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,840
 This was a brilliant way to start it, Stephen,

628
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,840
 and build on what you guys have already done

629
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,960
 for these last 50-plus years.

630
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,200
 This is the 21st century.

631
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,000
 The 20th century is over.

632
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,040
 It's about coalitions and partnerships.

633
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,040
 And it's an international one that will save our world and our country.

634
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,640
 So to all of you there, I always say the woman,

635
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,440
 she brings a whole other perspective here.

636
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,120
 Thank you, without notes and all of that.

637
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,200
 If you harm God's animals, and something does from time to time,

638
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,160
 as you just described, in a way that we know nothing of,

639
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,880
 or there's no blood or other liquids, fluids,

640
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,120
 that's something that I believe, too, and I'm going to end on this.

641
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:41,840
 I don't have a question.

642
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,560
 I'm making my final statement of the day.

643
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:50,040
 If you talk about everything we've talked about today,

644
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
 and this is just day one.

645
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,520
 I can't even imagine what we're going to do the rest of the week.

646
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:59,400
 But the hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, winds,

647
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,440
 I'm a biblical person.

648
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,160
 I believe it's biblical.

649
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,320
 I believe that everything that's going on, what we're talking about now,

650
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,800
 and the power that might be out there, that we, they,

651
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,280
 are scared it's going to overtake us.

652
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,840
 It won't overtake us, because we're going to work with it.

653
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,840
 We're going to build a partnership.

654
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,200
 And the sooner that we get it done, the safer our children will be,

655
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,560
 the more protected our seniors will be who built these great countries,

656
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,800
 and the international connection is what we must do.

657
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,480
 So for all of you today who've come before us and become, for me specifically,

658
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,000
 I just want to say thank you.

659
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,600
 It's not the end, it's just the beginning.

660
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,600
 Thank you very much.

661
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,920
 [ Applause ]

662
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,800
 Congressman Cook.

663
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,200
 >> I do want to say that I've been most interested

664
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,400
 in your references to Bill Richardson.

665
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,280
 Now, I may not be a member of their party.

666
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,800
 I may be a member of a party that's opposed them on many, many things,

667
00:46:53,800 --> 00:47:01,960
 but I have never known a more intelligent, and honest,

668
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:11,200
 and deeply committed members of the government, members of the administrations,

669
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,040
 and in many, in Congress and everything else, as they, and in cabinet positions

670
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:21,760
 that I think they held, plus were almost going to be holding.

671
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,960
 So I, and I've been deeply impressed as I've known, even before today,

672
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:35,440
 before what you said, Stephen, that these people have been particularly prominent

673
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,360
 in wanting to end what you called the truth embargo.

674
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:47,160
 Certainly, Richardson has made statements that he says, hey, definitely,

675
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,760
 just to have somebody of his stature say that something landed in Roswell,

676
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,200
 and we need to have those files.

677
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,520
 The reason I'm putting that back under this question is because I can already tell,

678
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,720
 especially from our luncheon discussion as former members of the Congress,

679
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,760
 that there seems to be developing a consensus that whatever we think

680
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,440
 of the evidence at this point, we think there needs to be hearings,

681
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,480
 and there needs to be official hearings.

682
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,160
 Again, I'm, I'm impressed that the attorney, I forget his name right now.

683
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,840
 >> Daniel Sheen.

684
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:33,160
 >> Yes. But although he called for UA hearings initially, he kind of just was talking

685
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,200
 as his last statement that we need congressional hearings.

686
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:44,680
 Now, I don't know whether this group, this panel should be focusing on members

687
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,400
 of the Congress to do something or members of the administration to do something,

688
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:55,520
 and I also, or maybe both, I shouldn't use the expression rats chasing rats,

689
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,400
 but maybe that's not such a bad example.

690
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,000
 >> Well, it's a little bit, but you know, here's the nice thing about the new media.

691
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,280
 We have a world now where we can stream.

692
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,080
 The Huffington Post, okay, the Huffington Post did an article about the film Sirius

693
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,800
 that's just been released that's based on our work.

694
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,600
 It had like 4 million people look at it.

695
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,760
 I think that we can do a lot that we couldn't have done 12 years ago, 5 years ago

696
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,440
 with the new media and the people's media.

697
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,000
 That's one thing.

698
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,400
 The other is that I would, I want to put out a call for other witnesses

699
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,000
 from inside the military, intelligence, and corporate world to come forward,

700
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,680
 but who will come forward, rank, serial number, name, actionable intelligence.

701
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,640
 One thing I want to comment on, there is a confusion that's been

702
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:50,320
 in the room a little bit today between access and control.

703
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,880
 Now, I just want to say that I have been able to provide actionable intelligence

704
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,640
 to where there would be access, but you don't necessarily have control,

705
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,640
 and I think we have to understand the difference for the president and for even some

706
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,680
 of these senior military officials that I've met with and continue to meet with.

707
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:13,800
 There is a huge problem there, and this is something that does need to be fixed.

708
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,680
 The media is one part, the public is one part.

709
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,200
 I think we have to get all these components going, but something that needs to be looked

710
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,560
 at from a constitutional and national security point of view is

711
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,400
 that you cannot have information like this being withheld from the commander in chief

712
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,520
 and senior people like the Defense Intelligence Agency head or the CIA director,

713
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,720
 which we know is going on.

714
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:41,200
 And I think that if we cannot fix that, our democracy is in danger, but so is our world.

715
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,720
 Thank you.

716
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,160
 [ Applause ]

717
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,880
 >> Okay, our cleanup batter is Congresswoman Houli.

718
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,440
 >> Well, I'm going to follow up on the question, what you just said, Mr. Greer,

719
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,320
 and that is you talk about access, talk about control.

720
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:12,800
 How do we, all of us, change that around so that the president feels in control or the person

721
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,560
 that heads up an agency feels in control?

722
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,720
 Give me some of your suggestions.

723
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,160
 >> Well, you know, one of the most poignant things that happened some years ago

724
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,560
 when I was wrapping up my almost three-hour meeting with the CIA director was

725
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,960
 that I gave him something very much like this that has a bunch of recommendations

726
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,600
 for executive action, executive orders, and he looked at me squarely in the eyes,

727
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:46,360
 and he said, "Dr. Greer, how do we disclose that which we don't have control over?"

728
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,240
 And I said, "You get control over it."

729
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,960
 Now, you have to, I hate to use the term, lean into it and lean into it hard.

730
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,080
 I mean, the powers of the Congress and the powers of the presidency

731
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:04,000
 and the courts are substantial, and I think that if they are then denied access control

732
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,680
 over projects that we can prove are going on, that there should be serious consequences

733
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,960
 to that because that is treason.

734
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:17,440
 And I think that the other point is that the public have to demand this level of transparency,

735
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:29,120
 which, and then ultimately, there needs to be a level of compassion for those who are trapped

736
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:35,760
 in a system that they are terrified to take on, and I think that this is why there has

737
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,640
 to also be a level of protection for people who want to step forward, who are deep insiders.

738
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,400
 I mean, I would love to give a list of names of folks that I have met with in very high

739
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,040
 and deep positions, but they've asked me not to.

740
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,800
 I recently put on YouTube the testimony of a man who had worked with the CIA

741
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,360
 who would not let me release it until he died, and it's up there now, palette, go look at it.

742
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,160
 I think that it deals with something you'll hear about later, implants,

743
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,440
 which were actually developed by the CIA in the '70s and '80s.

744
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,360
 My point is that we have to also understand that many of these men and women

745
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,400
 who come forward are enormously courageous, but there are many others who would like to,

746
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,880
 but they can't just do it in some kind of a circus.

747
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,080
 They also have to be assured of their protection and their safety.

748
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:28,600
 >> And I can address the whole intimidation issue from something that happened.

749
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:33,120
 People are so afraid for their lives, their families, because they have had

750
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:41,600
 to sign non-disclosure agreements in which they basically are told if you say anything

751
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:47,760
 to anyone, your family will suffer because you will not only be put in prison,

752
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,560
 but all benefits will be denied your family.

753
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,640
 I've talked with several people who have signed such disclosure agreements that are working

754
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,280
 on some capacity in the extraterrestrial issue.

755
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:08,520
 And this really came home to me, probably this was back around 1985, '86.

756
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:17,040
 A security guard at Lockheed Martin in the facility in Denver had approached me

757
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,800
 because she had read my book, my first book, An Alien Harvest.

758
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,160
 And she had asked for an autograph at some place where I was speaking.

759
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,440
 And she volunteered, she said if you need any help with anything, I'll help you.

760
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,320
 And she began to do some filing and various things.

761
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:39,560
 And she was very, I guess you would say she was,

762
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,520
 she felt that An Alien Harvest was a book that should be out there in the world.

763
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:50,380
 And one day she told me, she had a friend working inside of Lockheed Martin in a position

764
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:55,280
 that was related to something that they were doing in aerospace, but it was classified.

765
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,880
 It was one of those office complexes where you had to have the need to know in order

766
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,000
 to enter or the red and the blue lights would spin.

767
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,400
 And she invited him as a friend to go out to dinner or something.

768
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,160
 And he said, why don't you come over for, we're having a birthday party next weekend.

769
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,120
 So this is somebody who has a confidential position and now she's going to the house.

770
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:25,600
 And she said, I just thought your book would be the most perfect gift.

771
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:34,720
 And she said, I presented your book and he took it and he looked at it and he spun

772
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,760
 through the pages as if he already knew and he dropped it on the floor and said,

773
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:47,360
 take this from this house, put it in your car and don't ever talk with me about this again.

774
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:54,960
 And she was shocked because she didn't know that the classified area must have had something very

775
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:01,320
 intimately to do with the subjects in an alien harvest, which was about animal mutilations,

776
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:08,880
 extraterrestrials, law enforcement and medical research in something that the government denies.

777
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,800
 And that is happening in so many ways where people become so intimidated

778
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,680
 that they will not even accept the book.

779
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,680
 >> I think I'm okay.

780
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,240
 >> Thank you.

782
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,880
 >> So this is the close of day one.

783
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,600
 We have four more days.

784
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,360
 And I want to compliment all of you out there in the audience.

785
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,640
 I guess your audience, your participants as far as I can tell.

786
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,000
 And you stayed all day.

787
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,200
 And I hope you're here all the way through Friday because you are amazing.

788
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,600
 And our witnesses have been great.
