1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
 Thank you very much, sir. I think in our first session we did a pretty good job in terms

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,040
 of what's happened to you guys, and you can always, you military servants, you can hear

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,080
 by our questioning that we're very concerned, and I'm sure the entire Congress would be.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,560
 I'd like to use this time to talk more about the incident, what actually happened, if it

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,400
 was any recordings, if you took any notes, and anything else you might help to educate

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,880
 us in terms of what we're looking at in line with what this hearing is about.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,200
 And I think I'll just go down the line here. I think I'd like to do Mr. Pope first. Frascona,

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,160
 second, and then we'll have the two servicemen. Mr. Pope.

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:52,040
 Thank you, Madam Chair. We have, I guess, a significant problem in terms of the evidence

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,520
 record that despite the fact that the Ministry of Defence case file has now been declassified

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:06,360
 and released, and you'll have some of the papers, the document that I referred to dated

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,600
 February the 16th, in the final paragraph where it mentions that General Gabrielle visited

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:22,020
 the base, papers relating to that visit have not yet been located, and it's my hope that

14
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,280
 this would be perhaps the key in unlocking not just John and Jim's quest for their medical

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,800
 records, but perhaps a wider revelation of what it is that we're dealing with, because

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,960
 clearly if the Commander-in-Chief, United States Air Force, visited, and we know exactly

17
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,480
 because of that document, the time scale, it must be between the date of the incident

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:52,320
 itself and 16th of February, people, whether they be journalists or attorneys or whoever,

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,080
 have a very narrow window of time to go after the paper trail that must exist, clearly must

20
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,880
 exist, showing why such a senior United States Air Force officer visited those bases, and

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,680
 it seems to me that there must be questions that could be asked along the lines of, "May

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,760
 we have the paperwork relating to the General's visit, to the items of evidence which were

23
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,200
 removed, presumably back to his headquarters at Ramstein, to any investigation that was

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:33,680
 done either at Ramstein or by headquarters, USAAF or DOD, or indeed by any other agency."

25
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,000
 So I think there is this possibility that armed with the declassified Ministry of Defense

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,840
 document, we now know what we want.

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
 That's a good point.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
 That's a good point.

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,440
 Can you speak a bit about the aircraft itself, the aircraft itself, and if there were any

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,640
 presence of any life, any different things in your investigations?

31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
 Can you share with the committee anything along those lines?

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,760
 Well, I think what I would say is that the sketch of the craft and the sketch of the

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,640
 symbols that you have, and Jim can, when you question him, doubtless elaborate on this,

34
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,160
 I believe came from Jim Peniston's police notebook, his Air Force police notebook.

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,520
 And again, he'll correct me if I'm wrong on this, but he did as well as the photographs

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:35,500
 that he took, did some sketches, and then did a slightly more sanitized version, which

37
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,160
 you have in front of him, in front of you, when he'd stopped shaking.

38
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,040
 Does that exist now, Mr. Pendleton?

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,680
 Is there a notebook and pictures and all that, or does the military have that?

40
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,320
 I do have my own notebook, and it's in my possession.

41
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,760
 The chances of that notebook surviving are probably one in a thousand.

42
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
 Surviving what?

43
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,640
 About not being thrown away or -- By you?

44
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
 Sure.

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
 You're going to throw it away?

46
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,680
 Well, at the time, it was like I wanted the whole situation to go away, so --

47
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
 Well, but it's here.

48
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,880
 The only thing that's gone is your medical records at this point.

49
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
 Yeah, I know.

50
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
 I know.

51
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,920
 I mean, I think -- please don't throw it away.

52
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,480
 No, at the time, that's what I was -- I threw it in a drawer, and I didn't exercise proper

53
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,120
 care with it, and I found it four years later, it tells you I'm a pack rat.

54
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,360
 Four years later, after we PCS'd, came back to the States, and then I said, "Well, I better

55
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
 keep that."

56
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
 I think you better hold onto that.

57
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
 Yeah.

58
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,440
 It's just for prosperity as well as it's part of your life and a lot of history that's unfolding,

59
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,280
 so it would be -- it would behoove you to hold onto a pod we put in a safety deposit

60
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,720
 box and that kind of holding on, I don't mean just in a dresser drawer.

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
 I'm serious.

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
 No, it's no longer a dresser drawer.

63
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
 Yeah.

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,720
 No, I think you preserve it because it's historical, and you may be rewarded more than you think

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
 with it.

66
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,440
 You know, testing done and all that stuff for the -- people want it dated, I guess.

67
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,680
 But those -- everybody carried notebooks back then at the --

68
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,440
 Everybody didn't have your experience.

69
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,400
 Well, we were -- what we did it for is to record for reports.

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
 Yes.

71
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,200
 You know, I'm trying to keep everything rational and procedural like I was used to, so how

72
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
 am I going to explain all this?

73
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
 I'm writing this down.

74
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
 Exactly.

75
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,600
 And that's required, actually, as you were in charge that night, that you would take

76
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,160
 as much documentation as you could so that you could prepare an adequate report.

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,120
 That's how that works, I'm sure.

78
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
 Okay.

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
 Mr. Pope, are you done?

80
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
 Yes.

81
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
 Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
 Okay.

83
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
 Attorney?

84
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
 Counselor?

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
 Yes.

86
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
 Anything you want to add?

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
 Madam Chair, thank you.

88
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,560
 I have to say that as far as the importance of the evidence or what I can say about that

89
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
 is this.

90
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,400
 The first several many years of my legal career was spent as a public defender, and as such,

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,880
 I went to court every day as the underdog, pretty much, and oftentimes didn't have any

92
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,920
 real evidence in my favor other than human testimony, witness testimony.

93
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,040
 And I gained a respect for, much like I'm sure each of you have through hearings such

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:18,760
 as this today, that the testimony that you hear from your fellow man or woman can be

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,640
 just as good if not better than documentary evidence much of the time.

96
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:30,000
 In this particular case, I have had the privilege of being privy to some conversations that

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,720
 John and Jim have had with some of the folks, rather, we've spoken about today, some of

98
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,320
 those rather high-ranking people, and nobody's telling or describing the sight of the smoking

99
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:51,600
 gun to this, but just by what they say and how they react to certain questions and what

100
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,040
 they might add to an answer at the very end that they give it some thought tends to point

101
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,560
 in a certain direction.

102
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,880
 All the arrows point in one direction, and that's not necessarily ET or Black Ops Project,

103
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:14,080
 but it points to something very strange, and I've seen that a number of times.

104
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,240
 But I guess I would say that if this were a case, if I went back to be that Young Republic

105
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,760
 defender I was so many years ago, this would have been one of my best criminal cases to

106
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,920
 take because the testimony is all there for me to win that case, absolutely.

107
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,520
 The main thing you'd be dealing with today that you would not be if they weren't not

108
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,000
 military and regular citizens is the military, which is much of what this whole disclosure

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 hearing is about.

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,760
 But that's good, and we commend you for that.

111
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,920
 Public defenders are major in our society, and when you have a passion that I feel from

112
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,200
 you for them, they get good representation, so thank you very much.

113
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,880
 Mr. Pendleton, would you like to add anything else before I go to my members here?

114
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,960
 >> Do you have any questions that -- I was wondering, are your questions going to go

115
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
 into the cover-up?

116
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
 >> We'll have to see.

117
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,440
 Each of these members are leaders in their own right, but they're all going to get a

118
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
 chance.

119
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,680
 They're going to get some, because, you know, we could be here, you know, they'll come to

120
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
 it, though.

121
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,960
 Did you want to say something about the cover-up?

122
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,880
 >> Well, it's -- it'll take -- it'll take quite a while, that's why.

123
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,320
 >> Well, I want you to paraphrase, because one thing about it, you've lived it, you were

124
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,480
 there, you're here with us today, and whatever you'd like to offer, you should start.

125
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:35,520
 >> I think that in a -- because of the culture and the environment at the time of the Air

126
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:43,060
 Force after Blue Book, it wasn't prudent or good career moves to be talking about any

127
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,520
 type of phenomenon or UFOs or things like that.

128
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,560
 It just wasn't a good idea for your career.

129
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:57,240
 So when John and I left that for us that night, we were discussing, well, how far do we go

130
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
 with this?

131
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
 And tell them everything?

132
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,000
 You know, well, it would be pretty much a career ender, we were thinking that.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,440
 So we reported in the next day with our shift commander the morning after, and we told him

134
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,080
 about what happened, and he questioned us on it, and we were somewhat sanitized.

135
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:22,360
 I mean, instead of being up next to a craft, I was at a distance, you know, it was metallic,

136
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,440
 you know, those kind of things.

137
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,240
 And he says, "This is just not a good idea to report this."

138
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,880
 He says, "I think we should let it go -- you know, just let it go away."

139
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,080
 So when I was taken down to OSI, I called on the OSI to make my report, I went in there,

140
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,720
 and the thoughts of preserving my career were -- they went away, because I was scared to

141
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
 death of the OSI.

142
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,280
 They were just threatening me down there.

143
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,640
 They said, you know, in the way they do it, it's a good cop, bad cop, that kind of thing.

144
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,720
 And I went down there, and they said, "If you write everything that happened, don't

145
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,000
 leave anything out, this goes away."

146
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,240
 Okay, that's exactly what I want to have happen.

147
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,080
 I want this to go away.

148
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
 And so I did.

149
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:17,280
 I wrote out four long pages of documents, my statement on the legal paper.

150
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:29,080
 They came back in about 20, 25 minutes, and they have a typed half-page document that

151
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,400
 is out now on the Internet, and they say it's my statement.

152
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
 >> History Channel.

153
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
 The History Channel.

154
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,520
 >> They're out all over it.

155
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,000
 It's not my statement.

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,160
 In there it says that I got within 50 feet.

157
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:50,280
 It says it's a metallic object, and it's very, very, very general.

158
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,560
 And the agent says -- and I'm not sure if these are OSI agents, but I was in the OSI

159
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
 building.

160
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
 Let me clarify that too.

161
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,960
 I knew all the agents, but I didn't know these people.

162
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,120
 And they said, "Okay, read this statement."

163
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
 And I said, "Okay."

164
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
 And he said, "Read it again."

165
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,820
 I said, "Okay."

166
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,800
 And they said, "We want you to memorize it.

167
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
 Read it again."

168
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
 I said, "Okay."

169
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,280
 And he said, "This is the official statement that you're going to give your command element

170
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,560
 or anybody else from this point on that asks about it, because this is a classified investigation,

171
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,280
 and OSI can operate outside the chain of command.

172
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,040
 They do it over in England.

173
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,300
 At that time they actually worked for the State Department."

174
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
 And I said, "Okay.

175
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,300
 No problem."

176
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,600
 General orders by -- because it's an active investigation by whoever those are -- people

177
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,320
 in front of me.

178
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,480
 And so that's why I report to the Wing Commander.

179
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,200
 He doesn't even blink an eye when General Williams does it.

180
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
 He said, "Listen --"

181
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
 General Williams is the Wing Commander at that point.

182
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,800
 General -- Major General Williams, that's what he -- at the time he was Colonel Williams.

183
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,040
 You retired a Major General.

184
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,640
 And when we reported into Colonel Halt's office, I briefly talked to Colonel Conrad, who was

185
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,320
 the base commander at the time -- Colonel Halt worked for him.

186
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,520
 And then John and I met up there, and then we went in and talked to the Wing Commander

187
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:21,960
 -- reported into the Wing Commander -- and explained the -- I gave him the OSI statement.

188
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,800
 I mean, I told him that's what happened.

189
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:35,280
 It was general, and he thanked us very much for our time and told us that he appreciated

190
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
 the candor that we had.

191
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,240
 And he never asked one question.

192
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,440
 And so there's where the cover-up probably started.

193
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,360
 It started by the issuance of that statement from OSI.

194
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,440
 You submitted -- Sergeant, you submitted that statement, so it really kind of started as

195
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,560
 you were writing the statement and submitting it.

196
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,560
 Well, when I wrote the four pages -- I'll let me make that clear, ma'am -- when I wrote

197
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
 them out, I was in detail.

198
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
 I wrote down everything.

199
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
 But that wasn't what you submitted.

200
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,960
 You submitted what they asked you to submit.

201
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,280
 I gave them everything they wanted.

202
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,840
 They said write every detail down.

203
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
 Four pages?

204
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,320
 Four pages.

205
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,220
 And I wrote the fact about the temperature, about it being on the ground, the glyphs,

206
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,520
 the notes from my notebook.

207
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
 They were included.

208
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,920
 I didn't have my notebook there, but all that stuff was included, including the binary code,

209
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,640
 which I called ones and zeros in because I'm not a math person.

210
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,000
 And at that time -- And did you give that to the wing commander?

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,960
 I gave that to the OSI building.

212
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,800
 Did you give that to the wing commander?

213
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
 No.

214
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 No, ma'am.

215
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,640
 What I gave to the wing commander was the OSI sanitized statement and the one that I

216
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
 was supposed to give them.

217
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,160
 And why did you not give that one to the wing commander?

218
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,720
 Because I was under orders from -- because OSI said it was an ongoing investigation and

219
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
 they can work outside the realm of the base commander, wing commander and everything else

220
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
 like that.

221
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,920
 And my position is, new with this and all that, that might have been the beginning of

222
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
 the cover-up.

223
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
 Yes.

224
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
 I agree.

225
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
 All right.

226
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
 Thank you.

227
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
 And I don't want to badger you.

228
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,240
 Appreciate your service, trying times.

229
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
 How many years ago was this?

230
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,240
 This is '80 and this is now '13.

231
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,520
 That's 23, 33 years ago, so no.

232
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,200
 That you're still standing in relatively good health, thank God for that and we'll see what

233
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 we can do with you.

234
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
 Thank you, ma'am.

235
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
 Thank you, sir.

236
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
 Mr. Burroughs.

237
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,560
 Yes, ma'am.

238
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,200
 What stands out to me is the fact that you had an incident take place over three nights

239
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,760
 at the largest attack fighter wing in the Air Force at the time.

240
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:51,920
 You had over three flights involved and probably well over 150 personnel that were aware of

241
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,960
 something going on, whether they were listening to it on the radio, whether they were observing

242
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,640
 something from their location or were actually up close and personal with whatever was out

243
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,040
 there.

244
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,440
 How many times has something come back three nights in a row?

245
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,440
 I've seen very little evidence involving the UFO community where something comes back more

246
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,960
 than once.

247
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,740
 We had the distinct pleasure of having something visit us three times.

248
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,800
 As you said, a cover-up began immediately.

249
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,440
 It drew the attention of somebody because a C-5 came in on Sunday night.

250
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,320
 What was reported was a team from Langley Air Force Base that had their own helicopters,

251
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,800
 their own vehicles and their own security.

252
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,880
 They cordoned the force off.

253
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,840
 I was posted on the gate on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and my orders were, because

254
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,480
 I was already involved in the incident, that you'd be aware that some strange things could

255
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,840
 possibly be going on.

256
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,160
 If I saw anything happen, it was my job to not report it on the radio but to call it

257
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,880
 in on the phone.

258
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,420
 Don't get alarmed by anything that could be going on, but if there's something of extreme

259
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,480
 importance, call it in on the phone.

260
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,360
 So we had a team out there investigating what we were involved with.

261
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:20,800
 What's also interesting to me is the fact that it was off base and that wasn't our property

262
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,920
 that the United States Air Force was given the lead on this investigation.

263
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,880
 Why is that?

264
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,560
 What did they already know?

265
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,040
 Was there something that keyed them into whatever we were involved with?

266
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,820
 Why would they send a team in from Langley to investigate this?

267
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,240
 From there, after the investigation was concluded with the team and they departed, there was

268
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,080
 all kinds of rumors of what was going on.

269
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,600
 What Sergeant Pennison and I did, what we were told to do, is to remain quiet.

270
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,420
 But over the years, different personnel have come forward and been interviewed about what

271
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,600
 took place.

272
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,560
 Different things have come up as far as what was seen.

273
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:08,360
 What's clear, and I'm not going to hold anything back on this, almost everybody involved saw

274
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,200
 something different.

275
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,420
 They reported something different.

276
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,340
 They reported different things that they felt and what went on.

277
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,800
 There was static electricity in the air.

278
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,920
 There was problems with equipment.

279
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:31,480
 And yet, after all this went on, none of us were ever brought in and officially debriefed.

280
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,120
 None of us were ever taken care of or checked out medically.

281
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,000
 But none of us were relieved of duty.

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,320
 And just recently in the past two years, the deputy base commander at the time, who then

283
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,320
 was promoted to colonel, ended up being base commander at that and other locations, came

284
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,800
 out and went on the record and said what he saw out there, he felt, was of intelligence,

285
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,000
 was under intelligence control.

286
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,960
 One of the questions that's come up to me over the years is was it us?

287
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,920
 Was it somewhere else or could it be both?

288
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,800
 I believe what we were looking at out there on those three nights was something that was

289
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:17,320
 going on both with us and whatever we were doing drew something in that created a reaction.

290
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,280
 And I believe this case could be the defining case in the history of UFOs that might be

291
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
 able to break this open if there's people that are willing to take charge of this in

292
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
 a position of power and look into this.

293
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
 Thank you.

294
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
 Very well spoken.

295
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
 Thank you very much.

296
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,160
 Thank you very much.

297
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:43,680
 Congressman Bartlett, please.

298
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,600
 There had to be an official investigation of this.

299
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:59,440
 Do we have any idea where the records of this are?

300
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:07,800
 My best assessment, sir, is that the start point was General Gabriel, commander in chief

301
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:15,720
 United States Air Force in Europe, but whether his staff after his visit conducted the investigation

302
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,680
 or whether his staff then handed off the investigation to somebody else.

303
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,640
 I don't know that, sir, but at least having the start point, it should enable Freedom

304
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,360
 of Information Act requests to say if you don't have those records, who does?

305
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,120
 Is it my understanding that when he left, he took with him some of the documentation?

306
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,080
 Yes, sir.

307
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,380
 It was the custom and practice of the deputy base commander, Charles Holt, to take with

308
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:53,040
 him a handheld cassette recorder on which he documented his thoughts and observations.

309
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,480
 It's that tape recording, which is now in the public domain, that is referred to in

310
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,440
 the document has been taken back to Ramstein.

311
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,440
 What the document does not say and itemize is what else he took back, but we know for

312
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:15,500
 example from testimony of others involved that there were things such as soil samples

313
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:25,600
 that went somewhere, samples I believe from the damaged trees that were facing this craft,

314
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,560
 and indeed whatever documentation the general may have taken with him.

315
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:39,620
 You were there when the craft took off, sergeants?

316
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,440
 There was no sound or was there sound?

317
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:50,840
 When the craft generated, it did generate more lighting and that concerned me.

318
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:57,200
 I wasn't sure it was going to explode or I wasn't really sure about that.

319
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,640
 So I did take a somewhat defensive position and it rose off the ground.

320
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,920
 With that, it went up to tree level and momentary hovered and then took off in the blink of an

321
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
 eye.

322
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,760
 The things that it didn't do was stuff that it should have done, at least that's what

323
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,020
 I was hoping at the time.

324
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,960
 I was hoping for air displacement, all aircraft do that from the engines.

325
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,800
 I was hoping for aircraft sound, all aircraft do that.

326
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:36,580
 I was hoping for those type of things that would occur.

327
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,120
 One of the things that stopped after it reached a certain point was the static, the feeling

328
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,160
 of clothing in that, that did stop.

329
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,800
 It did it with silence.

330
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,080
 I also made an observation that I figured it was intelligence.

331
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,920
 I mean, I'm not saying it's manned, it's too small for that.

332
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:05,640
 What I'm saying that when a craft will momentarily hover or an object and if it turns to the

333
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,080
 right, that tells me it's intelligent, controlling it of some kind.

334
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,040
 A drone doesn't just sit there and go, why bother, it would take off and then go make

335
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,760
 the flight plan or whatever it wanted to do.

336
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,120
 So that was odd.

337
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,760
 And to this day, I have not seen any technology that would even come close to replicating

338
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,840
 the technology that I observed that night.

339
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,240
 As a matter of fact, if the United States had that kind of technology, you could probably

340
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,400
 cut your defense budget in half and not have to worry about a thing.

341
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:47,400
 That would be the key of Pax Americana or whatever, peace under American control.

342
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,360
 But yeah, that's, are we going to go back to the cover-up part of it or, I really have

343
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,840
 some issues with the cover-up.

344
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,840
 >> You know, this is your time, Sergeant, we're here, we invited you to come to testify and

345
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,100
 the members are trying to gain information.

346
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,920
 I'm going to let him finish and then I'm going to get back to you, okay?

347
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,920
 >> Relative to the cover-up, it obviously started pretty quickly because you were told

348
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:22,320
 to sign an abbreviated sanitized statement that put you far enough away from the craft

349
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:31,200
 that it could be interpreted as hallucination or reflections or something like that.

350
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:39,280
 Other than the exchange you had when that sanitized abbreviated statement was prepared,

351
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,440
 were you ever interrogated as to the details of what you saw?

352
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,040
 >> That's interesting.

353
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,280
 The first, the only time I remember, consciously remember being interviewed, that's a nice

354
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,800
 way to put it, by, at the OSI building was on, I believe it was the Monday, Monday after

355
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
 the incident.

356
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,240
 The incident happened on a weekend and I believe it was Monday or Tuesday when I was called

357
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
 in there.

358
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:16,400
 So that, and that's right now my statement and all that, but under hypnosis in 1994,

359
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,800
 it's apparently around February 1st of that year it was noted in the hypnosis that I was

360
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:31,560
 taken back into the OSI building or it could have been the Wing Intel, I'm not sure, and

361
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:38,320
 also interrogated at that point again and that one was where I was administered sodium

362
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:48,000
 penethol which is a very graphic thing to watch on film and additional questions were

363
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,160
 asked and additional discoveries were made.

364
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:05,360
 >> Why personally do you think there was an interest in cover up?

365
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:13,000
 >> Well there's, I think, John alluded to it a little bit earlier, I think part of the

366
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,080
 problem there was, they were drawn into the area, this object was drawn there because

367
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:26,660
 there was interest in the area and the interest has to do with a top secret facility which

368
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:34,680
 I later wrote security plans for and stuff at that base which was Marvisham Heath, it

369
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:43,440
 was a C3 facility, communications, and it had a building there that at the time had

370
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,940
 a retinal eye scanner, in 1980 that's like high tech stuff and you don't really waste

371
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,800
 your money, the government's money on those kind of things over there like that but that

372
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,360
 was the unusual part of it so there was operations within there and they were civilian by the

373
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,320
 way, none of those people were wearing uniforms and then just down the street from that another

374
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:11,760
 mile and a half or two was MI6, British intelligence that operated out of there and then of course

375
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:19,840
 we had the control towers that were strategically placed around the base too that operated radar

376
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,560
 systems and the communications.

377
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,960
 It's also a part, and I think John should talk a little bit about, if you don't mind

378
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,800
 talking a little bit about Cobra Mist, do you want to talk about that?

379
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 >> Okay.

380
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 >> Yeah.

381
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:42,040
 So this is documented, it's on the internet, before our incident there was a project called

382
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:49,280
 Cobra Mist, I don't know if any of you are aware of it but it was over the horizon radar.

383
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:56,080
 The Russians had their project called Woodpecker and there was activity going on between both

384
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,760
 sides trying to counteract this particular technology.

385
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,760
 What's interesting is and it's posted right in the, why it was shut down was when they

386
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,560
 posted Cobra Mist on the coast and by the way the NSA had a facility there with Cobra

387
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,200
 Mist was the fact that it didn't work properly.

388
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,040
 They brought in the Stanford Research Institute to find out why it didn't work properly, okay.

389
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,120
 What they determined was that there was something coming from inside the country that was keeping

390
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,320
 it from working properly.

391
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,980
 They had spent a lot of money on this project and they just shut it down almost immediately

392
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,280
 after that.

393
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,040
 But the thing was the people that work on Cobra Mist, civilians and military, and the

394
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,980
 Stanford Research Institute never left.

395
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:52,440
 They were moved on to Bentwaters, Woodbridge, and it marrows from Heath.

396
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,720
 So what appears to happen was whatever they were working on at the time, they came to

397
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,520
 realize something else was going on in the area, and they continued to work forward with

398
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,480
 whatever project they were working on at the time.

399
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,120
 There obviously had to be a lot of discussion about what had happened there.

400
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,320
 There are three fairly obvious possibilities.

401
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,060
 One was it was an experimental something we were doing.

402
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:25,000
 It was something the Soviets were doing or it was extraterrestrial.

403
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Which of those was the general consensus?

404
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 For the rest of the base?

405
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Sir?

406
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,040
 You mean for what the rest of the base?

407
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
 Well, yeah.

408
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,880
 There had to be a lot of discussion as to what went on out there.

409
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
 No.

410
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,140
 Things were shut down?

411
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,400
 The discussion was limited.

412
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,080
 Anybody that was in the know was told it was classified.

413
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
 You don't talk about it.

414
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,180
 Anybody that wasn't in the know talked about it.

415
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,200
 How quickly were you told that?

416
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,560
 That was the morning.

417
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,640
 It started almost immediately with the shift commander continued on with the fact.

418
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,440
 Also one other note that we confirmed through the controller who was in charge of writing

419
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,440
 up the reports that day, all the documents were immediately classified secret.

420
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,920
 What's interesting is CNN, Chuck DeCaro, special assignments reporter, attempted to do a report

421
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:20,720
 on the incident, and when he asked for the incident reports, the 1569s and the blot entries

422
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,800
 on this, do you want to know what his answer was given to him?

423
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
 They disappeared.

424
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 They're lost.

425
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
 Somebody took them.

426
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,260
 We don't know where they are.

427
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,000
 Did they give you an indication why they were classifying it?

428
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,440
 Let me give you one last question.

429
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,280
 Any indication why they were classifying it?

430
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
 No.

431
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,320
 At the time, you've got to remember 1980 we were young airmen.

432
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:51,120
 Today, yeah, we have a general idea why it was probably classified.

433
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,420
 Well it's because they wanted to cover it up as a general consensus.

434
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,080
 At that time, they had to have some explanation why you classify it.

435
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
 Security?

436
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
 No.

437
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
 We were not in the need to know.

438
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,120
 We didn't have the clearance level or the authority to ask why.

439
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,400
 We were told to shut up and color.

440
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:15,080
 Some of the other evidence that was taken, I would assume would be taken by General Gabriel,

441
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,800
 because in the Wing Command Post, it's a hardened shelter on Bantwaters, our control center

442
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,920
 for up-channeling, helping hands cover wagons, these are code words for security reports,

443
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:32,160
 down-channel reports, you know, DEFCON 3s, those kind of things.

444
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:40,540
 They have a, at the time, a reel-to-reel, and they would record all of the radio transmissions

445
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,880
 on our four channels, I believe we had four, a command net and I think an LA net and a

446
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,840
 couple others, and they would record all that.

447
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
 Those things, like that, that's a smoking gun.

448
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,080
 That actually had our radio transmissions and what was transpiring over the net.

449
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
 Those were taken.

450
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:05,260
 The 1569, which is a complaint and incident report, which is once you make a blotter entry,

451
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:12,840
 it's a more detailed report that you write out from your notes, and that would go on

452
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
 record.

453
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,160
 But we were told by the senior controller, and that was Sergeant Coffey, that those were

454
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:27,320
 immediately pulled from CSC, Central Security Control, and classified secret.

455
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:37,600
 So that was another step toward the containment efforts to have it quieted down and in some

456
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,480
 more misdirection.

457
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,200
 I'm still holding off on the cover-up.

458
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,280
 I really am biting at the bit on that one.

459
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,280
 You've done that pretty well, but you just mentioned another opportunity to discuss something,

460
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,120
 and I didn't write it down, so I'm kind of, what else did I, I said I was going to yield

461
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,560
 back to you to ask, you ask, are we going to talk about cover-up?

462
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:01,160
 Well, it's here to see, when we're told everything's classified, and anybody else that was involved

463
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,820
 is classified, don't talk about it, and we take that seriously, and it'll protect our

464
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,120
 country's interests.

465
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:17,880
 Then they decided to make cover stories, and the brilliance of the United States Air Force

466
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,920
 and cover stories, I love it.

467
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,960
 They said that it was alien.

468
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,920
 They said it was E.T. related.

469
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,240
 They said they had floating stuff, and all this other stuff was said.

470
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,720
 It was a UFO, and with little green men, basically.

471
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
 That's what they said it was.

472
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
 So-

473
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
 Was it?

474
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
 Absolutely not.

475
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
 It was a craft of unknown origin.

476
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,160
 I wasn't able to determine the origin of the craft.

477
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,580
 When it comes down to investigations, ma'am, we take our job seriously.

478
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,760
 We only report the facts as we see them.

479
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,960
 There's no conjecture.

480
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,000
 We have other people that can look at those things, assess the situation.

481
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,280
 My main issue I had that night, I knew it was an aircraft crash, I just said that because

482
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:17,040
 we lost contact with a bogey about 15 minutes prior to them reporting it and getting me

483
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,520
 to the gate.

484
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:27,940
 I was thinking it was more of a security situation out there.

485
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:33,640
 We had around 160, I believe it was six squadrons of A-10 tank killers there.

486
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,960
 We had 10,000 people working on that base live there.

487
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,860
 We had munitions storage, sensitive weapon systems.

488
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,240
 We had C-3 facilities.

489
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,440
 We had part of the Cobra Mist team that we can't go in those areas.

490
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,360
 We had other mission requirements that still remain classified today.

491
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:03,140
 My job was to ascertain if it was a threat to the security, the war-making capability

492
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,420
 of that base.

493
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,280
 That was what I was doing out there.

494
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,880
 Everything we put in a report, it's all facts.

495
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:20,440
 You don't elude to, even though I must admit, I knew this thing wasn't like in the James

496
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,200
 book of known aircraft, I said it had to be some kind of technology that was beyond what

497
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,680
 we could produce at the time.

498
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,960
 I mean, yeah, those thoughts went through my mind.

499
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,720
 But do I report it as such?

500
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
 No.

501
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
 No.

502
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
 I stuck to the facts.

503
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,000
 The fact that you saw something not normal in your training and your experience, and

504
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,680
 you wrote that in a three or four page memo, what you saw and what you experienced.

505
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,080
 I wrote that in my statement, ma'am.

506
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
 Yes, ma'am.

507
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,680
 What you gave to the wing commander was something less than that.

508
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,680
 Yes.

509
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,200
 I felt really guilty about that.

510
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,600
 About giving the other one or writing the first one?

511
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,560
 Well, there's a loyalty thing going on here, too.

512
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,640
 I mean, I'm under orders, but that's my wing commander.

513
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,840
 That's my base commander.

514
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:13,440
 I have an obligation always to protect them and to follow their orders and not tell them

515
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,700
 anything that's not true.

516
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,960
 And here I have orders at the OSI building saying, "You're going to go ahead and give

517
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,200
 this statement to your command element or anybody else ask about it."

518
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,760
 I lived with that for about 31 years, and I had the opportunity to talk to Major General

519
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,720
 Williams, Gordon Williams, and that was one of the things I brought up.

520
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,520
 And he says, "Don't worry about it.

521
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
 Following orders."

522
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,360
 He says, "I know how it was.

523
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,280
 I know what happened.

524
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,000
 I understand you weren't treated it fairly."

525
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,880
 He says, "I'm here.

526
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880
 What do you need from me?"

527
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
 Okay.

528
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,600
 Let's hold that one right there.

529
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,320
 Your point's well taken, and the more you talk, the more it is coming out.

530
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,280
 We've heard several incidences.

531
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,840
 Roswell has nothing on this that we hear, and we're going to hear Roswell tomorrow.

532
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
 Very cousins probably.

533
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,400
 I mean, the incidents, sisters, brothers, or whatever.

534
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,160
 But I feel your passion and your pain, and 30 years plus is a long time.

535
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,840
 And now to be in a situation where you can't get health care because of your -- it's way

536
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,440
 bigger than the two of you, and I know you know that by now.

537
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,080
 But let us continue to get the information we need to make intelligent decisions.

538
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
 But we're here to work.

539
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,680
 You're not just going to see us just for the day.

540
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,680
 Take our names.

541
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,880
 We'll help and work with you as well, but we're going to get it back to that congress

542
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,760
 that you work for.

543
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,400
 Who works for you, I should say.

544
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,320
 Congresswoman Walsley, please.

545
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:47,320
 Well, Sergeant Pennison, I'll leave you more time for your cover-up if you want.

546
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,840
 I mean, it doesn't sound like you feel like you're finished, but I did have a question.

547
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,600
 You mentioned sodium pentothal.

548
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,920
 Yes, ma'am.

549
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:04,480
 Was that administered during your VA as part of the hypnosis or during the intelligence

550
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,880
 control or the OSI?

551
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:19,240
 In 1994, when I was out of the service, retired, I went to a therapist and she put me under

552
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
 that.

553
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,800
 And that's when you told your story, went way back and told the whole thing that you

554
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
 had?

555
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
 That's correct, ma'am.

556
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
 Okay.

557
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,320
 And it said that I had additional visits and being interrogated.

558
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,240
 And that's where they came out about the sodium pentothal.

559
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,320
 It wasn't a memory that I had.

560
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,680
 Oh, so the sodium pentothal was when?

561
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:53,920
 When to the hypnosis in 1994 that was done on February 1st, 1981, or there about give

562
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,720
 or take a few days.

563
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,880
 During the OSI interrogation?

564
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,720
 Yes, but I knew all the OSI agents.

565
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,000
 These individuals were not OSI.

566
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,320
 They were American.

567
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
 One was British.

568
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
 Okay.

569
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
 The interrogation.

570
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:19,720
 That seems a little strange, didn't that make you feel like you were the guilty one?

571
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
 Yes.

572
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,800
 Like something happened and you made it, wouldn't you have told them everything you knew without

573
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
 it?

574
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:36,200
 Well, it shouldn't surprise you, ma'am, that the government's not always honest.

575
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,560
 We wanted it to go away.

576
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,600
 They said that if we went and were completely honest with them and upfront, this would go

577
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
 away.

578
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
 Great.

579
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,760
 That's what we wanted.

580
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
 But it didn't go away.

581
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,040
 Apparently, on our hypnosis, they continued to go ahead and interrogate us like we're

582
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
 prisoners of war.

583
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,360
 As a matter of fact, I think there's laws against doing that to prisoners of war, okay?

584
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,280
 The sodium pentothal, I must agree to it.

585
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,160
 I don't think they would have just gave it to me.

586
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,560
 I'm thinking, I can guess.

587
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,020
 I can say, well, maybe they wanted to make sure I was telling the truth.

588
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,560
 Maybe that was it.

589
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,960
 Maybe they want to make sure that this wasn't a fabrication of a story or something like

590
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
 that.

591
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,660
 Maybe that's what they wanted to do.

592
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:30,240
 But on our hypnosis, it came out to be more of a they knew things and there's things they

593
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,720
 wanted to know that didn't seem to make any difference to anything.

594
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,800
 But they had a general knowledge that this has been going on for a while and there's

595
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:50,760
 been a concerted effort to deceive the people on it, the public.

596
00:39:50,760 --> 00:40:03,320
 And do you want to offer any more on that subject of deceiving the copyright?

597
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:12,360
 Well, I'm not sure who was actually in charge pulling the strings on this.

598
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,560
 I don't know if it was the NSA.

599
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,840
 I don't know if it was DIS, Defense Intelligence Service.

600
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,960
 They were down at Chick-Sans, which is 50 miles away.

601
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,360
 So I'm not exactly sure who they were.

602
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,920
 I don't even know if they were from the embassy.

603
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,600
 They could have been State Department, who knows?

604
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:39,540
 But the other thing is that most of the people all PCS'd, permanent change of station, within

605
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,040
 three months of the incident.

606
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,840
 I'm not saying it was something that was by design.

607
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,000
 I'm saying that's what happened, though.

608
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,240
 Myself, on February 1st, I got promotion.

609
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,800
 I became the non-commissioned officer in charge of plans and programs.

610
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,760
 We wrote top-seeker plans, contingency planning, those kind of things for time-phased appointment

611
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,520
 listings, stuff like that, and how we'd fight the war and different wars and different scenarios.

612
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:18,200
 And I wrote the base security plans, and I worked under the direct observation in some

613
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,420
 capacity of the base commander.

614
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
 Why would that happen?

615
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,760
 I didn't know nothing about plans and programs, ma'am.

616
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,060
 I was a security force member.

617
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,560
 They said, "Well, we'll educate you.

618
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,880
 We'll send you there for the next six months of classes or something."

619
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,520
 They wanted to watch me, so I stayed there with Colonel Halt until 1984.

620
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,080
 And of course, I hear scuttlebutt.

621
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,680
 I hear people talking about the UFO incident and that, but there are people that weren't

622
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
 going to know.

623
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:55,440
 They just, you know, they were just listening to the false information that was put out.

624
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
 You have anything to add?

625
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,240
 I'd like to add a couple things of note that stands out to me.

626
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:07,000
 Number one, the State Department admits that there was something went on.

627
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,800
 And by doing that, there was an international incident involved, because why else would

628
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,760
 the Department of State be briefed?

629
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,040
 The OSI oversees reports to the Department of State.

630
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,360
 They don't report to local authorities.

631
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,960
 You know, in the states, it's a little bit different setup.

632
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,640
 So immediately, the Department of State was briefed on this.

633
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,680
 Why would they be briefed on this if nothing of significance took place?

634
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,640
 From that point, I've had the privilege of sitting down face to face with General Williams,

635
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,520
 Colonel Conrad, and Colonel Halt.

636
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,720
 Colonel Halt's on the record saying that he was aware that we were brought in and interrogated.

637
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,880
 He was aware that we were not treated properly and that there was drugs, or in his words,

638
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,280
 we were messed with.

639
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,720
 That's where my problem starts with my chain of command.

640
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,880
 Where were they for us when they knew this was going on and why didn't they stop it?

641
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,720
 General Williams, who we had a face to face with, said he tried to help us, but when our

642
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,240
 attorney contacted him and asked if he'd go on a record and do a statement as sworn subpoena,

643
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:12,720
 he said he'd have memory problems, that he would fail to forget -- he would have a problem

644
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,160
 remembering everything that went on.

645
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,320
 Colonel Conrad was most concerned about the fact that Colonel Halt has been on the record

646
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,640
 on a lot of this stuff.

647
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,320
 He said he violated the code of conduct by an officer, that basically he was out there

648
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,960
 talking about something that should stay quiet and remain classified.

649
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,160
 We clearly understand the fact that even in your position as you are given information

650
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,160
 is deemed national defense and classified.

651
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:49,040
 But what wasn't taken into effect, again, is what I stressed earlier, was a human factor.

652
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,160
 And does it really matter what we was deemed classified and that it needs to be maintained

653
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,240
 and held back from the general public?

654
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,120
 Why were we not given the care that we were supposed to receive and why weren't we at

655
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,360
 least briefed a little bit on what we were dealing with?

656
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,520
 Because besides the physical problems, which I have a pacemaker defibrillator in me now

657
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:18,360
 at 52, we are still puzzled by what we were dealing with and why it happened to us.

658
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
 I'll yield back.

659
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,360
 I'm sure I've used all my time.

660
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,360
 Thank you, gentlemen.

661
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,360
 Thank you.

662
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,360
 Senator Gravel?

663
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:33,960
 To your knowledge, were there any nuclear storage facilities within the area?

664
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:40,640
 I can neither confirm nor deny that, sir.

665
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,280
 What do you mean you can't confirm?

666
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,120
 Forget the classification stuff.

667
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,880
 This is quite a number of years.

668
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,880
 And just so you're comfortable, I was in the CIC in the Army, which is the equivalent of

669
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,200
 your OSI, and we interfaced with them greatly.

670
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,800
 So my question again is that you have knowledge that there was any storage area, and maybe

671
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,960
 Mr. Polk can elaborate upon it, that there may have been a conflict.

672
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,560
 You're not going to get any answers on me, so you better...

673
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
 Go ahead, Nick.

674
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,560
 You can explain.

675
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
 Nick, you step forward.

676
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,560
 You're a foreigner.

677
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,300
 We're not going to do anything to you.

678
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:25,920
 Was there an issue over nuclear storage and what was being stored?

679
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,120
 Well, sir, I checked the position with the Ministry of Defense Press Office, because

680
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,840
 this is a question that comes up from time to time.

681
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:42,000
 And I was told that if that question is asked, even about a historical incident, the British

682
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,360
 government's line on that is still, "Neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons."

683
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,360
 However, sir...

684
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,360
 Please.

685
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,360
 Yeah.

686
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:57,320
 Let's put the crap aside now and talk mono-amano.

687
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,480
 While I can't answer that question, I would refer you to, again, what Lord Hill Norton

688
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,480
 as the former Chief of the Defense Staff, which is the UK equivalent of the Chairman

689
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,480
 of the Joint Chiefs...

690
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
 What did he say?

691
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,560
 Basically, he said, "Look, this was a nuclear base."

692
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,720
 So that's what the Chief of the Defense Staff said and the Chairman of the Military Committee.

693
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,240
 Do you realize that all of that hoopla was over the fact that they didn't want the British

694
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:27,040
 people to know that we were storing nukes over there and that they would be reacting

695
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,320
 to it?

696
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,560
 That's what this is all about.

697
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:38,860
 But the tie-in for us here is the fact that you had extraterrestrial interest, which seems

698
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:44,040
 to be in what readings I've done in preparation for the hearing, that there's a lot of this

699
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:54,640
 stuff that was going on with ICBMs not functioning when these extraterrestrials are around and

700
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,600
 they take an interest, particularly...

701
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,400
 We had this yesterday in New Mexico, which was the center of our "defense posture" in

702
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,880
 that regard.

703
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,680
 That seems to be why they had an interest in it.

704
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,960
 So this is not rocket sanctuary and this is not terribly secret.

705
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,280
 The public knows about this.

706
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:27,640
 This has been highly discussed in international and political science records all over.

707
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,620
 We still had this problem in Okinawa.

708
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:35,060
 We still had this problem why we took nukes out of South Korea, because that's what triggered

709
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:41,520
 the North Koreans to start going nuke, was because we had nukes in the peninsula.

710
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,120
 And of course we still have nukes in Europe.

711
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:51,240
 So we can all bury our heads in the sand and say, "Oh, this is ha-ha, this is big secret."

712
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,920
 It's not a big secret.

713
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
 We know it.

714
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:00,560
 What's the secret is the treatment of people like yourself who are just doing your job

715
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:07,640
 at a level and then everybody in the chain of command are just lying through their teeth

716
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,600
 in what they think are good reasons, "Does this increase the defense of our country?"

717
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,640
 I don't know.

718
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,600
 But here, you answered my question so that you didn't have to say it, somebody else said

719
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,920
 it of record that there were nukes in, but I don't know about the others, but I certainly

720
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,040
 knew about it and I've been out of office for 40 years.

721
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:37,840
 Now let me reiterate, is there anything you want to fess up that you'll feel comfortable

722
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,400
 with and sleep better tonight if you tell us?

723
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:49,160
 Because there's no danger to you, trust me, there is no danger to you in this regard.

724
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,480
 You're out of the service, I don't know what you signed when you're there, but you have

725
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,000
 a moral responsibility like anybody else to tell the truth or share your knowledge with

726
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,160
 us because that's what we're all trying to get to, is a level of knowledge to the public

727
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,960
 so there'll be a reaction.

728
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:15,440
 Let me just intervene right here, Senator, contrary to some of the things that you said

729
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,080
 and we do want the truth as much as we can get it, but what we don't want to jeopardize

730
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,360
 anybody's safety or anything else, benefits included.

731
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,200
 So I think we're going to leave that chain of thought right there and let it just lay

732
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,720
 because what I don't want to see and as members of Congress, we have a classification, but

733
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,800
 there are two or three levels over us that we don't have.

734
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,320
 So you need to know that as well, there's different levels of, and I don't, whatever

735
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,680
 you said 35 years ago, I want, and that oath you took and signed that paper and gave them

736
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,360
 this instead of that, I think we've heard that, we've worked that enough today.

737
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,840
 But I want you to change, just change, change to continue, but just go somewhere else.

738
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,760
 Well, but let me dispute that a little bit, Congressman.

739
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:04,880
 First off, as far as I'm concerned, the members of Congress have the highest degree of classification

740
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,880
 of what's secret.

741
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,440
 Now, I'm not talking about order of battle where troops are put at risk because somebody

742
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,240
 blabs about something, but when I'm talking about, here, I'll give you an example.

743
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,440
 I had Edward Teller, I was a Senator for 30 days.

744
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:26,040
 Edward Teller is sitting in my office, and I barely passed Physics 101, and here's this

745
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,720
 awesome person, Edward Teller, trying to persuade me on an ABM system.

746
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,480
 And all I could think of was when I'm listening to him talk was that he probably knows more

747
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,080
 than I will ever know, or he's forgotten more than I will ever know on physics and the bomb

748
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,680
 and the nuclear stuff.

749
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:50,480
 But I'll tell you, I'm equal to him or to superior to him in the determination of whether

750
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,320
 we will use the bomb, period.

751
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,720
 And that goes for the members of Congress, and so when we talk about that we're bound

752
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,520
 by secrecy, let me tell you again, there's a Supreme Court decision, 1972, that any member

753
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,720
 of Congress can release any information on any subject of any classification level.

754
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,740
 I don't care if it's cosmic and cannot be questioned in any other location.

755
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:21,440
 That is the law of the land based on the Constitution and a Supreme Court backup decision on it.

756
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:30,560
 So we may have our differences in that regard, but I'll be happy to terminate it on that.

757
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,080
 But let me again, if you want to share something that you're feeling comfortable about, about

758
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,680
 the secrecy, the cover-up, please feel free to do so.

759
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,720
 But if you don't feel comfortable about doing that, fine, I understand.

760
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,960
 All I can say, sir, is I believe we're going to continue with our quest.

761
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:53,000
 We believe we will expose more things as we go along, things that we can verify as factual.

762
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,600
 And we promise you anything that we come up with will be made available to you to help

763
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,600
 us.

764
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
 Great.

765
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,600
 Okay.

766
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,600
 Thank you very much.

767
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,600
 Thank you, Senator.

768
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,600
 You're very welcome.

769
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
 Congressman Cook has just asked for a brief moment.

770
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,600
 Let me give him a minute, please.

771
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:11,420
 I would just like 30 seconds, I appreciate the chair's indulgence, to whether senators

772
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:17,760
 I respect more than any, I was a fan of him when I was in college, of Senator Gravel here.

773
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,760
 He's a wonderful man.

774
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,120
 But I would take on what he said.

775
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:26,000
 I think there is some danger to you in going beyond what might be protected from a member,

776
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,320
 you know, from our standpoint as former members of Congress or even as members of Congress,

777
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,720
 you may not have those same protections.

778
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,880
 So I advise you to listen to Mr. Frasconga on these kinds of questions rather than any

779
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,240
 one of us who are not experts on this.

780
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,700
 But you don't, I mean, you guys still have oaths of office.

781
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,700
 We understand that.

782
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,700
 And oaths of...

783
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,700
 Points well taken.

784
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,700
 Well taken.

785
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,700
 Thank you very much.

786
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,700
 Congresswoman.

787
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,700
 Yes.

788
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,000
 Thank you, Madam Chair.

789
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,440
 Very quickly, how many people...I mean, when I first heard you speak about this object

790
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:10,280
 that lit up the sky and that you observed and touched, how many people knew about that?

791
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,680
 I mean, was that reported in the press?

792
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:23,360
 I mean, you're near a base, was there a lot of members at your base that knew about this?

793
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,740
 There was quite a few people at the base that knew about it, the people that had the need

794
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,740
 to know.

795
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,800
 There's other people that have seen stuff in the sky.

796
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,800
 Right.

797
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,880
 I mean, there had to be some...if it came from the sky, somebody had to see it.

798
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,480
 There's a civilian, and he's been on the record.

799
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,800
 His name is Jerry Harris.

800
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,800
 Okay.

801
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,600
 He lived just off base.

802
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,600
 And you know, of course, I got to talk to him a number of years later.

803
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,480
 And he says, "Well, you know, I noticed stuff was going on."

804
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,840
 He says, "I seen, you know, this light over the...canopy of light over the forest."

805
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,840
 He says, "Then I see all this activity."

806
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,160
 I think they were talking about the third night with John, I'm not sure.

807
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,760
 And he says, "It was all unusual stuff," he says.

808
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,440
 So there was concern.

809
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:15,800
 And then he also worked...I guess he had a car shop, he worked on automotive stuff.

810
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,480
 And people from the base used that.

811
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:24,280
 And of course, the Scuttlebutt, which was running amok, about some kind of UFO, and

812
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:34,160
 that was actually the cover story, has been seen, and they just started to put more of

813
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,040
 those stories out.

814
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:43,360
 And I think that's what deflated the situation with the civilian population, because we were

815
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:54,480
 close with our British neighbors, or I mean, that they would not...you know, they heard

816
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,400
 things like, "We visited pubs, we went to the local economy, we did all that stuff."

817
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:05,160
 So there was chatter going on, I'm sure, and you know, unfortunately, what the chatter

818
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,640
 they were hearing was not true.

819
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,960
 It was a cover.

820
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:16,960
 And one of the interesting part about it, and it came out in Sky, whatever book that

821
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,360
 was, Sky something, Skycrash, yeah.

822
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:27,400
 There was three British investigators that was investigating it, initially in '83.

823
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:33,120
 And one of the things they talk about, and first of all, is what happened, and it's the

824
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,120
 cover story.

825
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,960
 They don't even know they're talking about the cover story, it's hilarious.

826
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,240
 But we did, it was good containment, I mean, it was working well.

827
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,920
 Then in '83, the news of the world, I had a disgruntled airman, apparently, talk to

828
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,120
 him, and they put that story out.

829
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:57,520
 And that was the cover story, I mean, it wasn't the right story, so it worked, it worked well.

830
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:04,160
 And then the other thing is, I got asked downtown about, "Hey, tell us about that situation

831
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,160
 out the base."

832
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,800
 What situation out the base?

833
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,480
 Now, you know, I'm really good at evasive stuff, I said, "What, the PLL trucks, or what,

834
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,480
 or the plane that came in, or what are you talking about?"

835
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,000
 "No, no, no, no, about that, your wing commander talking to the UFO people, that's the stuff

836
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,640
 they would say, I mean, it's all cover."

837
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,980
 So we had that kind of chatter, and after a while, you know, it's just, it's a laughable

838
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,800
 situation for people.

839
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:35,640
 But you were, were you the only two that actually saw it and touched it?

840
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,160
 No, ma'am.

841
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:44,400
 That was, well, we had the full security flight working that night, and we had the full law

842
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,400
 enforcement.

843
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,600
 And the difference between security and law enforcement, security protects the priority

844
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:54,320
 A, B, and C resources of the base, the operational, war-making stuff.

845
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:00,200
 Law enforcement, well, they're like the police for the base, you know, they do domestics

846
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,360
 and things like that.

847
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:08,000
 And there were 60, approximately about 60 of them, it could have been 80 on some nights,

848
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,800
 we were transitioning earlier from the F-4s there to the A-10s, so there was still some

849
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,440
 overages in people, so.

850
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:25,560
 But totally, on both the two nights, I would say it's more like 160 people, trained observers,

851
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,680
 security force members.

852
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,240
 They didn't all keep quiet about this, surely?

853
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,280
 The ones that were directly involved, yes.

854
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,280
 Okay.

855
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:42,640
 Those are the, that's how it works, ma'am, orders, and you follow orders, I mean, there

856
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,560
 was ongoing investigation, it was classified.

857
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,960
 You can't talk, oh, we don't have the privilege of Congress, we, we can't talk about things

858
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,960
 like that.

859
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,960
 It's criminal activity.

860
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,960
 They don't use the privilege.

861
00:57:53,960 --> 00:58:00,000
 Sometimes they don't use the privilege, you're right.

862
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:09,520
 So how many other people, are there any other people in your situation that were there,

863
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,060
 I mean, that may have touched it, or?

864
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:18,280
 There are, not touching it, like I said, I got the distinct.

865
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,000
 Or being close by, or?

866
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,360
 Close by, I mean, you're talking within 100 to 200 feet, that was the East Gate area,

867
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,600
 we had a restricted area that was down there that housed A-10s, they were parked in hardened

868
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:37,480
 structures down there, and we had security response teams that were patrolling those

869
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:45,600
 areas, alarm response teams, entry controllers, we had those kind of people that were working,

870
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:55,280
 and what happened is the control center put a order across the net saying everybody just

871
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,960
 stop transmissions and let us talk and do what we were doing out there, that was the

872
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,800
 security situation.

873
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:08,800
 And everybody got to listen, everybody unfortunately probably watched, I mean, they should be doing

874
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,800
 their job.

875
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,220
 At that time you should heighten your security a little bit more, you know, if there's something

876
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:18,720
 going off the base, don't, you know, start collecting in an area, but those are some

877
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,120
 mistakes that were probably made, some vulnerabilities that we did that probably shouldn't be known

878
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:29,680
 either, but they happened and it was 30 something years ago, it doesn't matter now, yeah, there's

879
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,080
 probably some things that were not correctly done, but it was out of curiosity, people

880
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,080
 were doing that.

881
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,640
 Right, I mean, why wouldn't you be curious about what had happened?

882
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:46,080
 So is there anybody else that's in the same situation you are, would any of these people

883
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:52,320
 that sort of knew about it because they were close by, would they cover up, would they

884
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,320
 be part of the cover-up?

885
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,320
 What are you doing?

886
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,320
 Can I ask you?

887
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,320
 Yeah, go ahead.

888
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:04,400
 Okay, ma'am, what's interesting is the fact that of the three nights, only five statements

889
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,880
 have surfaced from what went on.

890
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,520
 The first night there were three of us in one out there, the second night you had the

891
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,240
 shift commander and the on-duty flight chief, on the third night Colonel Hall took a team

892
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:20,560
 out there and there was also other personnel in the woods and different people saw different

893
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:26,280
 things, so that's one of the reasons why we come forward besides our health issues is

894
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:32,060
 I feel it's necessary that anyone that was even out in that area should have the opportunity

895
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:37,020
 to be checked out medically and be told what they were exposed to, especially something

896
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,080
 that's over 30 years old.

897
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,000
 That's one of the questions he asked me first up, he goes, what the heck was going on out

898
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,240
 there that would draw this much attention from the agencies involved to this day?

899
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,620
 What would still be classified and if it is, what did we have or what were we dealing with

900
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,160
 that would still remain silent today?

901
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,240
 Almost every weapon we've ever developed back in that time frame has been exposed that we're

902
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:05,680
 aware of and yet today this is still classified and we can't even receive medical treatment

903
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,680
 for it.

904
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,280
 Should we tell them about what happened with OSI?

905
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:16,440
 Oh, yes, one other thing that happened that when we sent our FOIA request, OSI blew their

906
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:24,120
 time limit and after we made certain announcements, yes, they blew it by ear, but our attorney

907
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:29,400
 can go into detail the contact we had in a make-up form they asked us to sign implying

908
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,120
 that we could be perjuring ourselves.

909
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,720
 So they're trying to throw intimidation 32 years later?

910
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,720
 They're trying to intimidate you.

911
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,720
 Are you kidding me?

912
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,720
 I mean, you think we--

913
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,360
 I can see that you've been intimidated.

914
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,560
 Yeah, we're intimidated.

915
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,560
 We laughed about it.

916
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,960
 Is that the best they got?

917
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:52,200
 Is that the best they can do after 32 years, is try the intimidation-- it had a made-up

918
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,200
 form, ma'am.

919
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,200
 I mean, come on.

920
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,200
 You think we're idiots?

921
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:01,040
 You know, that was a made-up form and then you had contact, too, also our attorney, which

922
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:05,400
 shook him up a little bit, I think, because he wasn't-- were you okay with that?

923
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:13,560
 I've had the NSA call me on my cell phone just to see how I was doing and so, now, remember

924
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,440
 I used the word "weird" earlier.

925
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,440
 Yes.

926
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,000
 This is another example of, you know--

927
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,120
 So why the interest 32 years later if nothing happened?

928
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:28,920
 And why did they blow what's under the law, the FOIA requests?

929
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,400
 They refused to answer our second-- what we submitted, which was a little different than

930
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,560
 the first time, but the excuse they used was they'd already answered the first FOIA request,

931
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,120
 so they're not going to answer the second FOIA request.

932
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,000
 What are they hiding until this day?

933
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,920
 You know, those dogs don't hunt.

934
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,920
 They don't.

935
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,400
 They're telling us stuff like they think we're airmen.

936
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,560
 I mean, like, just two years, five years in, oh, no, no, we're grown men.

937
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,400
 That stuff, I think, is not going to work with us.

938
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,760
 And you think we're going to-- I'll make the record clear, we're not going to sit back

939
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,160
 and take anything from the United States government right now at this point.

940
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,560
 I mean, we're here to go ahead and clear this up the best we can and to get answers.

941
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:15,280
 This is a step in the process, and this is not over.

942
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,800
 This is not over for John and I.

943
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,920
 I mean, we're going to continue to do that.

944
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,040
 Once we achieve what we want to achieve, we're going to go off radar.

945
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,480
 You'll never hear from us again.

946
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,680
 Never hear from us again.

947
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,760
 We'll be off radar.

948
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,560
 And that's what we want to have happen.

949
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,920
 That's all we ever wanted to have happen.

950
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,360
 We wanted it to go away.

951
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:38,360
 You want those questions answered, which you deserve.

952
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,080
 Yes, and I think if the-- if we didn't have the caveats--

953
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,400
 Excuse me, just one moment for the record, will you-- Congresswoman, two more minutes,

954
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,400
 please.

955
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:54,400
 If we didn't have the caveats that were laid on our command structure at the time, and

956
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:00,800
 also the classified documents that-- and programs that were going on, which have been classified

957
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,880
 now, we will talk about them later.

958
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:16,120
 I don't think that-- I think here's-- let me go and change my thought on this.

959
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:26,520
 If you look at the-- take a look at the Bentwaters incident, the Reynolds and Forest incident,

960
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:37,120
 not as a UFO incident, but as an incident that is going to cause, apparently, the DLD

961
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:44,640
 and other federal agencies grief if any of that information got out.

962
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,160
 Why is there so much grief involved for them?

963
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,400
 Why is there something so classified that it can't get out?

964
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,320
 Well, I think it's because-- and I'm going to go ahead and say this is my thoughts on

965
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,320
 it.

966
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:03,440
 I think it's because of the lies that have been done for the last 85 years.

967
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,320
 I think they don't want the real truth to come out, not because they-- American people

968
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,800
 can't handle it, because they don't want to get caught with their pants down.

969
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,800
 That's the problem.

970
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,680
 They've been lying about UFOs.

971
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,920
 That's what's going on here.

972
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,160
 If you ask a question to the United States government, anybody, you say, "Tell me what

973
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,160
 you know about UFOs."

974
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,200
 Well, you know what, that's not the right question.

975
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:36,160
 What you've got to do is you've got to ask the right questions to whatever agency you're

976
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,160
 asking.

977
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,640
 You've got to be very specific of what you're asking.

978
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,640
 You know what I'm saying.

979
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,640
 "Tell me about UFOs."

980
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,640
 Oh, no.

981
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,640
 UFOs don't exist.

982
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,640
 UFOs, that's UFOs.

983
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,640
 They don't-- they don't give you any answers.

984
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,680
 >> I yield a half a minute.

985
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,680
 >> Oh, sorry.

986
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,120
 >> Let me help you on that one.

987
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,120
 >> Sure.

988
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:57,320
 >> When the issue is brought before the White House, the White House says there's nothing

989
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,320
 out there.

990
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,120
 You know, nothing's gone on.

991
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,600
 Nothing's being covered up.

992
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:06,440
 So in order to back up the White House, the whole chain of command within the government

993
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:13,840
 continues this mockery of not telling the truth, because this is the position of the

994
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,840
 White House.

995
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,600
 If the White House came out and said, "Oh, there is," then all bets would be off.

996
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,800
 So it starts there, and it ends down at you.

997
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,320
 >> I think it's bigger than that, though.

998
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,440
 I think it's-- I think presidents come and go.

999
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,440
 >> Yeah.

1000
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,440
 >> Okay?

1001
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
 >> Yes, they do.

1002
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,080
 >> I think you folks come and go.

1003
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,960
 I don't think-- I don't think these secrets are general knowledge to you folks, or what--

1004
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,320
 or to presidents, okay?

1005
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,280
 That's my thoughts on it.

1006
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,920
 An interesting conversation I'll share with you.

1007
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:51,480
 We were coming back from a Larry King show in 2007, and Governor Simonton was in there,

1008
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:58,000
 and he was, I guess, friends with President Clinton, or still is, or some kind of situation

1009
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,440
 with their friends.

1010
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:06,240
 So we got done with the show, and then the president had called Fife and was talking

1011
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:11,960
 to him, and of course he's on speaker, but he didn't know.

1012
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,160
 He brought the conversation about the two questions that he asked when he was president.

1013
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,320
 You know, like, who killed Kennedy, and are UFOs for real?

1014
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,320
 >> Yeah.

1015
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,320
 >> Yeah, he didn't know either.

1016
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,280
 He didn't have a need to know.

1017
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,280
 Apparently.

1018
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,280
 >> But they all--

1019
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,280
 >> All time has been yielded.

1020
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,280
 >> They all last time.

1021
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,280
 Yes.

1022
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,280
 >> Let me take this back.

1023
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,280
 >> Thank you.

1024
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,280
 >> Thank you very much.

1025
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,280
 Thank you very much.

1026
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,280
 You, too, sir.

1027
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,280
 Thank you very much.

1028
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,120
 One thing you said, Sergeant Pennington, in that last-- and the more you talk, the more

1029
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,400
 information we get by the way.

1030
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,760
 But you did say something, if you take UFOs out of it, that is the issue, UFOs out of

1031
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,760
 it.

1032
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,760
 Period.

1033
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,760
 That's it.

1034
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,760
 Next.

1035
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,760
 Congressman Cook.

1036
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:01,600
 >> I would follow the chair's admonition to focus my questions on the incident, with

1037
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,600
 one exception.

1038
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:12,840
 I'd like to turn back to the medical records, because I think in the context that you open

1039
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:21,280
 up maybe a small file, as far as most people would consider, you might be able to take

1040
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:27,960
 a truth embargo blockade and maybe move it at a break of the time, but that's where major

1041
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,800
 cracks start occurring and where things start falling into place.

1042
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:41,480
 Now, if this panel, for example, and I'm going to talk to each one to see if I could get

1043
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:49,680
 them to sign a letter that I'm going to be asking them to help compose to both the Veterans

1044
01:08:49,680 --> 01:09:00,280
 Administration and to the President of the United States, because we've had, wait till

1045
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:05,380
 you hear what's going to be in the letter, you may not be so enthused.

1046
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:10,960
 I figure you've had three very strong United States senators fighting with the Veterans

1047
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,960
 Administration.

1048
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:19,280
 I think it's time to ask President Obama himself in the letter, maybe we'll initially send

1049
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:25,120
 it to Veterans with a copy to him, and then we'll send it to the President, I hope, or

1050
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:30,200
 something, to ask for something very simple here, something that may not sound very dramatic

1051
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:37,200
 to anybody, and that's Sergeant Burroughs and Sergeant Paniston's medical records, because

1052
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:44,120
 I submit, if we see in those white gums, if we see in those heart problems at a young

1053
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:54,280
 age of a recent Air Force person that served in England, if we find some of the other,

1054
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:59,480
 and I can't remember, I wrote them all down, and I may have to talk to you again to get

1055
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:07,680
 this letter, but I submit that if we find those kinds of evidences, and what there's

1056
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:14,840
 no legal reason, I've even chatted with an attorney during the break to withhold a medical

1057
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:23,080
 record, and I'm sure your attorneys probably would confirm what my attorney just told me.

1058
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:29,240
 I think this could be the start of that brick taking down process at least, so we'll know.

1059
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:38,840
 Now getting back to the incident, Bentwaters and Woodbridge, and I'd like to first focus

1060
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,640
 this on Nick Pope.

1061
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:49,960
 Now they're in Suffolk County, excuse my lack of geography of your country, but Ipswich,

1062
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:50,960
 is that close?

1063
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,960
 Yes, it is.

1064
01:10:51,960 --> 01:11:00,040
 I just remember serving in Britain for my church, actually.

1065
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:06,120
 We would go up to there to get American hamburgers, because quite honestly, with all due respect,

1066
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:12,680
 the British wimpies just didn't meet our standards in those days, and the reason I'm asking that

1067
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:20,400
 is because even though those are two RAF, Royal Air Force bases, how many American servicemen

1068
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:27,120
 are surrounding those bases are on those bases, compared to how many British service people?

1069
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:34,680
 The bases are prefaced as Royal Air Force, but essentially, sir, that's in name only.

1070
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:41,520
 There is, I think, literally one or two British liaison officers.

1071
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,920
 I needed the clarification, so almost everybody there is an American serviceman?

1072
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,120
 Yes, sir.

1073
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:53,640
 Okay, now this can explain maybe General Gabriel coming in there and just taking charge and

1074
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,640
 upsetting the Minister of Defense at the time.

1075
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:01,200
 Again, yes, sir.

1076
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:05,120
 Because I'm going to ask Nick Pope this question directly.

1077
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:11,800
 If Gabriel hadn't been taking evidence the way it's outlined in your statement at the

1078
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:18,920
 time, and taking it back to what Rheinstein, Germany, or whatever it was, you said the

1079
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,960
 Minister of Defense was upset.

1080
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,040
 This was in the early stages of the Thatcher, the Iron Lady.

1081
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,560
 What did he do about it?

1082
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,960
 What did the British ... Because this is a significant thing, a Minister of Defense not

1083
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,080
 being happy with something the United States General just did.

1084
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:41,760
 We've heard this stuff about nuclear weaponry, and I think there might be something very

1085
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,160
 definitely to that, some kind of nuclear ... Well, the British have nukes, too.

1086
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,160
 It's not just the Americans.

1087
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,280
 But this must have been ... As you say, these were American-operated things, and I'm going

1088
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,520
 to try to hurry this up a bit.

1089
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,480
 But what can you tell me about that?

1090
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:02,480
 Because clearly there's already lots of evidence of radiation, of something strange that had

1091
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,040
 to be stopped immediately and covered up immediately.

1092
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:11,640
 Doesn't necessarily mean UFO, as Mr. Penniston has absolutely told us.

1093
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:19,680
 But give us just a little more detail, so that we can get a sense of why so quickly?

1094
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,240
 And I just take a minute, because I've got a lot ... I still have to get into the incident

1095
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,240
 itself.

1096
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,840
 I've only got a few minutes left.

1097
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,840
 Okay.

1098
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:31,800
 Firstly, I apologize if I have inadvertently misled anyone in this point.

1099
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:40,200
 I meant to say that the Ministry of Defense was corporately upset about this, not the

1100
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,600
 minister, personally.

1101
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:50,120
 But to just expand on that point, clearly America was always regarded by us in the Ministry

1102
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:53,960
 of Defense as the senior partner within NATO.

1103
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:59,000
 And there was, I think, the best way I can characterize a sort of unwritten "don't criticize

1104
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,200
 the Americans" rule.

1105
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:09,320
 And so while you'll see in some of those British documents a discernible frustration with the

1106
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:15,600
 way in which the Americans took over this investigation, that was never articulated

1107
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,640
 in a more fulsome manner.

1108
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,640
 Okay.

1109
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:28,320
 Anyway, there is a very strong suspicion of nuclear weaponry information exchange or something

1110
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,200
 going on here.

1111
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,360
 But we don't know.

1112
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:39,640
 The question I have for Sergeant Peniston here, these two submittals to us today, my

1113
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,200
 understanding is you drew this.

1114
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,080
 Yes, sir.

1115
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:50,880
 When was this first given after ... When did you draw this, first of all?

1116
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,360
 I believe it was the 27th, 28th, 29th of December.

1117
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,880
 So right within a day or two of the first?

1118
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,880
 Yes.

1119
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,880
 Yes.

1120
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,880
 Okay.

1121
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:02,880
 And what about this?

1122
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,360
 That was drawn last year.

1123
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:09,040
 The one in my notebook is too squiggly.

1124
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:15,600
 I'm right in their free hand and I was nervous.

1125
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,040
 And so I cleaned it up to show exactly what it looked like.

1126
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,960
 And that's what it looked like, except ... But this is in the notebook that you did not throw

1127
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,960
 away, am I right?

1128
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:24,960
 No.

1129
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,640
 This book is ... I still have it.

1130
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,320
 And you have to verify that.

1131
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:37,520
 The circular object at the bottom of it is actually on the top on the notes I have, and

1132
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,600
 that's where it was on the craft, so ... Okay.

1133
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,880
 This is what I wanted to ask you next, but you answered it.

1134
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:48,320
 This was what you believe, and in the original notebook, this came from, was written, was

1135
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,480
 done at the same central time?

1136
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,480
 Right.

1137
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,680
 You say December, December of '80.

1138
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:59,880
 The notebook was written in the real time, sir, at the time.

1139
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,560
 Okay.

1140
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,720
 And you say this was on the craft?

1141
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:10,200
 That's my observations and part of my report, yes.

1142
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:18,080
 So when did anybody that's superior to you in the Air Force or anybody in the United

1143
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:22,760
 States government at all see these, initially?

1144
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,320
 When did you first submit these?

1145
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:30,080
 The drawing, the rough drawing of the craft was done for OSI.

1146
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,480
 It says right on there, OSI.

1147
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,480
 Oh, okay.

1148
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,880
 Yeah, but I can't read it too well.

1149
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,880
 That's a small print.

1150
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,200
 Well, I was 20 ... I can't read whether it was '29 or '21, but that's ... Okay.

1151
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:46,280
 So it was in December, and I take it this was not submitted at that time?

1152
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,280
 No.

1153
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,280
 Unless you submitted the notebook.

1154
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:54,800
 The glyphs were not ... That was strange because in the interview I wrote down, I said there

1155
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,040
 was glyphs, I said you wanted to see what the glyphs looked like, they didn't care about

1156
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,040
 it.

1157
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,040
 They knew.

1158
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,040
 They knew.

1159
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,040
 That's what I thought.

1160
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,040
 Okay.

1161
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,040
 Let's see.

1162
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,040
 I have another minute.

1163
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,040
 Okay.

1164
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:10,720
 Well, let me ask you then.

1165
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:16,120
 Who do you recall or what title of the person that you submitted this to and what were their

1166
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,120
 reactions?

1167
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,920
 OSI does not wear uniforms.

1168
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,960
 Their ranks are restricted.

1169
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,320
 But like I said, they had to be from another base or they either probably had to be State

1170
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,320
 Department.

1171
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,200
 The odd part ... When you said they had to be, was there a requirement or is that what

1172
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,200
 your perception is?

1173
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,200
 No.

1174
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:39,120
 At that ... OSI doesn't work for the Wing Commander or Air Force or anything like that over there.

1175
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,120
 Yeah.

1176
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:45,920
 In the overseas capacity in England, they work for the State Department in London, working

1177
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,920
 out in London.

1178
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,080
 That's who they're ... So this is why you're saying the State Department knew full well

1179
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:57,080
 what you were saying within days of when you said it or when you first described it to

1180
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,080
 your own ... Right.

1181
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:05,440
 And also with Mr. Pope, there's backup on how fast the MOD started investigating it

1182
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,440
 too.

1183
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,420
 That with other people coming out there ... I mean, in a matter of days, there's people

1184
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,160
 out there investigating it.

1185
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,480
 And if Mr. Pope could just quickly add anything there on that.

1186
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:24,720
 My understanding is that certain people came out to check potential nuclear, chemical,

1187
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,480
 biological, or radiological hazard.

1188
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,480
 One moment, please.

1189
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,200
 The other gentleman, two extra minutes.

1190
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,200
 Thank you very much.

1191
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,900
 Go ahead.

1192
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:36,200
 That was really all I wanted to say on that point, sir.

1193
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:42,880
 My understanding, again, as I say, is that it was the potential hazard that was of interest

1194
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:48,080
 and really the potential NBC hazard.

1195
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:55,840
 And Sergeant Burroughs, I wanted to ask you, were you aware at the time that Sergeant Penniston

1196
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,440
 was sending this to the OSI folks or not?

1197
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,440
 No, sir.

1198
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,440
 You weren't.

1199
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,640
 When did you learn about Sergeant Penniston's submittals?

1200
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,760
 I can't give you the exact date.

1201
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,760
 Approximately?

1202
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,040
 It was in the early '90s when Colonel Hall released the three statements.

1203
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,760
 And there was more information coming out.

1204
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:23,200
 That is one of our questions, number one, why the memo was ever released; number two,

1205
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,860
 why the tape was ever released; and number three, why our statements were released.

1206
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:30,840
 All that was done after we were told it was going to remain classified and we didn't have

1207
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,600
 to worry about it any longer.

1208
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:39,360
 And give me, again, a sense of the dates on those real quickly here, of when those different

1209
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,360
 releases occurred.

1210
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:45,080
 Memo came out, I believe, in '83, right, Nick, when News of the World took it?

1211
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,080
 Yes.

1212
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:52,200
 In 1983, the memo through Freedom of Information Act was released to the general public shortly

1213
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,360
 after the tape was released and put all over the air.

1214
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:02,760
 And last but not least, our statements were released in the early '90s by Colonel Hall.

1215
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:08,920
 And one thing I'd like to add, this is my take personally from talking to the Colonel.

1216
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,100
 I believe he wants to talk more, but because it's still classified, I believe he feels

1217
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,600
 -- and he's gone on the record saying that he'd be willing to talk about what he knew

1218
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,600
 if the members of Congress would bring him in, swear him in, and he would have the protection

1219
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,160
 given to him to talk about what is classified and what's going on.

1220
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,160
 Okay.

1221
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,160
 Let me make sure I understand.

1222
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,960
 Is this the same Colonel that worked for Gabriel at the time?

1223
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:30,960
 No.

1224
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:31,960
 Colonel Hall was the deputy base commander.

1225
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:32,960
 Oh, okay.

1226
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,960
 Their names are similar.

1227
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,960
 Right.

1228
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,520
 Colonel Hall, I believe, would come forward and he's made statements to the fact that

1229
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,520
 he would be willing to testify everything he knew in front of Congress.

1230
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,520
 Okay.

1231
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:47,000
 Well, let me just ask you then if Nick, you know, or if Sergeant Penniston, you know,

1232
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:58,080
 or anybody else that might know, within a day or two of the December 26th -- or first

1233
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:06,600
 sighting, let's say, the memo clearly showed some indents in the part of the forest where

1234
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:11,600
 you described the craft as being.

1235
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,080
 Am I right about that?

1236
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,080
 That's correct.

1237
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,400
 There's no question about --

1238
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,400
 There's no question.

1239
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,400
 None.

1240
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:27,560
 And he wrote that memo, the Colonel that was assigned to General Gabriel that did get released

1241
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:34,400
 from -- that was the one letter or the one memo we have was -- I'm just trying to make

1242
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,400
 sure I got this right.

1243
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,400
 I'm not sure where he's going with this.

1244
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,400
 I'm not --

1245
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,400
 Colonel Hall --

1246
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,400
 I'm not going anywhere.

1247
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,400
 I'm just trying to gather data.

1248
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,400
 Colonel Hall --

1249
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,400
 Excuse me, just one moment.

1250
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,400
 The general in time has expired.

1251
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,400
 Would you like another minute?

1252
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,400
 Just one minute.

1253
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,400
 Just one last minute.

1254
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,400
 Okay.

1255
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,400
 And I apologize for --

1256
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,400
 That's okay.

1257
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,400
 I'll try to explain the chain of command.

1258
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,400
 Yeah, please.

1259
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,400
 General Gabriel was in charge of the entire U-Safie area.

1260
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,400
 Right.

1261
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,400
 Okay.

1262
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,400
 General Basely was the third Air Force commander.

1263
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,400
 Okay.

1264
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:02,080
 Colonel Hall would have worked for Colonel Conrad and General Williams.

1265
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,080
 So he wrote the memo --

1266
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,080
 Okay.

1267
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,080
 Right.

1268
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:10,480
 And what he did was he was told to, after General Williams took the tape to General

1269
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:15,960
 Basely, and they came back -- this was the exact words of Colonel Hall -- the staff got

1270
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:20,160
 together, reviewed the tape, and they said, "We don't want to touch this.

1271
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,960
 This is a British problem.

1272
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:22,960
 Come back."

1273
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:23,960
 Okay.

1274
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,760
 General Williams came back to Colonel Hall and said, "Go ahead and write up a brief memo

1275
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,880
 and brief the British on what happened."

1276
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,880
 Okay.

1277
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,400
 But that memo definitely talks about those indentations.

1278
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:39,400
 It definitely talks about a much higher than normal radiation level that he checked out

1279
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,400
 a day later.

1280
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:44,160
 That's what I needed to understand.

1281
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,160
 Thank you.

1282
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,160
 I yield back.

1283
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,160
 Thank you very much.

1284
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,160
 Thank you.

1285
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:49,160
 No, no.

1286
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,160
 Thank you very much.

1287
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,160
 But Carlson Bartlett would like to ask an additional question.

1288
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:55,260
 I believe the year was 1957.

1289
01:22:55,260 --> 01:23:00,080
 I was at an American Physiological Society meeting.

1290
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,640
 I had just come off of four years of teaching medical school.

1291
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:08,880
 I was now a very young Ph.D. and a very serious basic researcher working at the National Institutes

1292
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,440
 of Health.

1293
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:17,680
 I was going to deliver a paper -- I did deliver the paper -- on physiological effects of coitus

1294
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,800
 in humans.

1295
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:26,840
 This was just after Alfred Kinsey had published his first book, so you can get some idea of

1296
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,600
 the environment at that time.

1297
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:36,760
 There was some serious concern that I would be punished for this by NIH, that there would

1298
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,640
 be repercussions for giving this paper.

1299
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,720
 This was not the kind of thing you did at that time.

1300
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:45,360
 I thought that medically it would be nice to know whether medical activity would be

1301
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,160
 hazardous to your health or not.

1302
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,360
 So we published that paper.

1303
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,820
 One of the members of the press came up to me and said, "You don't need to worry about

1304
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:59,480
 repercussions from this because there would be all hell to pay in the press if in fact

1305
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:05,200
 there were repercussions because you are giving this paper today."

1306
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:11,000
 Relative to the question that Senator Gravel asked you, it really disturbs me that there

1307
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,880
 would be a suggestion -- by the way, I think that it is inconceivable that the whole truth

1308
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:22,400
 -- and you swore an oath that you were going to tell us the truth and the whole truth -- it's

1309
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:28,640
 inconceivable to me that the whole truth could have any impact on our national security.

1310
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:32,600
 I have some real concerns about our civil liberties and the future is why I carry a

1311
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,600
 copy of the Constitution.

1312
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,680
 I have no idea if there is anything in your breast that you need to clear, but if there

1313
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:44,400
 is, I just think that there are enough people watching this, there is enough press out there

1314
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,040
 with all of their liabilities.

1315
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:49,960
 I think that the press will not stand by if there are any repercussions from this.

1316
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:55,520
 I just wanted to get this -- I have a huge concern about our civil liberties and our

1317
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:03,760
 security for the future and I just don't want to be a part of any effort to restrain your

1318
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,640
 freedom to tell us anything and everything that you think might be important here.

1319
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,640
 Thank you, Madam Chair.

1320
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,640
 Thank you.

1321
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,640
 Thank you very much.

1322
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,640
 Councilwoman Wolsey?

1323
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:23,080
 Well, I just have a very quick question and to each of you up there, what is -- and this

1324
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:30,480
 is opinion I'm asking -- what is your opinion on the containment or the cover-up?

1325
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:42,320
 Is it because of the nuclear issue or connection between the base and nuclear?

1326
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,840
 Or is it because of UFOs?

1327
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,600
 Or do you just -- you don't have to answer, but I'd like your opinion.

1328
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,600
 You're in it.

1329
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,800
 I'd like to go first.

1330
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,560
 As I said earlier, we're doing an ongoing investigation and what's become apparent to

1331
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:07,520
 us is that whatever we're dealing with -- and it's been labeled UFO, ET, alien -- one of

1332
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,000
 the first things you'll see in an incident, including where I lived in Arizona, the Phoenix

1333
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,200
 Light, is they bring up the alien stuff.

1334
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:19,280
 And that automatically almost immediately makes a lot of people shy away from it based

1335
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,560
 on the cover-up that I believe started with the War of the Worlds when they started conditioning

1336
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:30,080
 people that aliens and stuff are not a smart thing to talk about or be involved with.

1337
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:36,440
 But I believe honestly -- and I believe eventually we're going to be able to show this -- that

1338
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,360
 why our government is holding what they are and other governments are.

1339
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:45,360
 It's got nothing to do with secrecy from the American public or the other countries.

1340
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,120
 It's about power.

1341
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:53,160
 If you look at what the capabilities that we saw out there that night are, would you

1342
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,040
 not believe that there would be a race by every government of the world to try to take

1343
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:01,760
 that technology and use it for one thing, which we're all good at in this world, is

1344
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:06,680
 war-making capabilities and to control people and countries.

1345
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:12,400
 And I believe in my heart that it will be eventually exposed that it is somewhat of

1346
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:18,320
 national defense, but ultimately as a society and a world, we need to get away from that.

1347
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,980
 But that's what's going on with this.

1348
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:24,640
 It's being covered up because everybody is in a race to try to take this technology and

1349
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,640
 use it against each other.

1350
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,640
 Thank you.

1351
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,640
 (Applause.)

1352
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:35,600
 Okay, the committee will stand adjourned until after lunch at 1.45.

1353
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,600
 Thank you.

1354
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:36,600
 Thank you.
