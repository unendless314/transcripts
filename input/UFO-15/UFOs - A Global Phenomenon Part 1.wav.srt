1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,980
 So if you're prepared to affirm that, would you please stand?

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,380
 And we'll wait for Antonio, just for the cameras.

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,320
 And if you could raise your hand, I'd appreciate that too.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,660
 You're welcome to repeat this in your native language as well.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,460
 I do hereby affirm.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,800
 >> I do hereby affirm.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,320
 >> That I will tell the truth.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,760
 >> That I will tell the truth.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,160
 >> And nothing but the truth.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,860
 >> And nothing but the truth.

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,340
 >> To this committee today.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,540
 >> To this committee today.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,040
 >> Thank you.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,180
 >> Thank you.

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,740
 I'd like to welcome this panel.

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,520
 Thank you very much for coming this morning.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,680
 We had people from South America.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,680
 I'm looking forward to now hearing from people from around the world

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,260
 and appreciate you taking your time to be here today.

20
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,920
 What I would like you to do is give your opening statements

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,100
 and I think we'll have everyone on the panel do that.

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,960
 And then we'll go back to the people at this podium

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,700
 and they will ask questions after you get

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,240
 through with your opening statements.

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,340
 So would you like to start first?

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,440
 Thank you.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,720
 >> I am Dr. Roberto Pinotti, a sociologist,

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,280
 a retired aerospace journalist, and an ufologist as well.

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,160
 I was born in 1944 in Venice and I live in Florence, Italy.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,360
 As a political science university student in 1967,

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,960
 I founded Centro Fologico Nazionale,

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,240
 which is the most authoritative scientific ufo research team

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,140
 and one of the world's five oldest civilian ufo

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,740
 organizations still active in touch with Aeronautica Militare,

35
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,020
 the Italian Air Force.

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:04,660
 Since 1947, Italy experienced more than 12,000 ufo events

37
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:14,040
 and four major ufo waves in 1950, 1954, 1973, and 1978.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,240
 And Aeronautica Militare Italiana faced them seriously.

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,500
 In the '60s and '70s, I also developed discrete

40
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,680
 but important personal contacts with Soviet ufologists

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,580
 and I visited them in Moscow in 1974.

42
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,320
 In 1978, Joseph Allen Hynek, the former consultant

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,360
 for the United States Air Force Project Blue Book,

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,520
 asked me to represent his Center for Ufo Studies in Italy.

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,000
 I was already an Italian correspondent

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,640
 for NYCAP, APRO, and MUFON.

47
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,740
 During the Cold War in 1971 and 1972,

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,140
 I had been an officer in the Italian Hermes Netto Third

49
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,780
 Myself Brigade.

50
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,180
 And as such, I had been ordered to prepare an official ufo

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,880
 presentation for the staff of my unit, the text of which

52
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,120
 was later published in the Italian Army Magazine.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,300
 Back to civilian life after my marriage,

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,900
 I had been also asked to cooperate as a consultant

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,540
 on UFOs by Italian Army intelligence officer Colonel

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,400
 Michelangelo Privitera in Florence.

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,140
 In 1978, I and Kuhn began to interact also

58
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,480
 with the Italian Air Force in Rome

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,220
 due to the amazing Italian UFO wave of that year

60
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,860
 with over 2,000 UFO sightings report.

61
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,600
 Among so many reliable UFO experiences--

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,160
 pilots, flight controllers, military personnel, journalists,

63
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,040
 and scientists, as well as common people--

64
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,240
 in 1978, I directly witnessed for three hours,

65
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,940
 and also photographed near Perugia,

66
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,840
 some as darling-like UFO phenomena interacting

67
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,540
 with our group of 11 witnesses.

68
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,780
 Since then, and as a result of this wave

69
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,320
 and of a parliamentary question mentioning me and CUN,

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,260
 our center, the Italian Air Force Reparto Generale

71
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,000
 Sicurezza, was charged by our government's premier, Giulio

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,500
 Andreotti, to monitor UFO phenomena in Italy regularly.

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,040
 Then in 1980, I was invited by the House of Lords in London

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,080
 to lecture for them about the Italian 1978 UFO wave.

75
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,380
 Later, the Italian Air Force Magazine

76
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,180
 published the text of my London speech

77
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,860
 and asked me to write articles about UFOs

78
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,660
 for this official publication regularly.

79
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,720
 In 1981, I also started to cooperate

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,500
 with the French government's UFO State Commission, Japan,

81
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,600
 in Toulouse.

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,440
 Between 1985 and 1995, I was involved as a sociologist

83
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,440
 in an Italian aerospace firm working on space architecture

84
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,140
 and habitability projects with the University of Florence

85
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,180
 for Alenia Spazio, the Italian Space Agency

86
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,160
 and the European Space Agency.

87
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,760
 And I presented several scientific papers

88
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,120
 in different aerospace congresses.

89
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,320
 In particular, a couple of my papers

90
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,760
 were highly appreciated by the SETI scientists

91
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,140
 during the International Astronautical Federation

92
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,080
 Congresses in 1988 and 1999.

93
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,680
 I also investigated directly the Roswell and Philip Corso

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,520
 cases in the United States and also

95
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,220
 the case for ancient India's Vimana air vehicles in Pakistan.

96
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,260
 In 1993, I started with the government

97
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,060
 of the Republic of San Marino an annual double world symposium

98
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,360
 about SETI and UFO research, destined

99
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,000
 to be the most important event of this kind in Europe

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,640
 during the last 21 years.

101
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,100
 Besides, in 1994, we translated, released, and published

102
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,680
 the KGB UFO dossier we received from our Russian colleagues

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,120
 and were officially thanked by our government.

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,160
 Since 1995, our international UFO magazine started in 1966,

105
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,860
 began to be distributed and sold in Italian newsstands.

106
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,260
 And in 1997, a 1,600 page multimedia UFO

107
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,340
 encyclopedia edited by me was published in Italy and Spain.

108
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,840
 Since 1973, I wrote and published 35 books

109
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,180
 about UFOs and related subjects, also published abroad.

110
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,760
 In 2012, The Nature of the UFO Problem

111
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,200
 was even presented in a popular comic book with me

112
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,960
 as the principal character.

113
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,700
 Apart from this, in 2000, the Italian Air Force

114
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,320
 sent an official delegation in their uniforms

115
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,600
 headed by the Reparto Generale Sicurezza's chief, General Aldo

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,800
 Oliveiro, to present their UFO data during the San Marino

117
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
 symposium.

118
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,720
 Later, I was allowed in different occasions

119
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,080
 to consult their files in Rome.

120
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,400
 That is, about 400 military UFO dossier in 40 years.

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,160
 In my books, I publish the synthesis

122
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,760
 of most of these files, ranging from rather visual sightings

123
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,960
 and intercepting actions by pilots to photographic evidence

124
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,560
 and from physical traces cases to UFO landings

125
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,760
 and close encounters with their occupants.

126
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,680
 Nevertheless, not all cases may be

127
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,240
 found in these archives, such as the event

128
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,160
 occurred in the president of Italy's private estate

129
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,440
 at Castelga-Porziano on August the 20th, 1963,

130
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,240
 and some other ghost cases.

131
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,640
 As a good friend of the late Roman Catholic theologian

132
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,600
 Monsignor Corrado Balducci, who wrote the preface to one

133
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,800
 of my books, I am well-informed about the Vatican UFO and ET

134
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,760
 attitudes.

135
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,280
 And I also lectured about all this inside the Vatican city,

136
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,720
 also recently, on the 24th of April of this year.

137
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,200
 In 2000, we exposed in San Marino

138
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,720
 important historical documents verified by forensic analysis

139
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,120
 written in 1936 about Italian UFO reports in the '30s,

140
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,720
 showing that the first government who

141
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,800
 faced the UFO problem in the world

142
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,680
 was really the Italian government in 1933

143
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,640
 with a secret scientific team created by Mussolini

144
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,160
 and headed by Guglielmo Marconi to study

145
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,480
 unconventional flying vehicles as possible new enemy weapons

146
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,040
 from another country in Europe.

147
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,120
 Besides, recent historical studies

148
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,880
 confirm the visual evidence of the presence of UFOs

149
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,960
 also in Italian Renaissance paintings.

150
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,520
 In my opinion, the intelligent nature of UFO phenomena

151
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,880
 is evident, and the extraterrestrial hypothesis

152
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,400
 in ufology is today stronger and stronger.

153
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,000
 To conclude, this year, after the second official philatelic

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,400
 issue of a San Marino stamp about UFOs,

155
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,960
 delegates from 10 different countries--

156
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,000
 Italy, France, USA, Switzerland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania,

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,880
 Spain, Norway, and Cuba--

158
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,240
 proposed to create an international UFO documentation

159
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,800
 center in San Marino and presented during the symposium

160
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,280
 a common and definite scientific proposal

161
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,920
 for future and needed extraterrestrial contact

162
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,040
 protocols.

163
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,800
 This will be a good basis for a necessary approach

164
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,560
 to exodiplomacy, the future scenario for human civilization.

165
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
 Thank you.

166
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,760
 Thank you.

167
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,680
 [APPLAUSE]

168
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,880
 I think we're just going to go down the road--

169
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,640
 down the road, and then we will come back and ask questions.

170
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,600
 Dr. Schille?

171
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,000
 Welcome.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,500
 Thank you.

173
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:49,880
 Congresswomen, congressmen, ladies and gentlemen,

174
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,600
 good afternoon.

175
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,160
 My name is Sun Shili.

176
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,600
 I am from the People's Republic of China.

177
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,960
 I am the president of the World Chinese UFO Federation.

178
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,400
 Our federation serves as a communication platform

179
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,480
 for the global Chinese on all aspects of UFO,

180
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,840
 including those in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan,

181
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,560
 and abroad.

182
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,760
 We have 1.3 billion people in China.

183
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,560
 And on top of that, we also have a lot of overseas Chinese.

184
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,360
 That means we have a very big federation.

185
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,080
 I also wanted to point out that Chinese people consider

186
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,440
 ourselves as the descendants of dragon.

187
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,600
 And dragon is from out of space in the Chinese culture.

188
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,680
 So in the Chinese culture, we are from out of space

189
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,560
 as descendants of dragon.

190
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,000
 Secondly, we call our land as the land of deities,

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,360
 or the land of gods.

192
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,840
 And another principle in the Chinese culture,

193
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,840
 which is also important, is that we seek the harmony

194
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,240
 between people and heaven.

195
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,440
 So descendants of the dragon, the land of deities,

196
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,840
 and the harmony between people and heaven

197
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,760
 are very relevant with the hearing

198
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,240
 that is taking place today.

199
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,760
 My career is in international affairs

200
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,080
 and international economics.

201
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,840
 And I have been working in the government.

202
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,560
 I have been a diplomat and a university professor.

203
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,160
 But since the 1970s, I started to spend time

204
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,200
 on the subject of UFO and the study

205
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,120
 of the mysteries of the universe.

206
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,560
 Since the establishment of the China UFO Research Institute

207
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,040
 in 1980, I have been actively involved

208
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,160
 in the leadership of the largest UFO organization in the world

209
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,600
 and later of the World Chinese UFO Federation.

210
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,400
 So I have been a witness to the history of China UFO research

211
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,200
 and also a spokesperson or an advocate, if you will.

212
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,120
 Since 1990s, I participated in a series

213
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,120
 of international conferences in Asia, Europe, North America,

214
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,280
 South America, and many other places,

215
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,920
 engaging in academic exchanges.

216
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:47,040
 I've also been interviewed by many international media

217
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,080
 on China UFO research development.

218
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:58,560
 This media include AP, BBC, CNN, NBC, Wall Street Journal,

219
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,280
 New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Christian Science

220
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,440
 Monitor, Times Magazine, and the most prestigious science

221
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,440
 and technology channel, Discovery.

222
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,360
 Of course, in addition to that, for many years,

223
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,440
 we have also been interviewed by the Chinese state media,

224
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,960
 Xinhua, and the CCTV, and many other Chinese media.

225
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:33,560
 So for the past 33 years, it's been a very hard time

226
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,440
 for Chinese UFO scholars.

227
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,040
 But we are still committed to the study of this subject.

228
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,880
 And we have gained a lot of great results,

229
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,640
 which is reflected in the following aspects.

230
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,720
 First, everyone on this planet is looking

231
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,080
 for our roots in the universe.

232
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
 We have the right to know.

233
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,880
 We have the right to discover.

234
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,960
 The mission of the Chinese UFO scholars

235
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,480
 is to help our citizens realize and implement their right

236
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,360
 to know and their right to discover.

237
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,960
 Any attempt to cover up is unacceptable.

238
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,400
 Secondly, statistics of the China UFO groups

239
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,760
 show that people involved in the subject of UFO

240
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,200
 is an overwhelming scale.

241
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,560
 According to our statistics, in China, out of 1.3 billion

242
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,000
 people, we have close to tens of millions

243
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,800
 of people who are UFO enthusiasts.

244
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,360
 And those who are interested in UFO subject

245
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,440
 or believe that UFO exists account

246
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,840
 for half of the Chinese population, which

247
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,320
 is about 500 million people.

248
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
 A group of senior scholars in the China UFO Research Institute

249
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,640
 come from various backgrounds that

250
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,920
 include scientific research agencies, aerospace, aviation,

251
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,920
 manufacturing, astronomy.

252
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,640
 And many scholars are very prestigious scholars

253
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,440
 in the society.

254
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,640
 For example, a scientist who is actively engaged with us,

255
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,120
 Mr. Chen Juesheng, Wang Gancha, and a mathematician, Mr. Chen

256
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,640
 Jingrun, and a very famous astronomer,

257
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,920
 we are working with these people frequently.

258
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:40,120
 And we actually have more than 100,000 members.

259
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,480
 This is a very big team.

260
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,720
 And we are all contributing our share to the study of UFO.

261
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,520
 Certainly, after years of research,

262
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,960
 a large number of Chinese UFO scholars, including myself,

263
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:04,520
 are convinced the authenticity of UFO, the existence of UFO

264
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,160
 and aliens.

265
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,400
 To testify the existence of the UFO and aliens,

266
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,480
 I have also written articles that

267
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,680
 have appeared in China's encyclopedia, which

268
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,880
 is a very prestigious encyclopedia in China that

269
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:36,760
 was edited by Mr. Chen Juesheng, a famous scientist in China.

270
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,080
 So we believe the existence of UFO.

271
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,560
 We believe the existence of aliens and extraterrestrials.

272
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,960
 For many years after our research and investigation,

273
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,040
 we have recorded some third kind cases,

274
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,560
 including the Fengshan Mountain incident, the Feishan incident,

275
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,920
 the Beijing Cao Gong incident, and the Luxi Farm incident,

276
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:15,880
 as well as interaction with the national civil aviation

277
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,120
 system and the military with outer space.

278
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,520
 Fourth, China has the earliest and the most recorded cases

279
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,960
 of the third kind in the world.

280
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,640
 The earliest can be traced back to 12,000 years ago,

281
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,560
 prehistoric records carved in ancient stone plate.

282
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,360
 According to our studies, up to 5,000 years of written history,

283
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,960
 there is a wealth of suspected mysterious UFO-related data

284
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:59,880
 and files, including ancient data from the ancient local

285
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,600
 governments, official documents, history,

286
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,480
 ancient scientific literature, or even in civil literary works.

287
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,880
 We see all these records, which prove that UFO does exist

288
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,000
 and also proves the real existence of the interaction

289
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,640
 between UFO and humans.

290
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,200
 Fifth, the physical evidence of an alien civilization,

291
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,560
 ancient alien statue may be the powerful evidence

292
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,440
 of this existence.

293
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,800
 We have a number of jade statues of ancient aliens,

294
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,320
 which closely resemble the aliens.

295
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,560
 I have three here for your reference.

296
00:19:46,560 --> 00:20:01,720
 They look very, very much like aliens.

297
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,480
 And our expert appraisal indicates

298
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,640
 that these statues could have been in existence for at least

299
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,880
 100 million years.

300
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,880
 This is from the studies of our geologists and archaeologists.

301
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,800
 This may also be the earliest evidence

302
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,000
 of alien civilizations' communication

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,760
 with humans or the Earth.

304
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,960
 And sixth, in China, there are thousands

305
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,560
 of alien communicators who claim to be receiving information

306
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,160
 from out of space.

307
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,840
 Some of this information has very high scientific and

308
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,760
 practical value.

309
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,280
 A few individual alien communicators

310
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,720
 claim that they have communicated

311
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,320
 with the universal source and claim

312
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,800
 to have even obtained the core secrets of the universe.

313
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,360
 These claims are viewed as controversial.

314
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,000
 We have organized a group of experts

315
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,320
 to conduct in-depth research and verification tests.

316
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:18,280
 So far, we have made some very encouraging initial results.

317
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,880
 Number seven, my last point, Chinese UFO scholars

318
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,360
 have worked independently or cooperatively

319
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,640
 with scientists and inventors in the design, the manufacture,

320
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,040
 the experiment of dozens of high-performance disc-shaped

321
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,760
 artifact with all new power systems.

322
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
 At the same time, we have conducted

323
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,160
 R&D on many important state-of-the-art technology,

324
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,200
 including new energy, environmental protection,

325
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 and pollution treatment.

326
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,160
 At the same time, we are doing research

327
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:01,640
 in high-tech areas, which includes pollution treatment,

328
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,680
 disaster prevention and mitigation, medicine

329
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,280
 and health engineering, as well as genetic engineering.

330
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:17,080
 We have also participated in the solution

331
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,440
 of finding a solution to a series of problems.

332
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,400
 But our scholars recognize that the study of the sky

333
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,200
 is for the benefit of the ground.

334
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,240
 We're doing research of the outer space

335
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,200
 because we want to benefit the Earth.

336
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,440
 We are not from outer space, but we are concerned

337
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,400
 about what's going on out there.

338
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,480
 We are not saviors, but we are doing our study

339
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,600
 because we are trying to find a solution to the problems

340
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,320
 that we face on this Earth.

341
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,760
 We're not Einstein, but our mission

342
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,320
 is to transcend what he has done,

343
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,720
 and to find the solution to solve the common problems

344
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,320
 that we face on Earth today, and to find the truth,

345
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,280
 and to meet a new era of civilization.

346
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,520
 Thank you very much.

347
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,000
 [APPLAUSE]

348
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,440
 Just want to remind all of you, we're

349
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,600
 going to come back for questionnaires

350
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,360
 after all of you have given your opening statements.

351
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,200
 So Mr. Cameron from Canada.

352
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,760
 Thank you.

353
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,560
 Some of what I have is repetitive of yesterday,

354
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,240
 so I'm just going to summarize just the first part

355
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,080
 of my testimony, which you have.

356
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,440
 I have added, however, some documents,

357
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,400
 which are as handwritten files here, which

358
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,800
 I'll refer to near the end.

359
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,240
 As I mentioned yesterday, the records

360
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,920
 for the Canadian investigation, all these records are online.

361
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,240
 The Canadian government does not dispute any of the material

362
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,480
 that is online.

363
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,940
 It should be pointed out, I believe,

364
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,920
 that the Canadian investigation from 1950 to 1954

365
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,160
 was the most open investigation of any in the world.

366
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,040
 In fact, they didn't even use the word UFO.

367
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,080
 They used the word flying saucers and flying disks.

368
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,280
 It was very open.

369
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,700
 1954, as I'll explain, an incident occurred.

370
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,440
 It was shut down.

371
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,800
 The lights went off, and that was the end of it.

372
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,160
 My testimony is based on these files

373
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,840
 and also on the personal files of Wilbert B. Smith, who

374
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,800
 was a superintendent of radio regulations

375
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,560
 for the Department of Transport and who also headed

376
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,600
 the government UFO investigation.

377
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,320
 Basically, what the story comes down to,

378
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,260
 it centers around the top secret memo, which

379
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,800
 I described yesterday.

380
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,080
 The Canadians went to the Americans in 1950.

381
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,960
 They wanted to find out what the Americans knew

382
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
 about the flying saucer phenomena,

383
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,200
 and through the military attache at the Canadian embassy

384
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,800
 and through the Canadian embassy,

385
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,960
 they made inquiries to officials at the Research and Development

386
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,920
 Board.

387
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,360
 And all that material was summed up and put

388
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,200
 in the top secret memo, which I put on record yesterday.

389
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,520
 And basically, it was summed up saying

390
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,120
 that the Americans notified the Canadians flying

391
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,680
 saucers were real.

392
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,300
 It was the most highly classified subject

393
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,320
 in the United States, rated two points higher

394
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,000
 than the hydrogen bomb.

395
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,600
 A small group headed up by President Roosevelt's former

396
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,640
 science advisor, Vannevar Bush, was

397
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,160
 in charge of the investigation.

398
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,120
 The fourth point was the American officials

399
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,480
 considered the matter to be of tremendous significance.

400
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,860
 And the fifth item, the American officials

401
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,280
 notified the Canadians that other things might

402
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,200
 be associated with the saucers, such as mental phenomena.

403
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,640
 And this mental phenomena aspect was later

404
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,840
 confirmed by two high level American sources.

405
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,600
 Smith left his personal records, which we recovered.

406
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,320
 And it showed that he was in contact with Vannevar Bush.

407
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,000
 The Canadian flying saucer investigation

408
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,560
 shows that besides tracking sighting reports,

409
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,800
 a flying saucer detection station, which

410
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,100
 I think we have a photo of, had been set up

411
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,280
 on a property provided by the Defense Research

412
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,760
 Board in Canada, where the Canadians were trying to detect

413
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,920
 a flying saucer, and actually did on August the 8th, 1954.

414
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,440
 The Canadians also-- and this was announced in a speech

415
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,880
 by Paul Hellyer in 1967, when he was the defense minister--

416
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,440
 that in 1954, the Canadians actually

417
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,000
 opened up a base, a top secret base at Suffield, Alberta,

418
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,440
 for flying saucers to land.

419
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,520
 The Canadians had made contact.

420
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,720
 They had initiated a contact, which I can describe later,

421
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,640
 where they wanted to fly over the flying saucer observatory,

422
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,600
 which it did.

423
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,480
 And they had plans which were approved at one point

424
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,200
 by the Prime Minister of Canada, the Royal Canadian Monopolis,

425
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,640
 and the Department of Defense to land a flying saucer

426
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,680
 at Suffield, Alberta.

427
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,200
 On August the 8th, 1954, the flying saucer observatory

428
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,720
 recorded an unknown object flying over.

429
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,000
 And this can actually be seen in FBI documents

430
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,960
 to describe the planning for this.

431
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,680
 When this was written up in the press,

432
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,800
 the flying saucer investigation was completely shut down.

433
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,000
 Nothing really happened.

434
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 All the Canadians followed the American lead in the late 1960s.

435
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,360
 They shut the program down.

436
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,280
 All the files are moved to the National Research Council.

437
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,400
 The files today are actually sent

438
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,840
 to a researcher in my city, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

439
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,600
 None of the top secret, none of the secret,

440
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,240
 but all the siting reports are actually

441
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,880
 sent to an investigator from the Canadian government.

442
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,800
 And that investigator puts out a report every year

443
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,840
 based upon those sitings and other sitings that he gets.

444
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
 After Wilbur Smith's personal files

445
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,560
 were made public in 1982, more details

446
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,240
 related to the United States-Canadian Joint Flying

447
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,520
 Saucer Investigation were made public.

448
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,560
 Smith's letters showed that he was receiving

449
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,920
 UFO hardware from the United States authorities to analyze.

450
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,180
 When I asked his metallurgist, Arthur Bridge,

451
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,200
 how much material they had actually handled,

452
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,240
 he replied, tons of it.

453
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,760
 In interviews with Smith shortly before his death,

454
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,720
 he told a group of visiting researchers from Ohio

455
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,080
 that the United States military has tons of hardware,

456
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,200
 and they also had much film.

457
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,040
 Smith spelled out to researchers that the hardware was controlled

458
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,640
 by US government officials and not the US Air Force.

459
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,960
 Smith's oldest son testified on record a number of times

460
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,200
 that his father confirmed to him before he died

461
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,760
 that he had been shown a downed flying saucer and the bodies

462
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,000
 by American officials.

463
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,740
 Smith's files were identified two sources, Dr. Vannevar Bush

464
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,160
 and Dr. Robert Saubacher, who--

465
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,560
 these are the letters I'd like to refer to now.

466
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,280
 Dr. Robert Saubacher was identified by the Saturday

467
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,760
 Evening Post as the boy genius.

468
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,560
 He ran the Washington Institute of Technology.

469
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,320
 He was the dean of graduate studies at Georgia Tech.

470
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,960
 And in the 1950s, he co-authored a university textbook on hyper

471
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,640
 and ultra-high frequency engineering

472
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,640
 for US universities.

473
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,760
 He was one of the main contacts

474
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,480
 that the Canadians were put in contact with.

475
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,840
 And you can see on the opening of the Saubacher notes here,

476
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,280
 I have highlighted one particular point because one

477
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,920
 of the congressmen brought up yesterday whether we have a

478
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,720
 document that actually talks about alien bodies.

479
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,880
 This is a transcript that Wilbur Smith made of the interview

480
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,400
 that was done at the Canadian Embassy in September of 1950.

481
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,240
 And he's talking to Saubacher and the question he asks,

482
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,560
 and I have it highlighted there, I have read Scully's book

483
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,200
 on the saucers and would like to know how much of it is true.

484
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,340
 The Scully book was a book written on crash flying saucers.

485
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,480
 It reported to be a crash at Aztec New Mexico in March

486
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,840
 of 1948 recovering bodies and a craft.

487
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,960
 Smith asked Saubacher how much of this book is true.

488
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,560
 Saubacher's reply is the facts reported

489
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,920
 in the book are substantially correct.

490
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,480
 I'd also like to refer to you what happened was

491
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,040
 in 1982 Wilbur Smith's files were made public

492
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,120
 and everybody learned the fact that Saubacher was the main

493
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,600
 witness in the United States providing material

494
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,040
 to the Canadians and everybody started to chase him.

495
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,760
 Stanton Friedman has an extensive audio interview with him

496
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,520
 that you can actually get on the internet.

497
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,280
 I refer you to a letter here

498
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,680
 from the Washington Institute of Technology.

499
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,880
 This is to a researcher in California, Bill Steinman,

500
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,920
 who writes to Dr. Saubacher and trying to confirm to him,

501
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,600
 is this true, what is the deal here?

502
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,920
 Saubacher had told Stanton Friedman that what had happened

503
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,960
 was in 1950 there was a briefings

504
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,840
 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base of a downed saucer

505
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,640
 and bodies that he couldn't go to the meeting but he was

506
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,360
 in the Navy office in Washington DC and listened

507
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,880
 to all the high ranking scientists who had come back

508
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,640
 from the briefing and told him what was going on.

509
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,200
 In this letter on page two he basically says,

510
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,680
 I recall the interview with Dr. Bremner

511
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,840
 at the Canadian Embassy, I think I gave the answer

512
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,280
 so he confirms these handwritten briefings that I,

513
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,880
 or notes that I showed you.

514
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,600
 He said, the only thing I can remember is

515
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,640
 that certain materials reported to come

516
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,480
 from flying saucers were extremely light and very tough.

517
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,600
 I'm sure the laboratories analyzed them.

518
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,440
 And then he confirms in this letter that he signs in 1983

519
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,200
 that there were bodies, that he was told about bodies.

520
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,880
 In the interview with Stanton Friedman,

521
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,680
 he's a little more specific but you have a letter here

522
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,800
 of a high ranking American official that the Canadians got

523
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,240
 in contact with that confirmed

524
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,280
 that the Americans did have bodies

525
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,960
 and they did have a craft.

526
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,640
 What he did, and this is the last part of my testimony,

527
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,280
 Stanton Friedman was talking to him and he said,

528
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,960
 can you tell me who was at the meeting?

529
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,320
 He identified a number of people.

530
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,360
 All the people that he identified were dead until he came

531
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,880
 to the fact that there was one person from Pennsylvania who was

532
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,560
 at all the meetings and knew what was going on.

533
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,040
 That engineer, Dr. Eric Walker, confirmed to Bill Steinman

534
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,320
 that he had attended the Wright-Patterson Air Force meetings.

535
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,320
 Walker had held many top jobs such as 15 years

536
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,960
 as the President of Penn State University.

537
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,760
 He was Chairman of the Board of the Institute

538
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,560
 for Defense Analysis, the top military think tank used

539
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,040
 by the Department of Defense.

540
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,320
 He was Chairman of the National Science Foundation.

541
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,240
 He was Executive Secretary of the Research

542
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,240
 and Development Board and headed the Navy's Applied Research Lab

543
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,720
 at State College, Pennsylvania.

544
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,400
 In discussions with more than half a dozen researchers

545
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,280
 over eight years, Dr. Walker tried not to talk

546
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,240
 about the subject, but he did confirm

547
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,720
 that there were ET recoveries, communication with aliens,

548
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,520
 and that there was a secret control group

549
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,920
 that was overseeing the entire subject.

550
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,040
 After Dr. Walker's death, his son, Brian Walker,

551
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,040
 confirmed that there had been a file that contained a number

552
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,920
 of official government documents.

553
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,760
 He claimed he did not read them.

554
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,760
 He recalls that there were drawings, but did not mention

555
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,880
 whether it was of bodies or disks.

556
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,120
 He claimed that the file containing the information

557
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,920
 in Penn-- there was information about a crash in Pennsylvania

558
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,280
 and one in the western United States.

559
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,080
 He thinks he just-- his father destroyed the file before his

560
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,200
 death because when he moved the files from the house

561
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,960
 to Penn State University, the file was no longer there.

562
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,800
 And that's my statement.

563
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,120
 Thank you.

564
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,400
 >> Thank you.

565
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,200
 [ Applause ]

566
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,760
 >> Mr. Pope, welcome back.

567
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,480
 >> Thank you.

568
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,480
 Madam Chair, Representatives, Senator,

569
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,000
 you should all have a printed out copy of my opening statement

570
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,600
 but with your permission, I'll read it onto the record.

571
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,800
 >> Okay, thank you.

572
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,200
 >> The UK Ministry of Defense is an organization broadly analogous

573
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,200
 to the US Department of Defense and has a dual role both

574
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,760
 as a policymaking department of state

575
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,200
 and as the UK's highest level military headquarters.

576
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,760
 I worked there for 21 years as a civilian, three of which were

577
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,600
 spent on MOD's UFO project.

578
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,080
 That's a job I had from 1991 to 1994.

579
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,960
 The MOD's UFO project ran from 1953 to 2009 and in that time,

580
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,520
 over 12,000 sightings were investigated.

581
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,400
 MOD's role here was to research and investigate the phenomenon

582
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,360
 to determine whether there was evidence of any potential threat

583
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,760
 to the defense of the UK or anything

584
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,160
 of more general defense interest.

585
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,960
 The UK's interest in UFOs had its roots in concerns

586
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
 that some objects might be foreign military aircraft

587
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,960
 on reconnaissance missions or on missions

588
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,120
 to test the capabilities and effectiveness

589
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,560
 of our air defense network, both in terms of radar

590
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,800
 and air defense aircraft.

591
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,040
 The work we did was very similar to the work done

592
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,760
 by the US government's UFO program embedded

593
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,560
 in the United States Air Force under a number

594
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,880
 of different project names,

595
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,560
 the best known of which was Project Blue Book.

596
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,840
 The UK's program had no formal project name.

597
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,440
 Our conclusions were that most sightings could be explained

598
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,000
 as misidentifications of known objects or phenomena.

599
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,720
 However, around 5% appeared to defy conventional explanation

600
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,120
 and were of considerable interest.

601
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,600
 We took no position on the nature of these sightings

602
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,080
 and remained open-minded as to the possibilities.

603
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,800
 Accordingly, while we were aware of no evidence

604
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,320
 that would support the theory

605
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,800
 that any UFO sightings were attributable

606
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,800
 to extraterrestrial life, we didn't entirely rule

607
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,640
 out that possibility.

608
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,200
 It was regarded as a low-probability, high-consequence

609
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,560
 scenario, which is why from time to time the possibility was

610
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,280
 at least considered in internal MOD discussions.

611
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,840
 Despite the wider societal implications,

612
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,000
 MOD's interest was narrowly focused

613
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,120
 on technology acquisition.

614
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,400
 Scientific and technical intelligence experts

615
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,360
 in MOD's defense intelligence staff were not averse

616
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,640
 to speculating about exotic energy sources,

617
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,840
 propulsion systems or aerodynamics in relation to UFOs.

618
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,360
 And perhaps the most graphic illustration

619
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,040
 of this was a defense intelligence staff document

620
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,680
 from 1995 which read in part, "If the sightings are

621
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,720
 of devices not of this earth, then their purpose needs

622
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,280
 to be established as a matter of priority.

623
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,200
 There has been no apparent hostile intent

624
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,320
 and other possibilities are, one, military reconnaissance,

625
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,800
 two, scientific, three, tourism."

626
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
 [ Laughter ]

627
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,800
 The intent was practical as the document went on to set out,

628
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,200
 quote, "We could use this technology if it exists."

629
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,160
 Though we accepted UFO reports from everyone,

630
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,520
 and indeed the vast majority of those reports came to us

631
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,800
 from the public, the sightings that were of most interest were

632
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,000
 those where the witnesses were police officers, pilots,

633
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,960
 or military personnel.

634
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,160
 And when I say pilots, I mean both civil aircraft pilots

635
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,640
 and military pilots.

636
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,840
 We were also particularly interested in sightings

637
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,600
 where there was some corroborative evidence,

638
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,520
 e.g. in terms of radar data or a photograph or film

639
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,360
 that specialist imagery analysis staff could evaluate.

640
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,800
 Of particular concern to us were a number of incidents

641
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,080
 where there were near misses

642
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,720
 between UFOs and commercial aircraft.

643
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,960
 There are several such cases in the MOD's UFO files

644
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,840
 and in the files of the Civil Aviation Authority,

645
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,320
 which is a UK government agency broadly equivalent

646
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,040
 to the US FAA.

647
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,240
 The UK's best known and most compelling UFO incident is a

648
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,520
 series of sightings that occurred in December 1980,

649
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,240
 collectively known as either the Rendlesham Forest incident

650
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,880
 or the Bentwaters incident,

651
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,120
 and the committee has already taken evidence on this.

652
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,280
 In the late '90s, the MOD's defense intelligence staff

653
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,040
 commissioned a review of many of the UFO sightings

654
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,560
 that MOD had investigated over the years.

655
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,280
 This intelligence analysis was known as Project Condyne,

656
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,040
 which was a randomly generated code word.

657
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,960
 And this attempted some trend analysis of the reports received

658
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,640
 as opposed to reinvestigation of individual cases.

659
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,040
 The final report was published in the year 2000 and ran

660
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
 to over 400 pages.

661
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,880
 The title was Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

662
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,560
 in the UK Air Defense Region.

663
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,280
 The MOD often uses the phrase UAP,

664
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,640
 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, in internal correspondence,

665
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,880
 so as to avoid the unfortunate stigma

666
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,520
 that comes from the term UFO.

667
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,280
 At the time, Project Condyne's final report was classified

668
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,600
 secret UK eyes only.

669
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,320
 Its controversial conclusion was

670
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,200
 that some UFO sightings might be attributable

671
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,080
 to exotic atmospheric plasmas,

672
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,080
 and that there might be novel military applications,

673
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,760
 e.g. in terms of directed energy weapons,

674
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,160
 that might merit further study.

675
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,520
 Again, the air safety implications

676
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,240
 of the phenomenon were judged to be an important part,

677
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,400
 and one recommendation of the study read as follows,

678
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,320
 no attempt should be made to outmaneuver a UAP

679
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,440
 during interception.

680
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,360
 Another recommendation stated, at higher altitudes,

681
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,440
 although UAP appear to be benign to civil air traffic,

682
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,400
 pilots should be advised not to maneuver other

683
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,720
 than to place the object astern if possible.

684
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,480
 A redacted version of Project Condyne's final report was made

685
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,320
 available to the public in May 2006, following a number

686
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,400
 of Freedom of Information Act requests.

687
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,800
 There is in the UK, as in the US, a widely held belief

688
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,040
 that the authorities know more about UFOs

689
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,480
 than they're telling the public, i.e. that there's a coverup

690
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,640
 and a conspiracy on the subject.

691
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,520
 I think there are two relevant factors here.

692
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,520
 Firstly, the MOD was and still is an inherently secretive

693
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,800
 organization despite the introduction

694
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,480
 of the UK's Freedom of Information Act.

695
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,040
 Secondly, it was the longstanding policy of the MOD

696
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,520
 to downplay the extent of the department's interest

697
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,680
 and the scope of our official research and investigation,

698
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,440
 not all of which, especially post-Freedom

699
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,160
 of Information Act, generated the paper trail

700
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,760
 that one might expect and hope for.

701
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,880
 To give a practical example of this,

702
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,960
 we consistently told the UK's Parliament, the media

703
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,440
 and the public that UFOs were of limited interest

704
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,480
 and "no defense significance,"

705
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,440
 while highly classified intelligence studies

706
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,760
 such as Project Condyne were being carried

707
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,320
 out away from public scrutiny.

708
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,360
 That said, despite the secrecy and despite the downplaying

709
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,160
 of MOD's UFO-related work, I'm not aware of any coverup

710
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,560
 or conspiracy in the sense that proponents

711
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,800
 of such theories mean.

712
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,800
 MOD's UFO project was terminated in 2009 as part

713
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,360
 of a wider series of defense cuts,

714
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,160
 and while the public no longer have an official point

715
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,320
 of contact for their sightings, pilots can and do continue

716
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,560
 to make reports on an ad hoc basis, though they tend

717
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,440
 to avoid the phrase UFO or indeed UAP.

718
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,480
 And in my experience now tend to use phrases

719
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,800
 such as "unusual aircraft."

720
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,080
 In 2007, the MOD made a policy decision to declassify

721
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,160
 and release its entire archive of UFO files,

722
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,880
 following a similar decision made

723
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,040
 by the French government in 2007.

724
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,640
 This five-year program,

725
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,360
 in which I've been personally involved, began with the release

726
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,680
 of the first batch of files in May 2008.

727
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,520
 Subsequent batches followed,

728
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,840
 and the program reaches its climax this year.

729
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,920
 To date, over 50,000 pages of documents have been sent

730
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,000
 to the UK's National Archives.

731
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,640
 The UK and France are two of a number of nations

732
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,120
 that have opened their UFO files recently in response to pressure

733
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,840
 from media and the public, and again,

734
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,320
 the committee's had some testimony on that.

735
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,400
 In concluding, I should say

736
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,120
 that I do not have a single neat explanation for the UFO mystery,

737
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,840
 and neither am I aware that anyone

738
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,920
 in the UK government has or had reached a definitive conclusion.

739
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,280
 However, having undertaken three years

740
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,400
 of official UK government research and investigation

741
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,600
 into the UFO phenomenon, my belief, my assessment,

742
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,760
 is that whatever the true nature of the phenomenon,

743
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,040
 it raises important defense, national security,

744
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,800
 and air safety issues.

745
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,960
 Additionally, as pointed out in Project Condine's final report,

746
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,440
 there are potential novel technology applications

747
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,560
 and military applications that may result

748
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,840
 from a proper scientific study of the phenomenon.

749
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,360
 And finally, and perhaps most importantly in relation

750
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,800
 to this event, and I think we heard it most graphically

751
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,800
 with the testimony from Sergeants Penniston and Burroughs

752
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,440
 and their ongoing quest for their medical records,

753
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,800
 I think it's clear that, again, whatever the nature

754
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,760
 of this phenomenon and this mystery, there are issues

755
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,440
 of political accountability, open government,

756
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,160
 and freedom of information here.

757
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,480
 Thank you.

758
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:41,720
 [ Applause ]

759
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,640
 >> If I may call you Antonio.

760
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:43,960
 >> Yes.

761
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,120
 >> Welcome back.

762
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,280
 >> Thank you.

763
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,720
 So good afternoon distinguished members and panelists

764
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,320
 of the Citizen Hearing on UFOs.

765
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,680
 Today we're discussing official investigations

766
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,120
 from various countries around the world.

767
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,800
 Among those nations that have conducted some kind

768
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,960
 of official UFO research besides the United States

769
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,120
 and South America, which have been dealt in previous sessions,

770
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,120
 we can mention Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium,

771
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,960
 Spain, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Ukraine, Poland, Australia,

772
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,000
 and New Zealand to cite a few.

773
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,880
 We have with us experts that will discuss

774
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,440
 or had just discussed some of these countries like Italy,

775
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,320
 the UK, Canada, and China, but no representatives

776
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,800
 from the other nations.

777
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,760
 So I will cover briefly the history

778
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,160
 of official investigations

779
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,920
 of two particularly important countries, France and Russia,

780
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,160
 which have a rich amount of material in this field.

781
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,200
 Let's start with France, a country that has one

782
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,440
 of the oldest, continuous, and most rational approaches

783
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,200
 to the UFO problem.

784
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,160
 Some military investigations in France go back to the '50s,

785
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,800
 but the current program really took off in the mid-'70s

786
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,200
 when a series of important steps were taken

787
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,880
 by the French government.

788
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,200
 In 1974, the Minister of Defense, Robert Galli,

789
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,720
 admitted in a famous radio interview that, quote,

790
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,680
 "The massive reports coming

791
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,280
 in from the gendarmerie were pretty disturbing."

792
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,000
 The minister added that, quote, "I believe that the attitude

793
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,120
 of spirit that we must adopt vis-a-vis the phenomenon is an

794
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,760
 open one, that is to say that it doesn't consist

795
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,400
 in denying a priori as our ancestors

796
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,160
 of previous centuries did deny many things

797
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,120
 that seem nowadays perfectly elementary," end quote.

798
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,640
 The National Gendarmerie, which is a national police force,

799
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,800
 similar to our state troopers,

800
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,120
 had been investigating UFO incidents since the '60s,

801
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,040
 including a famous UFO landing and close encounter

802
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,720
 of the third kind, CE-3, cases where humanoid beings

803
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,080
 or UFO occupants are seen in connection with the sighting

804
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,160
 in Val-en-Salle in 1965.

805
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,040
 Ten years later, the gendarmerie formalized its UFO protocols

806
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,680
 by issuing instructions that gendarmes

807
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,000
 throughout the French territory, including those overseas

808
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,360
 like French Guyana or Reunion Island

809
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,840
 in the Indian Ocean, should respond

810
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,960
 and investigate any UFO incident reported by French citizens.

811
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,200
 These protocols are still current.

812
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,200
 In 1977, the Institute of High Studies of National Defense,

813
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,160
 or IHEDN, a key think tank of the French military,

814
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,960
 released an important study which recommended establishment

815
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,120
 of a permanent agency to study UFOs.

816
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,640
 This was accomplished later that year when the CNAS,

817
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,960
 the French space agency equivalent to our NASA,

818
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,040
 created the study group of unidentified aerospace phenomena,

819
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,440
 GEPAN, under the direction of aerospace engineer Claude Poher,

820
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,920
 who had conducted UFO research on his own

821
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,640
 for a number of years.

822
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,440
 One of his first tasks was to conduct a statistical study

823
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,840
 of 354 UFO cases collected by the gendarmerie, 25%

824
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,440
 of which remained unexplained.

825
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,480
 On the morning of January 8, 1981,

826
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,400
 GEPAN's most important case took place.

827
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,400
 A UFO landed on the property of a farmer in Transan-Provence

828
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,240
 in the Valle region of southwest France.

829
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,560
 Although the case had only one witness,

830
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:32,280
 the farmer Renato Nicolai, the case became important

831
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,120
 because of the physical evidence left by the UFO

832
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,440
 on the alfalfa field, which was analyzed scientifically

833
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,000
 by a number of French laboratories.

834
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,160
 Among other things, the alfalfa leaves lost from 30

835
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,680
 to 50% of chlorophyll, and the traces on the terrain were still

836
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,480
 perceptible 40 days after the event,

837
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,720
 according to the official report.

838
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,240
 Stranger still was what an official GEPAN chart--

839
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,280
 and I don't know if we have it on the--

840
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,600
 I had given it previously, so hopefully it

841
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,840
 will appear on the screen, the chart.

842
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,360
 Stranger was what an official GEPAN chart characterized

843
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,600
 as, quote, "time-space effect."

844
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,400
 Professor Buñaz, one of the scientists who conducted

845
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,480
 the analysis, explained that while the plants were

846
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,400
 physiologically young, after the UFO landing,

847
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,720
 they presented-- and I'm quoting now--

848
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,360
 "the biochemical characteristics of leaves

849
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,200
 of an advanced age," old leaves.

850
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,440
 So in other words, they were young plants.

851
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,000
 After the UFO landed, they became biochemically old.

852
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,080
 And that, according to the scientists,

853
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,320
 doesn't happen in nature.

854
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,480
 The final conclusion of the GEPAN chart

855
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,720
 was, quote, "physical phenomenon of unexplained nature,

856
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,600
 high probability of electromagnetic mode

857
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,640
 of propulsion."

858
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,240
 Despite this and other significant cases

859
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,840
 investigated and documented by GEPAN,

860
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,760
 the agency was downgraded in the mid-'80s,

861
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,040
 and the name was changed to SEPRA,

862
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,480
 an acronym for the Reentry of Atmospheric Objects.

863
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,780
 Although the agency continued to investigate UFO cases

864
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,240
 under the direction of Jean-Jacques Velasco, who

865
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,160
 was the case investigator of the Trans-Improvance incident.

866
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,800
 In 2007, however, a new reorganization took place,

867
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,720
 and the name was changed again to GEPAN--

868
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,440
 so they added an I there--

869
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,720
 Study and Information Group of Unidentified Aerospace

870
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,920
 Phenomena.

871
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,440
 GEPAN also launched a comprehensive website

872
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,240
 and began the process of releasing

873
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,280
 all of its documents, which are now

874
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,040
 available within the CNS portal.

875
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,600
 That's the French Space Agency.

876
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,560
 Parallel to the official GEPAN and gendarmerie investigations,

877
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,040
 there has also been some highly interesting semi-official

878
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,680
 reports from groups connected to the French military,

879
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,920
 intelligence, and aeronautical establishment.

880
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,000
 The first and most famous one was the so-called cometa report

881
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,300
 of 1999, entitled UFOs and Defense--

882
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,600
 What Should We Prepare For?

883
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,680
 Although not an official government report

884
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,080
 in the strict sense of the word, cometa

885
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,040
 was composed of a group of retired, high ranking

886
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,280
 military and intelligence officers

887
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,880
 under the direction of retired Major General Dennis Letty.

888
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,280
 Their conclusion that UFOs were definitely real and most

889
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,720
 likely of extraterrestrial origin were very strong.

890
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,240
 More recently, another quasi-official organization,

891
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,360
 the 3AF, which stands for the Aeronautical and Astronomical

892
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,560
 Association of France, created a high level study

893
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,800
 group known as the Sigma Commission

894
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,240
 under the direction of Alain Boudier.

895
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,080
 Sigma has recently completed a long report,

896
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,880
 again confirming the existence of a real UFO

897
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,040
 phenomenon of likely ET origin.

898
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,060
 From all of this material briefly outlined

899
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,880
 in this presentation, you can see that the French are

900
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,760
 undoubtedly among the leading nations

901
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,080
 to conduct significant UFO research,

902
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,640
 both officially and semi-officially.

903
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,200
 Instead of burying their heads in the sand,

904
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,920
 pretending that a UFO phenomenon doesn't exist

905
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,520
 or is not important, France, the cradle of rationalism

906
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,720
 in the modern era, have taken an aggressive approach

907
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,260
 towards solving this phenomenon.

908
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,680
 Let me outline now very briefly the history of UFO research

909
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,360
 in Russia and the old Soviet Union.

910
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,080
 In the early days of communism, the subject of UFOs

911
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,320
 was heavily censored, although some research was conducted

912
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,120
 privately by a few scientists, such as the late Professor

913
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,320
 Felix Siegel, an astronomer with the Moscow Aviation Institute

914
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,720
 who is considered the father of Russian ufology.

915
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,280
 Things began to change after a highly publicized event

916
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,040
 in Petrosovodsk in Karelia, northern Russia in September

917
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,000
 of 1977, which led to the creation of a commission

918
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,720
 for the study of anomalous phenomena attached to the USSR

919
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,520
 Academy of Sciences.

920
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,640
 This commission was public since it solicited reports

921
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,640
 from the Soviet citizenry.

922
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,840
 Not known to the public, however,

923
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,280
 was the second secret study conducted

924
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,680
 by the KGB and the Soviet Ministry of Defense,

925
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,600
 although its existence was not revealed

926
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,960
 until after the breakdown of the USSR in 1990.

927
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,680
 Eventually, some military and KGB files from this commission

928
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,000
 were released in the '90s, including

929
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,560
 incidents involving UFO flyings over nuclear facilities.

930
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,660
 One of the most interesting cases in the KGB file

931
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,600
 is a multiple witness CE-1 close encounter of the first kind

932
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,040
 at a top secret army missile base

933
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,320
 in the district of Kapustin Yar, Astrakhan region,

934
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,440
 on the night of July 28, 29, 1989.

935
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,240
 The file is surely incomplete, but still

936
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,280
 offers an interesting glimpse into the maneuverability

937
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,720
 of UFOs.

938
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,920
 The dossier consists of the depositions

939
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,120
 of seven military witnesses, two junior officers,

940
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,680
 a corporal, and four privates, plus illustrations

941
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,120
 of the object by the observers and a briefcase summary

942
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,680
 by an unnamed KGB officer.

943
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,400
 One of the depositions mentions a disc-shaped object moving,

944
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,760
 quote, "in the direction of the rocket's weapons depot,"

945
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,680
 and then hovering over the depot and emitting a bright beam.

946
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,640
 Another case from 1982 involved a series

947
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,160
 of sightings of UFOs over a nuclear missile

948
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,000
 base near Usovo, Ukraine, which coincided

949
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,680
 with the malfunction of the computerized console

950
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,080
 controlling the launch of nuclear weapons.

951
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,320
 This was obviously of great concern to the Soviet military,

952
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,120
 and is quite similar to the events at Malmstrom Air Force

953
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,080
 Base in Montana discussed in another session of these hearings.

954
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,120
 It is perhaps due to these kinds of incidents involving

955
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,720
 nuclear weapons that a curious clause about, quote,

956
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,960
 "unidentified objects" was added to an agreement on measures

957
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,240
 to reduce the risk of nuclear war

958
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,080
 between the United States of America

959
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,960
 and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

960
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,440
 The agreement was part of a policy of detente

961
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,920
 during the Nixon and early Brezhnev administrations.

962
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,960
 It was signed on September 30, 1971,

963
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,480
 by Secretary of State William Rogers and Foreign Minister

964
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,400
 Andrei Gromyko.

965
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,880
 The agreement has nine articles on issues

966
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,280
 such as informing each other, quote,

967
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,040
 "against the accidental or unauthorized use

968
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,640
 of nuclear weapons under its control,"

969
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,320
 notification in advance of missile launches that

970
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,200
 go beyond the national territory of each country,

971
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,320
 and other measures of cooperation

972
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,400
 in order to avert, quote, "the risk of outbreak of nuclear war."

973
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,480
 Article 3 reads, I'm quoting, "the parties undertake

974
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,080
 to notify each other immediately in the event of detection

975
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,480
 by missile warning systems of unidentified objects

976
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,360
 or in the event of signs of interference

977
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,120
 with these systems or with the related communication

978
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,800
 facilities if such occurrences could

979
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,360
 create a risk of outbreak of nuclear war

980
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,440
 between the two countries."

981
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,120
 It's a good thing that they signed this agreement.

982
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,160
 Several UFO cases involving Russian cosmonauts

983
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,680
 have also become public over the years.

984
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,600
 One of the most interesting was a report

985
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,000
 by cosmonaut Major General Vladimir Kovalyonok

986
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,600
 from the Salyut 6 space station on May 5, 1981.

987
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,400
 The sighting of a pulsating round object,

988
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,160
 which resembled a melon--

989
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,560
 that's his quote--

990
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,520
 and then became like a barbell and didn't resemble

991
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,440
 any cosmic objects unfamiliar with,

992
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,800
 was admitted on the record in a videotaped interview

993
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,400
 by the cosmonaut many years later.

994
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,640
 Another cosmonaut, Major General Pavel Popovich,

995
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,320
 even became, at one point, the president of the All Union

996
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,440
 Ufology Association of the Commonwealth

997
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,240
 of Independent States.

998
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,880
 A quote from a 1992 paper by General Popovich

999
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,560
 provides an appropriate ending to this brief presentation.

1000
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,920
 He wrote, quote, "The UFO sightings

1001
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,720
 have become the constant component of human activity

1002
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,880
 and require a serious global study.

1003
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,640
 In order to realize the position of man on Earth

1004
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,060
 and in the universe, ufology, the scientific study

1005
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,760
 of the UFO phenomenon, should take place

1006
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,200
 in the midst of other sciences dealing with man and the world."

1007
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
 Thank you very much.

1008
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,140
 [APPLAUSE]

1009
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:48,520
 We're going to go through one round of questions.

1010
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,240
 And we will-- each of you get five minutes.

1011
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,200
 And then when we come back after break,

1012
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,240
 you'll have another chance to go through.

1013
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:03,360
 So let's start with Representative Cook.

1014
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,000
 Thank you, Madam Chair.

1015
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,120
 Let's-- I'd first like to ask a question of our witness

1016
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:15,840
 from the UK, Nick Pope.

1017
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,400
 I remember some of your biography from yesterday,

1018
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,640
 but remind me, you did work for the Ministry of Defense

1019
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,320
 in the UK.

1020
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,720
 That's correct, sir, yes.

1021
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,520
 You are currently not working for the Ministry of Defense.

1022
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,900
 Am I correct on that?

1023
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,480
 Correct, sir.

1024
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,000
 I left in 2006.

1025
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,640
 2006.

1026
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,520
 And then you've been very involved

1027
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,400
 in this study of UFOs since that time.

1028
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,820
 Since you left-- well, while you were there.

1029
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,600
 And certainly, you've been involved since you left.

1030
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,400
 Yes, sir, in a private capacity.

1031
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,240
 In a private capacity, I understand, at this time.

1032
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,040
 OK, and of course, you're telling us--

1033
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,120
 and this is really interesting to me--

1034
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:59,560
 that the Ministry of Defense's project on UFOs

1035
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,120
 lasted from 1953, which is essentially

1036
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,280
 the same year close to when Project Blue Book in the United

1037
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,040
 States started.

1038
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,920
 But you went all the way to 2009 in the UK with your project,

1039
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,640
 although you don't have a fancy name for it, or any name for it.

1040
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,680
 Am I right?

1041
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,560
 Yes, sir.

1042
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,200
 If you'll excuse the pun, I think

1043
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,480
 we were even worse resourced than Project Blue Book.

1044
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,760
 OK, fair enough.

1045
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:32,280
 But you collected-- you've investigated 12,000 sightings.

1046
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:37,200
 And I guess it was 2007, or currently, at least,

1047
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,160
 over 50,000 pages of documents have been sent to the archives

1048
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,400
 for scholars like yourself and any other scholar

1049
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,120
 here to be looking at.

1050
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,880
 Am I correct?

1051
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,200
 So they're open files.

1052
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,560
 They are--

1053
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,000
 Or are-- well, let's explain.

1054
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,680
 Tell me-- I don't want to put words in your mouth.

1055
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,600
 What are those files?

1056
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,560
 Are they open, closed, kind of high clearance to get it to--

1057
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,640
 go ahead.

1058
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:04,040
 The material is at the UK National Archives website.

1059
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,920
 And I'm afraid to say there is a small charge for access.

1060
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,640
 But--

1061
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,440
 Having said that, if you're prepared to pay that small charge,

1062
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,120
 they're all open.

1063
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,240
 But many of the investigators here that have been witnesses

1064
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,120
 would have no problem with that small charge, I'm sure.

1065
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,760
 Yes, sir.

1066
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,360
 So I can imagine you, being as interested as you are,

1067
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,680
 have looked at a lot of these documents.

1068
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,440
 Or maybe you've even read every one of them.

1069
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,200
 I don't know.

1070
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,960
 Would you explain to what extent you've analyzed these?

1071
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,120
 When I did that job, I made it my business

1072
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,200
 to research back into the archive

1073
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,320
 and look at the historical documents.

1074
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,360
 So I went right back to the inception.

1075
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,880
 And indeed, though the formal project started in 1953,

1076
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,640
 we did have a look at some sightings on an ad hoc basis

1077
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,880
 even before then.

1078
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,360
 And indeed, we had some reports during the Second World War.

1079
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,440
 At the time, the phrase "foo fighters" was used

1080
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,960
 for these things, subsequently "ghost rockets."

1081
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,240
 And you described what you felt was the feeling of the MOD,

1082
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,000
 at least when you were in the ministry,

1083
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,280
 of giving some but low probability of ET origins

1084
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,520
 to the UFOs that were studied.

1085
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,040
 Am I correct in what you've testified to?

1086
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,000
 I think it's more--

1087
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,400
 You said low probability but high consequence.

1088
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,880
 Certainly nobody would question high consequence.

1089
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,960
 Some might question low priority.

1090
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,560
 But was that their official position

1091
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,760
 with all this work done?

1092
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,800
 I think it was more a case, sir, that we

1093
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,640
 couldn't rule that possibility out.

1094
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,160
 We said it was a sort of non-zero possibility.

1095
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,680
 But now I'm particularly interested,

1096
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,320
 not in the official ministry position.

1097
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
 Because I know how politics works.

1098
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:57,240
 And as you say, these are your words, sir.

1099
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,880
 The UK acts like a lap dog to the United States.

1100
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,080
 OK, so here's what I'm going to ask you.

1101
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,320
 What's your opinion after all the research you've done?

1102
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:09,040
 And based on all that stuff that you've had access to,

1103
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:15,000
 is there an ET origin to what's obviously been accurate--

1104
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,360
 or I should say sightings of real UFOs?

1105
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,200
 Now having sighted-- we're just repeating the concept

1106
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,680
 that having sighted a UFO is not the same thing as saying

1107
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,080
 there's an extraterrestrial component.

1108
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,080
 I want to know your opinion of that based on all that stuff

1109
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,080
 that you have investigated.

1110
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,080
 I think, sir, I would say that the evidence doesn't

1111
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,360
 go quite far enough for me to say personally

1112
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,360
 that I am absolutely sure we're being visited.

1113
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,800
 But I certainly think it is compelling enough

1114
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,440
 that it is a possibility.

1115
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,440
 I know, sir, that's a fancy way of saying I don't know.

1116
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,040
 I apologize.

1117
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:53,400
 Fair enough.

1118
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,560
 I've got just a minute left.

1119
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,480
 So I wanted to get to Grant Cameron.

1120
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,520
 I'll be able to do that on the second round anyway.

1121
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,280
 But this 1950 Wilbert Smith thing

1122
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,000
 is showing illumination on a question I brought up,

1123
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,480
 I think, to you or to somebody yesterday on ET--

1124
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,720
 or I should say, let's use the word bodies.

1125
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,320
 Bodies-- witnesses talked about bodies concurrently

1126
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,360
 with seeing those bodies.

1127
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,160
 And it's documented that they talked about it at the time,

1128
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,280
 not a lot later.

1129
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,800
 There was something about Wilbert Smith's--

1130
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,480
 I think it was Skully Book.

1131
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,960
 Would you elaborate on that if you could?

1132
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,240
 I think the point that you were making yesterday

1133
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,040
 was in one of the documents that says in the Project Magnet

1134
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,480
 report that extraterrestrials was highly

1135
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,400
 probable for the result.

1136
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,960
 And that's when you asked, is there

1137
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,360
 any documents that actually refer to extraterrestrials

1138
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,040
 rather than that it's confirmed?

1139
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,360
 So what I have put forward is this idea

1140
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,280
 that when the Canadians went to the Americans,

1141
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,040
 the first question they asked was

1142
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,760
 related to this Frank Skully book

1143
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,600
 that was published in 1950.

1144
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,200
 This is when the interview took place.

1145
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,240
 And the first question he asked is Skully's book

1146
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,560
 about the crash of Aztec New Mexico,

1147
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,600
 how much of that book is accurate?

1148
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,240
 And that's when he says the vast majority of the material

1149
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,440
 is accurate.

1150
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,680
 I know the time's expired.

1151
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,120
 I'll probably pick up with that on next round.

1152
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,480
 Thank you.

1153
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,240
 Thank you.

1154
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,240
 Let's go to Congresswoman Kilpatrick.

1155
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,840
 Thank you, Madam Chair.

1156
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,200
 I think I want to start first with Mr. Pernati,

1157
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,900
 if I'm pronouncing that correctly.

1158
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,400
 Is the Vatican included in Italy's deception?

1159
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,200
 I know they're separate unto the country.

1160
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,280
 Do you interact with them?

1161
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,680
 Do they have their own beliefs about what this phenomenon is?

1162
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,840
 Yes.

1163
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:53,880
 Consider that recently, even the official term

1164
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,280
 unidentified flying objects was formally translated

1165
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:03,400
 into Latin, res inexplicate volantes,

1166
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:08,400
 which means exactly the same thing in the old Latin tongue.

1167
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,880
 This was made surely because there

1168
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,200
 is a definite approach in the Vatican.

1169
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,440
 And according to my personal opinion

1170
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:25,160
 and to what I happened to see, well, everything

1171
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,920
 began probably in 1952.

1172
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,840
 Mr. Pernati.

1173
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,360
 Yes.

1174
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,760
 I've got five minutes.

1175
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,280
 You've got 1 and 1/2 minutes.

1176
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,960
 Let me ask, my question, my only question right now.

1177
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,120
 We're going to come back.

1178
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,160
 In 1952, we had--

1179
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,000
 No, sorry, I mean, wait, you have to wait a minute.

1180
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,600
 OK, OK.

1181
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,560
 No, I just want to ask the question.

1182
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,560
 I'm not trying to be rude.

1183
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,680
 Help me out, Madam Chair, because I want to get all of them

1184
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,800
 on one question.

1185
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,400
 And I'm just trying to find-- we had 10 different countries

1186
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,800
 today, 11 counting Russia and 12 if we count Vatican.

1187
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,760
 So what I was trying to--

1188
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,120
 The Vatican is absolutely open to this subject

1189
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,720
 because recently, the director of Specula Vaticana,

1190
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,920
 which is the official astronomical observatory

1191
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,320
 of the Vatican, said not only that surely UFOs exist,

1192
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,000
 but they have to exist because otherwise, this

1193
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,920
 would be contradictory to the doctrine of the church,

1194
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,480
 of the creation of the power of God's creation.

1195
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:26,480
 In other words, we have to meet in the future aliens,

1196
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,640
 and we must consider them as our brothers.

1197
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,080
 This is exactly what the official Vatican paper wrote.

1198
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,520
 OK, thank you, Mr. Pananti.

1199
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,560
 Thank you very much, sir.

1200
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,320
 I appreciate that.

1201
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,200
 I'm still not sure if it's one or two thoughts,

1202
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,560
 but I agree with what you said.

1203
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,720
 Thank you very much.

1204
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,280
 For all of you and all of your experiences,

1205
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,800
 and I appreciate all your testimony.

1206
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,120
 Again, we've heard from 12 different countries today,

1207
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,920
 and that's just an international phenomenon.

1208
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,720
 One question I want to ask, do any of your countries

1209
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,640
 have any relationship with the United States government,

1210
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,960
 any NGOs here, or any nonprofits,

1211
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,760
 where they would get all of your information

1212
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,880
 or some of your information or come and get whatever you got?

1213
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,760
 Do you interact with the United States on this,

1214
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,240
 and do they have some of the materials

1215
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,240
 that you have collected over the years?

1216
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,080
 Let me start with you, Mr. Hucsini.

1217
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,800
 Well, the answer is I'm just reporting

1218
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,480
 on the history of France and Russia,

1219
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,800
 but I'm not their spokesman.

1220
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,080
 If you don't know, it's OK.

1221
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,200
 You can say that, too.

1222
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,120
 So I wouldn't know.

1223
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,560
 I would imagine that the Russians and the Americans

1224
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,840
 have some dialogue on this, but that's an assumption.

1225
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,680
 But no, to your knowledge, nothing

1226
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,200
 where Russia may have had an incident,

1227
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,800
 and the US came and got some of their--

1228
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,560
 Well, I mean, even from that clause of the nuclear thing,

1229
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,800
 you know, I mean, I think there's

1230
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,320
 some incidents where they must have some connections,

1231
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,600
 but it certainly wouldn't be public.

1232
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,280
 The French, as you know, from your days in Congress,

1233
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,400
 are pretty independent on their way of thinking.

1234
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,640
 And friends with friends, cousins, actually.

1235
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,280
 Yeah, I know we're allies, but--

1236
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,440
 Right, allies is a word.

1237
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,280
 Allies, but they're a little independent.

1238
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,720
 So I don't think they would--

1239
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,480
 OK, and I don't want anybody to speculate.

1240
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,640
 It's OK to say if you don't know, you don't know.

1241
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,320
 No, I don't know.

1242
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,360
 OK, but that's good enough.

1243
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,520
 And you're right about the relationships

1244
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,240
 to our countries.

1245
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:09,840
 You're absolutely right.

1246
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,520
 Thank you very much.

1247
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,480
 Mr. Paul.

1248
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,680
 Ma'am, there was some limited liaison

1249
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,200
 between the USAAF Project Blue Book and the Ministry

1250
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,800
 of Defense right up until Blue Book was terminated.

1251
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,520
 Beyond that, I'm not aware of anything other than ad hoc

1252
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,520
 liaison.

1253
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,000
 Our terms of reference limited our investigations

1254
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,160
 to the UK's air defense region.

1255
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,000
 But we did, from time to time, through the embassies

1256
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,840
 and open source, IE media, get reports from other countries.

1257
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,160
 Did British government, US government,

1258
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,720
 or an NGO in America, or a nonprofit in America,

1259
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,280
 ever come to Britain and take some of the findings,

1260
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:52,160
 or oversee, or analyze any findings from your country?

1261
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,200
 I believe that some files were exchanged.

1262
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:55,880
 Yes, ma'am.

1263
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,840
 And I think that some of the Blue Book personnel

1264
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,080
 made the odd visit.

1265
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,040
 And indeed, you heard the testimony of General Gabrielle,

1266
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,960
 of course, coming in and taking items relating to Rendlesham.

1267
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,840
 OK, thank you very much.

1268
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,880
 Mr. Cameron, in Canada.

1269
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,480
 The Canadians, since 1954, have been completely

1270
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,400
 silent on the subject.

1271
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,280
 But I would imagine, based on the very close relationship

1272
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,160
 between Canada and the United States,

1273
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,640
 especially with regards to NATO, that discussions

1274
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,080
 are taking place at some level, interacting material.

1275
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,120
 But the Canadians are absolutely quiet.

1276
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,240
 They do not say anything.

1277
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,240
 The American government leaks a lot of material.

1278
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,520
 The Canadian governments have said nothing since 1954.

1279
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,480
 OK, unlike what we heard this morning,

1280
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,400
 US, in some instances, actually went to those countries

1281
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,200
 and gathered the particles, the information.

1282
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,160
 Yeah, I have a story.

1283
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,880
 My father worked for the Department of Transport.

1284
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,760
 No, hold the story.

1285
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,240
 Hold the story.

1286
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:49,800
 I got one minute.

1287
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,880
 OK, it's a good story, though.

1288
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,200
 I know.

1289
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,840
 We'll come back for it, second round, I promise.

1290
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,720
 I'll give it to you.

1291
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,960
 Mr. Shelley, would you comment on that, China and the US?

1292
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,000
 Does China share anything with our government,

1293
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,440
 with an NGO in America, or a nonprofit

1294
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,040
 as it relates to your findings?

1295
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,800
 And I love your testimony, by the way.

1296
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,000
 500 years and up, that's outstanding and still standing,

1297
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,240
 and the economic engine of the world.

1298
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,320
 Tell me, does China share on this phenomenon,

1299
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,920
 on the extraterrestrial UFO phenomenon with the US at all?

1300
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:30,280
 Well, on this, we have some exchanges

1301
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:34,560
 in the non-governmental area, for example,

1302
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,280
 with the Rockefeller Foundation.

1303
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,640
 Several times, they have come to me,

1304
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,440
 and we have conducted a high-level,

1305
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:54,240
 a trilateral meeting that involves Americans, Russians,

1306
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,360
 and Chinese on the UFO issue.

1307
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,440
 We, at the meeting, talked about the fact

1308
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,280
 that we have to take actions and do more research in this area.

1309
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,400
 And suggestions were made at that meeting

1310
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,520
 to have a summit meeting.

1311
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:17,280
 And I was asked to start preparing for this summit

1312
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:17,800
 meeting.

1313
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,080
 So for more than 10 years, I have

1314
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:28,920
 been trying to make efforts and start this summit.

1315
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:33,480
 I have been preparing for this summit meeting on UFO.

1316
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:40,520
 And this time, the Rockefeller Foundation

1317
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,600
 hosted this meeting.

1318
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:49,360
 They also invited me to Princeton University.

1319
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,760
 One of the deans there met with me.

1320
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,800
 And he promised me that he will try

1321
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:05,920
 to organize a very high-level scientist group to do research.

1322
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:16,080
 And they will make an exception and take a Chinese person

1323
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:21,160
 to join this group, to join this expert or this scientist group.

1324
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:28,080
 And once the scientific research results in China

1325
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,800
 have been acknowledged by this group, it will be published.

1326
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,320
 And it will be acknowledged around the world.

1327
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:39,760
 Nowadays, we have many results at hand.

1328
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,200
 We are trying to verify those results

1329
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:50,120
 and exchange those information with other organizations.

1330
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:58,440
 So in my opinion, our next step is to become more active.

1331
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:04,080
 So like me, I am the chairman of the Chinese UFO Federation.

1332
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:10,560
 Our work is not only to find out where those UFOs are,

1333
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,760
 we also have to focus on the next step that

1334
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,440
 is the high technology that is from outer space.

1335
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,400
 Thank you very much.

1336
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,520
 Thanks to all the panelists.

1337
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,000
 Thank you.

1338
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,080
 [APPLAUSE]

1339
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:22,560
 Thank you.

1340
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:37,320
 Mr. Penati, would you give us some actual examples

1341
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:43,520
 and experiences that you learned and experienced

1342
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:52,440
 during your many years and total involvement with these issues?

1343
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:57,480
 My experience is both of private nature

1344
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:02,440
 and also from the standpoint of officiality,

1345
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,360
 because I could consult also the Italian Air Force Archives.

1346
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,240
 OK, excuse me.

1347
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:08,800
 Yes.

1348
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,040
 Let's make sure-- let's talk about what--

1349
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:12,640
 Some examples.

1350
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,680
 --with UFOs or--

1351
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,160
 Yes, yes.

1352
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:16,680
 --ETs.

1353
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,320
 OK, thank you.

1354
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,160
 Exactly, I understand.

1355
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:22,120
 For instance, just to make some examples,

1356
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:27,560
 we could mention-- this could be linked to the previous question

1357
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,520
 too.

1358
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:33,280
 For instance, in 1954, we had a big wave in Italy.

1359
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,560
 And even the ambassador of the United States in Rome

1360
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,640
 was present at one of these phenomena, for instance.

1361
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:48,680
 In 1978, we had the biggest wave, more than 2,000 cases.

1362
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:54,280
 And in these cases, we had absolutely the landing,

1363
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:58,320
 the sightings, rather cases of objects.

1364
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,800
 They were round objects with dome.

1365
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:09,160
 And in different cases, we had also antities on the ground.

1366
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:14,520
 There are both close encounters of the second kind cases

1367
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,720
 and also of this type.

1368
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:22,000
 What we may say is that there is a definite pattern.

1369
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,120
 In other words, in many cases, we

1370
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:28,960
 see the same kind of event, a definite craft

1371
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,920
 of a certain shape, a couple of occupants,

1372
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:41,080
 and a lot of phenomena which may be related among them.

1373
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,560
 Besides, for instance, the Italian Air Force

1374
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:50,800
 in different occasions had really the close encounters

1375
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:56,280
 with fighters and UFOs in the skies of Italy,

1376
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:01,680
 since 1966 to 1978, for instance.

1377
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,840
 There is also a photograph of one of these objects

1378
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:13,160
 made by a Fiat G91 fighter Italian plane.

1379
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:17,840
 In other words, we have a lot of materials in this 400 cases

1380
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,240
 filed in the Italian Air Force archives,

1381
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,560
 not only UFOs in the real sense of the word,

1382
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,280
 but also unidentified submerged objects, too.

1383
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,520
 Because don't forget that UFOs do not

1384
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,440
 fly in the real sense of the word,

1385
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:41,320
 but they may also interact with the hydrosphere.

1386
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,520
 And Italy has five seas.

1387
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,080
 And so there are many, many cases

1388
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,680
 in which these objects entered the water

1389
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,280
 and took off from the water.

1390
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,840
 There are even official photographs

1391
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,720
 of these cases in our country.

1392
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,240
 Thank you so much.

1393
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,800
 Thank you.

1394
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:07,400
 Mr. Pope, you say that in 2007, the MOD made a policy decision

1395
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:13,280
 to declassify and release its entire archive of UFO files.

1396
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,200
 How did the public respond?

1397
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,840
 How did the government respond?

1398
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,840
 How did the press respond?

1399
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,080
 There was extensive media interest, Congresswoman,

1400
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:29,000
 and huge public interest, too, as a result.

1401
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,080
 On the website, for example, the National Archives website--

1402
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,920
 I don't have the statistics in front of me,

1403
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,480
 but it was hundreds of thousands of hits, if not more.

1404
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:42,600
 And were the responses positive, or did they make fun of it?

1405
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,680
 A bit of both, ma'am.

1406
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,640
 I think some people were incredibly interested.

1407
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,600
 Some people were concerned that taxpayers' money

1408
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,160
 had been spent on this at all.

1409
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,760
 And some people thought that the whole thing was disinformation

1410
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,320
 and all the good stuff was being kept back.

1411
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,560
 OK, thank you very much.

1412
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,640
 I yield my time.

1413
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,880
 Thank you.

1414
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,600
 Next, we have Representative Bartlett.

1415
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,080
 I didn't know your name.

1416
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,640
 [LAUGHTER]

1417
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,880
 Is there a global website that people can go to,

1418
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,320
 or do you have to go to a lot of individual ones?

1419
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,760
 There's no master link that can tie you into all this stuff?

1420
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,560
 OK, thank you.

1421
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,880
 Mr. Panetti, you mentioned you investigated Roswell.

1422
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,440
 What does that mean, and what did you conclude?

1423
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,920
 Simply, I was here in the States in 1991

1424
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:39,040
 when these cases were absolutely not known like today.

1425
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,560
 And I succeeded, when they were still alive,

1426
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,440
 to contact some of the witnesses.

1427
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,800
 For instance, the former lieutenant Hoth,

1428
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,360
 just to make an example.

1429
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,880
 And other people, Dennis Stacey and so on.

1430
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,920
 Besides, there were other links.

1431
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:01,120
 You surely know the case of Colonel Philip Corso

1432
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,320
 and all the story.

1433
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,640
 And what did you conclude?

1434
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,920
 What was your conclusion?

1435
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:05,640
 No.

1436
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,000
 My personal conclusion is that the case is absolutely true.

1437
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,040
 Besides, I have also a personal--

1438
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:11,960
 What's true?

1439
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:12,440
 No, no.

1440
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,400
 That it was a balloon?

1441
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:13,960
 Is that what's true?

1442
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:14,840
 No, no, absolutely.

1443
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,920
 That we were facing an extraterrestrial spaceship.

1444
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:19,320
 OK.

1445
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,920
 Besides, a very interesting thing is this.

1446
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,680
 When I was a military in 1971 and '72,

1447
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:31,120
 and I was in Italy for the Netto Third Mysill Brigade,

1448
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,440
 I had a uniform, of course.

1449
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,960
 And on that occasion, I was ordered

1450
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,680
 to prepare a lecture for my unit.

1451
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,600
 And I did.

1452
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:46,600
 Well, I was in touch also with an American artillery captain,

1453
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,880
 because in that period, of course, in Netto,

1454
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,400
 we were all together.

1455
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,640
 And he came and told me, oh, Lieutenant Pinotti,

1456
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,160
 I know you are preparing this interesting lecture.

1457
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,680
 OK.

1458
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:04,000
 You know, in the USA, we have the crashed objects,

1459
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
 and even the corpses of the pilots.

1460
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,880
 Well, you can understand that in 1971 and 1972,

1461
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,480
 we knew that all this were rubbish,

1462
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,960
 that all this did not exist.

1463
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,680
 Only the Scully cases were known and was

1464
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,880
 considered not in a positive way.

1465
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,680
 So frankly, at that time, I thought

1466
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,000
 that this guy was out of mind.

1467
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
 Frankly, today, I do not know.

1468
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:36,720
 Thank you.

1469
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:40,440
 Mr. Schille, you said that a cover-up was unacceptable.

1470
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,480
 Unacceptable to your organization?

1471
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,080
 Unacceptable to your government?

1472
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,920
 Unacceptable to your military?

1473
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,400
 Which?

1474
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:51,640
 Does your government consider cover-up unacceptable?

1475
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,600
 Right.

1476
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,080
 It's unacceptable.

1477
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:03,560
 But now, looking at what the Chinese government thinks,

1478
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,200
 I don't think they're exactly there yet,

1479
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,920
 because the Chinese government doesn't

1480
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:14,560
 have as much information on ET as that held by the US

1481
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:20,320
 government, such as the remains of these ETs and so on.

1482
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:29,680
 But I can also tell you this, on the issue of UFO

1483
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:34,040
 or flying objects, the Chinese government

1484
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,080
 is still very interested.

1485
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,800
 We have a commander for the Air Force.

1486
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:46,880
 Before that person takes office, they would often come to me

1487
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,000
 and talk to me before they take office.

1488
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,360
 And also, a lot of people in the Air Force come talk to us

1489
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,320
 and say that, oh, UFO is a big issue.

1490
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,840
 We have to go talk to you.

1491
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:04,280
 We have to talk to the Chinese UFO Federation.

1492
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:09,920
 So all in all, in China, the people in the government

1493
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,640
 see this as a military issue, a security issue,

1494
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:21,040
 which is not entirely the same as our approach.

1495
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,560
 So the government is not trying to cover up anything.

1496
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,120
 But they see this as still confidential,

1497
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,720
 because they think this is a national security

1498
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,360
 and a military issue.

1499
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,680
 We have some examples here.

1500
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:41,380
 We have been notified some sightings by the government.

1501
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:44,600
 And they seek our suggestions and opinions sometimes.

1502
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,880
 Thank you very much.

1503
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,560
 Thank you, thank you.

1504
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,880
 Mr. Cameron.

1505
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,800
 Excuse me, you have 30 seconds.

1506
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,400
 30 seconds.

1507
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,200
 I saw the sign.

1508
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,240
 I have a good eyesight.

1509
01:21:53,240 --> 01:22:00,720
 Someone might say of a girl that she has tons of lipstick on.

1510
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,400
 Now, there's tons of material that the United States

1511
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,280
 is supposed to have.

1512
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,560
 Is that figurative or literal?

1513
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,960
 I think both.

1514
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,800
 Figurative.

1515
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,120
 When I asked the medallurgist how much they handled,

1516
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,440
 he just said tons of it.

1517
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,200
 I mean, they had to handle a lot of material.

1518
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,000
 Did he mean like tons of lipstick or literal tons of stuff?

1519
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,520
 His son tells numerous stories about seeing boxes,

1520
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:26,480
 cars coming, military cars delivering material.

1521
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,800
 There's a lot of discussion about material

1522
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,920
 coming to Wilbur Smith for analysis in Canada.

1523
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,120
 The sign says my time is up.

1524
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,760
 Another round, thanks.

1525
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,320
 Thank you.

1526
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:42,880
 Let me ask each of you to be very brief.

1527
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:50,520
 But I want to know how many of the sightings of what

1528
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:59,800
 you know about vehicles, saucers, whatever you want to call them,

1529
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,280
 how many of those are unmanned versus manned?

1530
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,240
 Do you know?

1531
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:10,280
 I mean, is there sort of a ratio or most of these

1532
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:14,240
 without somebody so-called driving it?

1533
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:18,160
 Because that's how far my imagination goes.

1534
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:21,120
 That's a really good question.

1535
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,520
 We don't know.

1536
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:28,960
 Because Dr. Heineck, who was the famous advisor for Blue Book,

1537
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,240
 who later became very pro-euphology,

1538
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,480
 well, he came up with the term close encounters

1539
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,320
 of the third kind for those cases where, besides the UFO,

1540
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,920
 occupants were seen.

1541
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,800
 This could be that sometimes if you are close enough to the object,

1542
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,680
 you may even see an occupant inside the porthole or something.

1543
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:51,520
 Or maybe the object landed and the occupant came out.

1544
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,000
 But in other cases when the object is at a distance, which

1545
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,240
 is the majority of UFO sightings, we would have no way of knowing

1546
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:02,600
 if it's automatically piloted or not.

1547
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:08,040
 Then we have cases where we have large objects, which obviously

1548
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,280
 must be manned by someone.

1549
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:15,800
 And then out of the large object, small little probes come.

1550
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,280
 And those seem to be remotely piloted vehicles,

1551
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:24,720
 kind of early versions of what today we call drones.

1552
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,920
 But these are reported as far back as the '50s or something

1553
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,800
 when certainly the Americans or the Russians or whatever

1554
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,360
 did not have access to this kind of technology.

1555
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,120
 I mean, this whole thing about unmanned vehicles

1556
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,200
 is fairly recent.

1557
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,640
 I think it goes back to maybe the '70s for the first.

1558
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,640
 So there is no way of knowing.

1559
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:48,640
 But certainly there is a percentage

1560
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,320
 that do have occupants.

1561
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,440
 But the exact statistics, because of the distances,

1562
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,520
 there's no way of knowing.

1563
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,480
 Nick, do you have anything to add?

1564
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:03,160
 Madam Chair, of the roundabout 12,000 UFO reports

1565
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,840
 that MOD received in the time of the UFO project,

1566
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:11,360
 only perhaps a few dozen involve the sighting of any entities.

1567
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,040
 OK, Mr. Cameron?

1568
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,680
 I have a personal bias that sightings are

1569
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,040
 almost a total waste of time.

1570
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,960
 You can't tell anything from stuff flying around in the sky.

1571
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,520
 It's not until you interact with whoever is flying them

1572
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,600
 or get inside the ship that you can learn anything.

1573
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,440
 You really can't determine very much

1574
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,080
 from watching whether it's their stuff, their stuff.

1575
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,040
 It's just stuff flying around in the sky.

1576
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,240
 It just shows you that something very mysterious is going on.

1577
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,360
 Thank you.

1578
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:37,840
 Mr. Shelley?

1579
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:49,680
 There is a higher level Air Force official

1580
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,800
 that he gave me a UFO report.

1581
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:56,840
 He reported that he has seen that dozens of UFOs

1582
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:00,040
 that have lined up and are flying in the same direction.

1583
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:08,320
 And he said that there must be a highly intelligent organism

1584
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,400
 in there to fly in that.

1585
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,480
 So I think this is a very valuable report,

1586
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,920
 because it reported by the high level military officials.

1587
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,560
 Because ordinary people do not have

1588
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:21,000
 that kind of knowledge about aerospace.

1589
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,280
 But this official, the military officers,

1590
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:28,280
 that he considered this must be evidence

1591
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:33,440
 of there's a high intelligence organisms flying the objects.

1592
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:37,040
 And so in this high level military officers,

1593
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:41,720
 he often joined and participated in our seminars as well.

1594
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:46,600
 And he even gave me a picture of the UFO.

1595
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,760
 This is something very special.

1596
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,840
 That was a picture that's taken from the satellite.

1597
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,300
 And that was very clear, crisp, clear picture of a UFO.

1598
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:56,800
 Thank you.

1599
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,960
 In my personal opinion, I consider

1600
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,840
 that there is a big difference between the official cases

1601
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:04,960
 and the civilian cases.

1602
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,120
 For instance, in Italy, we have more than 12,000 cases

1603
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,680
 taken from civilian sources.

1604
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,080
 And the Italian Air Force, only 400.

1605
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,840
 So this is a big difference.

1606
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:22,280
 But just to make my possible opinion,

1607
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:27,680
 I frankly think that we are facing some elongated and very

1608
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:36,040
 big motherships which may contain piloted objects.

1609
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,720
 And these piloted objects are not

1610
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:42,040
 too different from our fighters, in other words.

1611
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:46,840
 And then probably there are also remotely piloted probes.

1612
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:55,280
 And they are probably objects no more than half a meter

1613
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:59,240
 in diameter of dimension, this is.

1614
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,000
 But they are probably able to fly

1615
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,560
 and to give information to this strange phenomena.

1616
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,600
 All right.

1617
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:14,440
 Thank you very much for your time and your testimony.

1618
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,200
 It was a terrific panel.

1619
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:16,800
 Thank you.

1620
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,760
 And we are adjourned until 3:30.

1621
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,800
