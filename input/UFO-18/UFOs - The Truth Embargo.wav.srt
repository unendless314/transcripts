1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
 Excuse me. We need to start with the oath. Would you please swear in the witness?

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,520
 Ms. Howe and gentlemen, if you would please stand and repeat after me.

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,460
 I do hereby affirm. I do hereby affirm.

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,120
 That I will tell the truth. That I will tell the truth.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,940
 And nothing but the truth. And nothing but the truth.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,500
 To this committee today.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 To this committee today.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 Thank you.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,160
 Yes, and this is what's been -- well, this is, as I understand it, the truth embargo

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,200
 panel. Is that a fair statement of this panel?

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
 Yes.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
 Great. And a film, as I understand it?

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 Yes.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:01:03,960
 Yes. Well, as we get older and older, I'm 77 right now. You can't live forever, you

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:17,320
 know. So if this procedure I'm going to have to clean the blood doesn't work, then I've

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:27,200
 got probably a few more months to make it before my kidneys shut down. So that's kind

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,480
 of why I'm kind of going along with the interview at this time.

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,240
 You're seeing that what you went through is just too important for people not to know

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
 about.

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
 Yeah.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:48,720
 Can you just -- can we start at the beginning with your military career and just walk through

22
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
 what exactly your experiences were?

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:02:02,480
 I was drafted into the military and got into the U.S. Army. After that, I was sent to the

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,920
 Signal Training Center in eastern United States.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
 What year would this be?

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:18,760
 1958. I went through the signal training course. And at that time, I went through the radio

27
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:29,320
 tele-type course and also the cryptography course, Crypto. They had five instructors

28
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:38,360
 that were getting out of military service, so they pulled the top five students. And

29
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,560
 I was third in the class, so I got pulled as an instructor.

30
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,920
 Now, were you at this time also working yet for CIA?

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
 No.

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
 Not yet?

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:03:00,480
 No. After one day, my boss came to me and he said, "How would you like to, you know,

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:09,200
 make some extra money?" And I said, "Well, money is good." So he explained to me that

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:17,140
 I could -- he could put it through, like, would have to get a top secret White House

36
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:25,840
 cue clearance for the job, you know. And I thought, boy, must be a pretty exclusive thing,

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,560
 you know. And I said, "Well, what is this?" And he said that I'm director for the CIA

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,200
 for eastern United States, you know. And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that." And he said,

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,640
 "You weren't supposed to."

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:52,480
 After about six weeks, my security clearance came through, and I got my CIA card. It was

41
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,360
 an ID card, like a credit card, where I could just go up to the door and slice it, walk

42
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:09,200
 right in. And my name at that time, I used an artificial name, too. Never used my real

43
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:21,360
 name. I started working with him on the project he was on. And that was Project Blue Book,

44
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,440
 which was kind of partially a fraud.

45
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,520
 You're saying some of the Blue Book cases were completely fictitious?

46
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:40,920
 Yes. But the cases that we got came from, I think it was Fort Belleville, Maryland.

47
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
 Fort Belvoir?

48
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:50,400
 Yeah. And it didn't come from the Pentagon, or it didn't come from CIA headquarters. But

49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:59,440
 we would get reports about a certain sighting that they had in Mexico or Italy or something

50
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:07,920
 like that. And then we had people that would follow through on it, that would go out and

51
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,880
 interview the people to see if they were not cases, or if it was real, you know.

52
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,560
 So you'd be going overseas frequently?

53
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:26,920
 I wasn't, but I always stayed statewide. But the people we had working with us from

54
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:37,440
 CIA would do that. We would get like a new report probably a couple times a week. I was

55
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,080
 coming into the Army fresh off the farm, you know, so I really didn't have much knowledge

56
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:53,360
 of anything. But my boss filled me in on Project Blue Book and what they had found so far,

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:01,320
 as far as the Greys and the aliens and the Roswell Incident.

58
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,840
 How did you feel when this first got dumped on you? When you first learned about this?

59
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,840
 I was just kind of overwhelmed with all of this, you know. And I said to him, I don't

60
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,520
 know if I'm going to be able to be a judge of this type of thing. What's real, what's

61
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,320
 not, when I don't have much knowledge of it, you know.

62
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,080
 So what did he say?

63
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:36,960
 He said, well, we have to build the information as we go and you'll see how this thing is

64
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
 working out.

65
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,080
 And then the other thing is, of course, you really weren't able to tell family or close

66
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
 friends, obviously.

67
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:52,760
 No, I couldn't tell anybody. In fact, I had to take a vow that I wouldn't tell anybody,

68
00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:04,480
 a lot of it for 40 years and more of it for 50 years, which is up in 2010.

69
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,360
 You're doing all this crypto work. You're looking at images, photographs, video. It's

70
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,720
 1958, maybe the fall of '58. What happened after this?

71
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,520
 At that time, the Project Blue Book thing kind of went pot, you know. If you remember,

72
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,920
 back in those days, they kind of declared it as a nothing, you know.

73
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:38,000
 And they were telling the world, all UFOs are misidentifications, hoaxes, psychological

74
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,040
 issues, whatever.

75
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:48,640
 Yes. So my boss came to me and he says, we've both got a new assignment. And he says, oh,

76
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:56,240
 I said, where are we going? Oh, he says, we're going to the Capitol. We're going to be part

77
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:06,960
 of the Eisenhower push. He's trying to find out something about, all about these aliens

78
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:15,880
 that MJ-12 was supposed to find out, but never sent back reports to him.

79
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:22,440
 The MJ-12, the UFO control group, were they calling it MJ-12 at that time?

80
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
 Yes.

81
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:33,480
 They called us in, went into the Oval Office, and President Eisenhower was there in Nixon,

82
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:46,960
 and they said, we called the people in from MJ-12, from Area 51 and S-4, but they told

83
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:54,960
 us that the government had no jurisdiction over what they were doing. So being a general,

84
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:03,920
 past general, you didn't tell them to go to hell without any real good reason, you know.

85
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:14,120
 So he said, I want you and your boss to fly out there. I want you to give them a personal

86
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:23,640
 message. He says, I want you to tell them, whoever is in charge, tell them that to get

87
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:31,760
 in, they have this week, coming week, to get into Washington and to report to me. And if

88
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,040
 they don't, I'm going to get the 1st Army from Colorado, and we're going to go over,

89
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,080
 we're going to take the base over, I don't care what kind of classified material you

90
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,560
 got, we're going to rip this thing apart.

91
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:56,120
 Eisenhower was going to invade Area 51, yeah, with the 1st Army.

92
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,800
 So you go out with your superior, you fly out, you land, what happens? Can you describe

93
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,680
 this whole process, what you saw?

94
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:16,800
 It took us the 13 or 15 miles south to S4, had like different garage door openings. And

95
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,840
 in these garage door openings, they had like different saucer crafts. The very first one

96
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:39,920
 had the Roswell craft in. It was kind of crashed up, but apparently every alien that was in

97
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
 it died except for a couple.

98
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,880
 So you see the Roswell craft, and what are some of the others that you see?

99
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:53,440
 Well, the Roswell craft was really strange, because it looked like real heavy aluminum

100
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:04,880
 foil. We could rock next to it, and you could rock, the whole thing probably weighed 150,

101
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
 300 pounds.

102
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,280
 Could they tell what the source of power was of this craft?

103
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:21,840
 Yeah, it was like a river's gravitational thing of some kind. In fact, one, later on,

104
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:35,040
 I got the mathematical code for recursing gravity in a 3x5 card. I guess there are different

105
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,880
 types of grays and so on.

106
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
 How did you see that evidence?

107
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:55,200
 Well, later on at S4, we viewed the autopsy film. And then the colonel said, "What we've

108
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,040
 got in here is we're interviewing a gray alien."

109
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,400
 All right, right there. How did you feel at that moment?

110
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:14,480
 Well, I thought, boy, we had no idea we were going to see the real thing. All we saw was

111
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
 film.

112
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,360
 You had to have a little bit of heart racing at that moment.

113
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,600
 Yes. My boss was able to go in and had a partial interview with him.

114
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,280
 So what did this gray alien look like? Could you describe him a little bit?

115
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,360
 This one looked a little bit oriental.

116
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,200
 So I'm just wondering, if it looked almost human, what about this didn't look human?

117
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:52,320
 No, it didn't look human as far as the skin tone and basically the shape of it and the

118
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
 size.

119
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,480
 How was its head size compared with a normal human, for example?

120
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:07,080
 One was kind of a little bit bigger and some of them noses were very, very small and ears

121
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:14,640
 were just like holes. Mouth was very small.

122
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,200
 Why were they bringing you out here at all anyway to see an alien? What was the point?

123
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,620
 To go back and tell the president they actually had one.

124
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,040
 So he did not know at this point if there was an alien at S4.

125
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,840
 What did you do then? Were you done or did you have other things to do at S4?

126
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,160
 Yes, basically we were kind of done. We went back to Area 51. They took us into the main

127
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:57,120
 building and there we saw a U-2 which of course we didn't know existed and a model of the

128
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
 SR-71.

129
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
 The Blackbird.

130
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:09,680
 But like I mentioned earlier, it was not a model of the current Blackbird, but an early

131
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
 version.

132
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,280
 Did you go directly to Washington after this or did you go somewhere else? Did you fly

133
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,680
 regular airline?

134
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:28,400
 We flew back to the commuter plane, back to the air base and then took President Eisenhower's

135
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,600
 Lockheed Electra back to Washington.

136
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,960
 You and your supervisor, superior officer, and now you're meeting with the president?

137
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,160
 Yes.

138
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:56,280
 We met with him in the second story of the old OSS warehouse building. Eisenhower and

139
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:07,520
 Nixon were there and also Hoover was there. So he asked us what was going on and we told

140
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:17,840
 him about the alien and the whole situation and the black projects and so on. He was just

141
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:28,880
 totally shocked. He appeared for the first time to be worried, like he was worried.

142
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,080
 I would think that Eisenhower would, I mean he certainly knew that flying saucers were

143
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
 real.

144
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
 Yes.

145
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:47,640
 They were aliens. So I guess I'm just wondering what would he have been really surprised about?

146
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:54,680
 Surprised about the black programs. Eisenhower said, "I've got to keep this thing completely

147
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,480
 secret. I can't talk about this."

148
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,280
 Your actual name, the name you grew up with, that was a different name than what you had

149
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
 in the...

150
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,840
 I never used it in the CIA at all.

151
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:19,120
 Now what about today? You're going on the public record and this is still sensitive

152
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,920
 information even though earlier you talked about security oaths that maybe expire after

153
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
 a certain period of time.

154
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
 50 years.

155
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
 But you're still concerned.

156
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:38,040
 I had a Linda Motenhouse phone call. Her phone was tapped and they got my phone number and

157
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:45,280
 through the telephone company they were able to find me and so on.

158
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,840
 When they found you, what happened?

159
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:55,120
 I was going to a grocery store. Two guys in black suits came out of a black Lincoln town

160
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:05,200
 car and came over to see me and they told me that I better not publish anything or talk

161
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:15,800
 to Linda about any more things. So at that time, I did. I stopped.

162
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,840
 That was enough to intimidate you.

163
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:25,600
 I'd rather remain anonymous. Never show my face on anything.

164
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,640
 Really thank you for doing this.

165
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:38,240
 Yes. This was, I guess, kind of a good idea because I feel much better having talked about

166
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,240
 it. I kind of feel like there's a load off my shoulders.

167
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
 Really?

168
00:17:46,240 --> 00:18:02,800
 Yes. Because I had an awful lot of secrets that I had kept over the years.

169
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:18,480
 I'd like to now hear from Linda Motenhouse. Go ahead. You've got 10 minutes.

170
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,480
 In the summer of 1994, I spent three days and three nights in that gentleman's home.

171
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:32,120
 No one on the planet knew where I was, not my family, not anyone.

172
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:41,400
 I recorded 11 90-minute audiotapes with him. I knew that I was in the presence of somebody

173
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:51,640
 who was telling the truth to the best of his ability and that the military cover of levels

174
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,520
 of intelligence in this country has been used for a very long time. On the surface, he was

175
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:05,480
 a cryptologist working in the United States Army, but as he described in the film, he

176
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,440
 took on a role, highly classified, working for the CIA, and his boss was reporting to

177
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,520
 Langley from reports that were coming into Fort Belvoir. He described to me in great

178
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:27,120
 detail the autopsy footage that he had seen of nonhumans describing the unusual brains

179
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,440
 and the unusual internal organs, and the fact that they were screening film disguised as

180
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,240
 being on a southeastern military base, and that the film that they were screening on

181
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,920
 a regular basis was coming from around the world. He had seen film from Italy in which

182
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:51,120
 nonhumans were outside of a craft, and the film had been taken from a nearby peak in

183
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:58,040
 a mountain. He talked about Area 51 from his first-hand experience of being there on the

184
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:04,520
 other side of what would be a one-way mirror while his boss from Langley was inside with

185
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,840
 a nonhuman, and that he himself had seen some of the craft, like a museum that's inside

186
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:21,600
 of Papoose Mountain. After those three days and three nights where no one knew where I was,

187
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,240
 I left to do something that would be normal in the normal nine-to-five world, and when

188
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:36,440
 I returned to my home then in Philadelphia, I remember going to the phone and voicemail,

189
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:43,520
 and the last thing that we had agreed upon was that I would return in approximately four

190
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:54,000
 weeks with a video crew in which I was preparing a statement for him and for me to sign that

191
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,980
 I would do a videotape interview like my 11 audio tapes, and I would hold it until after

192
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:08,120
 his death. He thought that he was not going to live very long in '94. So I was surprised

193
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:15,880
 to hear his voice on my voicemail say, "Linda, my wife and I went to the supermarket after

194
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,160
 you left, and two men were leaning against our car when we came out of the supermarket,

195
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,880
 and they said, 'We want to remind you that you have been a loyal American, and we are

196
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,420
 here to tell you that you are never to talk with Linda Moulton Howe again or to discuss

197
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:42,180
 this subject.'" None of those 11 hours of my audio tapes would have been in the phone

198
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:48,800
 calls, so it means that they were listening to our three days and three nights in the

199
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:57,320
 house, and I promised him from that point on that I would never discuss him or the material,

200
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,640
 and in fact, later on, I received information from someone unknown that he was dead. So

201
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:12,280
 I am personally gratified to see that he made a statement today for this citizen hearing

202
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:20,760
 because he is scratching the surface of how complex this is and how military and intel

203
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,760
 people have been intimidated for not only their whole careers but their whole lives.

204
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,400
 To never tell the truth about something so fundamental as we are not alone in this universe,

205
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,720
 that nonhumans have been interacting with this planet for millennia, and you have just

206
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:46,720
 heard from one of the firsthand. I had placed before you a prepared statement concerning

207
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:54,760
 truth embargo and a whole other experience that I had in Kirtland Air Force Base in 1983

208
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:02,560
 that would have been a decade before being able to talk with this man. I hope that you

209
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,220
 will read it in its entirety. I know I don't have time this morning to go through it, but

210
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:16,200
 I can summarize that blocking truth, that we're calling the truth embargo, has been

211
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,960
 the intent of the American government's official policy of denial since 1947 when the President

212
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,480
 Truman administration decided that all information about nonhuman intelligences interacting with

213
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,400
 this planet should be kept from the public and media, and that includes Congress and

214
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,800
 the Supreme Court and all machinery of our government except for those designated as

215
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:47,680
 having "a need to know" and the pro words and the numbers that have gone with the few

216
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:55,800
 people who have had total access in MJ-12. I encountered truth embargoes repeatedly as

217
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,400
 I investigated the bloodless, trackless animal mutilations in Colorado and the surrounding

218
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,720
 region from my TV documentary special, A Strange Harvest, beginning in September of 1979, and

219
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,240
 I have provided for you a letter from United States Senator Harrison Schmidt, dated March

220
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:25,480
 14, 1979. It is attached to my statement. It was a letter that Apollo astronaut and

221
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,480
 then US Senator Harrison Schmidt of New Mexico had sent to constituents announcing a conference

222
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,340
 in Albuquerque to be held on April 20, 1979 to discuss the ongoing persistent problem

223
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:45,060
 of animal mutilations, and he wanted the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

224
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:54,320
 to investigate. And that 1979 meeting was held, and five months later in September 1979

225
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,680
 as Director of Special Projects at the CBS station in Denver, I began what became a nine-month,

226
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:08,360
 18-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week investigation. And I went to Santa Fe, and I did an interview

227
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:17,680
 with Senator Schmidt and one of the most important things that he told me was, to my question,

228
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:27,200
 are you aware of any intelligence committee or any agency that you have communicated with

229
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,680
 who has told you that we are dealing with extraterrestrial biological entities as perpetrators

230
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:40,960
 of worldwide animal mutilations as law enforcement repeatedly had told me? And I remember the

231
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:52,660
 pause and the look on his face when he said no, and I remember that his next words were,

232
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:59,820
 but I am not surprised at your question or the implications. And his request as a United

233
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,200
 States Senator to have the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation formally

234
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,440
 investigate animal mutilations was blocked. He told me that firsthand. The rest of the

235
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,560
 pages of the statement that I have submitted to you occurred after I was contracted with

236
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:27,400
 Home Box Office on March 21, 1983, to do an hour special that would follow up a strange

237
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,320
 harvest about the animal mutilations, and they had a working title in the contract that

238
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,760
 I would produce for them, an hour special called UFOs the ET Factor. And at the time,

239
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,560
 there was an attorney in New York named Peter Gersten. He was the first attorney to file

240
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:52,360
 against the CIA, the NSA, National Reconnaissance Organization, the Defense Intelligence Agency,

241
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:59,880
 and other military agencies under the brand new Freedom of Information Act FOIA for documents

242
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:07,320
 that those agencies had. And what Peter Gersten found was initially the Central Intelligence

243
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,520
 Agency denied that it had any information or documents, but that the National Security

244
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:20,060
 Agency had 118. So he would send the Central Intelligence Agency's formal letter to the

245
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:27,040
 National Security Agency asking for the documents referenced by the CIA. And the National Security

246
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,720
 Agency would send him a formal letter referencing the fact that the Central Intelligence Agency

247
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:40,240
 had 35 documents shared with the National Security Agency. And eventually, he assembled

248
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,280
 dozens of documents that came from those agencies, each one pointing a finger at the other. It

249
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,720
 went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court denied to hear what essentially was

250
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,640
 a New York attorney representing citizens against UFO secrecy and what was called ground

251
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,480
 saucer watch under the first Freedom of Information Act, simply asking for information from our

252
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:11,000
 government about documents that they all said they had. And even though the Supreme Court

253
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:23,120
 denied that they would take on that lawsuit, out of it came many pages of blacked out information

254
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,680
 that has been held up by Stanton Friedman and others of us over the years that agencies

255
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,040
 who are not allowed to speak and who have been responsible for counterintelligence since

256
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:43,760
 World War II to convince us that there's nothing to this phenomena. The witness has about one

257
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:51,080
 minute remaining. They are the very agencies who have the information and have been interlinked

258
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,400
 with Majestic 12 that was appointed by President Harry S. Truman within a very short period

259
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:05,680
 of time after the crash retrievals in July of 1947 and that Majestic 12, MJ12, whatever

260
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:13,240
 the letters and numbers are in 2013, the same kind of inner sanctum agency still exists

261
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,520
 interacting with other inside inner sanctum black agencies. There is a parallel black

262
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:27,800
 budget. There's a parallel government. And this is how the truth that this gentleman

263
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:35,200
 described and that many people in our government have known since at least 1941 when there

264
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,180
 was another crash retrieval from Missouri and an instrument called a Neutronic Propulsion

265
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:52,200
 Unit was hand delivered to Oppenheimer for his use in developing and researching what

266
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,760
 became the atomic bomb. And finally, the truth embargo so that you would have reference to

267
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:07,320
 the two agencies that in the beginning had the most information, the Atomic Energy Commission

268
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,940
 and the Department of the Navy, all of those documents of all of the truth that he has

269
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:24,360
 said that I have tried to report about now for 33 years, they are essentially off limits

270
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:32,240
 to any access by Congress or even the President because they are classified as only under

271
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,760
 a need to know and probably Suitland, Maryland archive has them.

272
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:48,880
 This is time. Thank you. I would like to now the panel will hear from Richard Dolan. You

273
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,240
 have ten minutes. Greetings, honored members of the committee.

274
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,240
 I'm very pleased about the interview that everyone was just shown and grateful that

275
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,400
 Linda Moulton Howe was able to elaborate on that. I'm happy to discuss this also if the

276
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,920
 committee members have questions but I have a different angle of approach this time. The

277
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:12,080
 truth embargo as I see it, as I understand it, let's call it a big picture analysis.

278
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,200
 I would start by saying one of the striking things about UFOs is simply the discrepancy

279
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,600
 between the quantity of astonishing sightings we have on the one hand and the lack of responsible

280
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:28,060
 treatment of this by our major media, also our academic and our scientific institutions

281
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:33,400
 and indeed our political system. This is a shame because there's very good research

282
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,560
 that's being done every day. Many of those researchers have been here this week. Others

283
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:46,080
 are out there too such as the National Aviation Reporting Center on anomalous phenomena, NARCAP,

284
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,560
 which was referenced in the previous panel by Jim Carant. They collect and analyze encounters

285
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,900
 that the aviation industry has had with unknown objects. There are thousands of such cases.

286
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:05,200
 Another group is Project 1947, which has documented UFO phenomena during the early Cold War years.

287
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,780
 There are outstanding web search websites such as ufoevidence.org. There are also many

288
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:17,080
 excellent research groups in Europe and elsewhere in the world. None of them get any love from

289
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,520
 America's dum-dum media, which prefers to lump the whole subject into a big tinfoil

290
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:30,160
 hat and instead write about the latest escapades of Kim Kardashian. This is a symptom. It's

291
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,160
 a symptom of a deeper problem. To understand why there is a truth embargo, we need to come

292
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,940
 to terms with the fact that America's major media groups lost their independence a long

293
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,340
 time ago. We all know about media consolidation. We all know about the intimate relationships

294
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,480
 that have existed for years between the elite members in the corporate media empire and

295
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,240
 the political leadership and particularly with the military and intelligence community.

296
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,400
 Last year, one example only, it was learned that the Pentagon spends some $4 billion a

297
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:09,660
 year to sway public opinion. Now, aside from asking just why Americans ought to be paying

298
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,480
 their own government to brainwash them, I mean, talk about getting shafted both ways,

299
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,000
 right? This is just one facet of many that highlight a revolving door through which passes

300
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,120
 the military industrial complex, the media, the academic community and more. National

301
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,440
 security money, which is our nation's greatest and most egregious waste of all, has infiltrated

302
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,800
 everything and that certainly means the once-upon-a-time integrity of our journalists and media corporations.

303
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,240
 This is repugnant to any freedom-loving people. But those individuals benefiting from this

304
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,160
 system are not freedom-loving unless they mean their own freedom. The bottom line is

305
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,920
 that because UFOs are a definite matter of national security, those national security

306
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:00,160
 decision-makers have made it certain that this subject remains out of sight as much

307
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:08,200
 as possible. Is this not obvious by now? Now, why would they do this? Well, many reasons.

308
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,560
 Let's touch on the matter of oil because even a child can understand that these objects

309
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,040
 don't need oil to go from point A to point B. Whatever powers, flying saucers, it's

310
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,120
 something different, something better. So if the President were to announce the reality

311
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,080
 of these things, how long do you think it would take before scientists openly begin

312
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,920
 to study the nature of the propulsion and power system of UFOs? This would immediately

313
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,480
 challenge oil, not simply as the world's leading source of power, but it would severely threaten

314
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,760
 the entire global financial system, which is based upon oil. And probably 90 percent

315
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,400
 of the value of any product you can think of is determined by the energy that went into

316
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,440
 making and transporting it, and in most cases that means oil. To say nothing of the millions

317
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,680
 of jobs that rely on the petroleum industry. We're talking one big overhaul of everything

318
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,320
 that matters in the global economy. Can we think for an instant that those individuals

319
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,080
 in the know haven't thought about this? Especially if there is that holy grail involved, some

320
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:17,200
 form of free energy. What if this new form of energy can't be easily monetized? What

321
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,260
 if? Could the global financial structure afford free energy? A perverse question to be sure,

322
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,720
 but one that has to be important to those individuals at the top of the human power

323
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,760
 structure. And of course there is the political nightmare. Any announcement of this reality

324
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,960
 would come at the cost of worldwide public anger. No one wants to learn that they've

325
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,800
 been lied to for an entire human lifetime. They would want to know just how this secret

326
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,160
 was kept. That's very, very big key right there. That would lead inevitably to questions

327
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,000
 about why Congress was kept out of the loop, why our major institutions missed the boat,

328
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,460
 and just who has been managing the secret. And that would lead, obviously, to a wholesale

329
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:05,960
 investigation of black budget America shining sunlight into a very dark place. And what

330
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:12,080
 might we find? Well, consider. Just consider that Roswell was indeed what the researchers

331
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,480
 here two days ago discussed so eloquently and cogently, that it was the retrieval of

332
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,000
 alien technology and perhaps bodies. In fact, there are a number of well-researched UFO

333
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,120
 crash events. So suppose for a moment that it happened. That would mean that the cover-up

334
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,880
 involves much more than mere knowledge of other beings here on planet Earth. It would

335
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,840
 mean there is possession of such advanced technology as to be nearly incomprehensible

336
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:45,560
 at least at first. Hard to consider, and yet an inevitable conclusion. So what happens

337
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,860
 when teams of brilliant scientists with total secrecy and nearly limitless black budget

338
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:57,700
 funds are able to study recovered alien technology for many years and even decades? Could it

339
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,520
 not be that given enough time and effort, even if they couldn't replicate what they

340
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,660
 found, they might have learned a few things. Some such claims have been made, and it's

341
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,120
 reasonable to suppose that breakthroughs would have been made. Breakthroughs such as solid

342
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,880
 state electronics, fiber optics, high tensile fibers, lasers, and an array of other money-making

343
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,840
 opportunities for the defense and other industries. None of this has been proven, but it is also

344
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,640
 true that the private research undertaken in classified environments is not easy for

345
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,360
 outside researchers to observe. In fact, it would be very easy to hide the Roswell connection

346
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,060
 in the historical treatment of these and other technologies. Another relevant consideration

347
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:46,120
 of such breakthroughs is that they would reduce to zero any incentive to reveal the secret

348
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:52,160
 to the public. Why give up the goose that lays golden eggs? But now matters become even

349
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,920
 more interesting, because what if some of the breakthroughs were even more significant?

350
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,680
 What if they included secrets to what is known as field propulsion or electro-gravitics?

351
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,960
 What if they led to a new source of energy, something that could replace petroleum? To

352
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,160
 those managing these special access programs, they could never allow such breakthroughs

353
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,360
 to see the light of day. Of course, those scientists doing the research would need to

354
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,300
 continue and learn everything they could about electro-gravitics, anti-gravity, new sources

355
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:28,040
 of energy, and any related topics. Consider also what happens when such breakthroughs

356
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:34,320
 become classified. We know it happens all too frequently that public science has become

357
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,920
 hostage to national security. What we're looking at is a situation in which the classified

358
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,520
 black-budget world, at least part of it, has gone so far ahead of the rest of us, we may

359
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:53,460
 with justice almost look upon them as a separate society, something I have sometimes called

360
00:38:53,460 --> 00:39:00,080
 a breakaway civilization. How far ahead might some of that classified world be? Those of

361
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,960
 us on the outside trying to peek in can only make educated guesses or investigate occasional

362
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:12,040
 leaks. My own conclusion, at least for now, is that they are very far ahead indeed, with

363
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,880
 the ability even to enter and leave Earth orbit with much greater ease than people suspect,

364
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,920
 perhaps a clandestine space fleet, most likely a significant built infrastructure, a large

365
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,360
 portion of which is deep underground, and even, why not, possible encounters with non-human

366
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,940
 intelligences? Why would that be so impossible? To what extent would such a group even answer

367
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,560
 to the President of the United States? Do they rather answer to private, international

368
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,220
 financial powers, which basically is how the whole world already operates? I had a long

369
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:52,360
 conversation once with a retired senior intelligence official. He had given briefings to-

370
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,040
 I hate to interrupt. The witness has about one minute, at least one.

371
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,280
 One minute left, thank you. This gentleman had given briefings to President Reagan. This

372
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,600
 man knows a very great deal about UFOs and told me that he had spoken to 18 former presidents,

373
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,160
 CIA directors, and DOD secretaries about UFOs after their retirement. Their attitudes fell

374
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,280
 into three categories. One group, roughly three or four of them, said essentially, "What's

375
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,200
 wrong with you? Why waste your time with that nonsense?" Another equally small group made

376
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,120
 it clear that they had been briefed on the matter and knew that it was serious. But the

377
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,600
 largest group, at least half of all of the individuals who had been at the pinnacle of

378
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,920
 power, had said, "You know about UFOs? I would love to know about that, but got nowhere.

379
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,600
 Can you share what you know?" In other words, our top political leadership, with a few exceptions,

380
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:50,720
 is locked out of this subject because they come and go. But the program managers are

381
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,280
 lifers. They seem to answer to someone else. Recall the words of the late Senator Daniel

382
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,120
 Inouye from 1987, "There exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own

383
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,400
 Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of national

384
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,000
 interests, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself." He was on to

385
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 something.

386
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:24,560
 Thank you. You are, the last two witnesses have been particularly good at keeping it

387
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:31,420
 right within the time limit. We sure appreciate that. Jeffrey Torres, you've got 10 minutes.

388
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:38,320
 My pleasure. Well, good day to everybody. My name is Jeffrey Torres. I'm not going to

389
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:44,840
 talk about myself much. I'm a veteran. I served the United States Air Force. I'm talking here

390
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:50,920
 today about my father. I'm the son of Major Milton John Torres. My father served in the

391
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:58,000
 U.S. Air Force from 1951 to 1971, and regrettably, my father cannot attend this hearing as he

392
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 is now suffering from ill health directly related to combat from the Vietnam War. I

393
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,040
 told him before I left that I was coming on his behalf, and he expressed his deep gratitude

394
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:19,080
 that I was coming here today to testify and tell you folks his story. First of all, I

395
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:24,360
 would like to give you a brief history of who my father was and his accomplishments.

396
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,360
 Dad earned a bachelor's degree in general engineering with a minor in chemistry, and

397
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,640
 completed his master's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Oklahoma

398
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:38,520
 in 1961. His military career was spent over the span of 20 years. Dad served as a fighter

399
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:45,040
 pilot, flying the F-86D, and according to him, the best airplane ever made, as well

400
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,680
 as the F-100. He was a decorated pilot, achieving the title of USAF command pilot. Dad flew

401
00:42:51,680 --> 00:43:01,400
 over 300 combat missions in Vietnam as a forward air controller in Vietnam. He received 13

402
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:08,480
 air medals, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, and I know firsthand that he was even

403
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,080
 put in for the Air Force Cross, which he denied because of political reasons, which we'll

404
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:20,080
 not get into here. My father attained a rank of major, as well as during his career he

405
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:27,620
 also worked with NASA as a chief of range control for the Gemini and Apollo Moon missions.

406
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:34,800
 After Dad retired from the United States Air Force, Dad worked for Pan Am as an engineer,

407
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,760
 and later acquired his doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of Miami.

408
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,160
 My father's last job was as a professor at Florida National University teaching engineering.

409
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,560
 During his tenure at FIU, he invented a chemical encoding process using a polymer to prevent

410
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:57,680
 catastrophic metal fatigue on aircraft and received a patent for that process. Dad retired

411
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:06,040
 from FIU in 2004. So now we'll go on to Dad's story and the event that happened. I will

412
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,480
 go into some details he shared with our family, but before I do, I want to point out something

413
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:19,600
 here. That my father, he kept his secret for over 50 years. He never told anyone and he

414
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:26,600
 honored his oath to this country. And he never had the chance to tell his story to my grandfather,

415
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,840
 his father who he loved very, very much. And I've never seen my father cry until this story

416
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:42,480
 broke. Sadly, my father kept it all from everyone, including us and my family. Not even telling

417
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:50,560
 his father's story when he was the closest man that he ever had. I know Dad would never

418
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,800
 have discussed this event if not for it being declassified by the Minister of Defense, Nick

419
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:05,320
 Pope, out of the UK. After the event was declassified, Dad shared the story often with us. It was

420
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:15,000
 May 20th, 1957. Dad was stationed at RAF Manston, England. Dad was working on intercept standby.

421
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,200
 Of course, this was a cycle between the pilots in this particular event. It was Dad's turn.

422
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:25,760
 Dad was again flying the F-86D. This aircraft was a D model, which meant it was an all-weather

423
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,480
 fighter. Dad told me that the RAF Manston was a main intercept squadron during the Cold

424
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,680
 War in England. Dad was on alert with his wingman and some of the ground crew in the

425
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,440
 ready room. That night was a typical English night with the weather being poor and foggy.

426
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,040
 The notification came down from the ready room indicating a scramble. Dad ran for his

427
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:57,560
 plane. The scramble was initiated. Dad jumped in his cockpit. If you could please, I put

428
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:07,040
 the photo of Dad's aircraft, if anybody would like to see the airplane. I have one saved

429
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:16,360
 on there. Anyhow, so he jumped in his cockpit upon getting the authentication code to fire.

430
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,720
 He then realized that this was no drill. They normally would never give you an authentication

431
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,240
 code, and they told him it was a hot mission. He had orders to shoot this thing down. Dad

432
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,680
 told me whatever this thing was, they wanted it down, and he thought he was starting World

433
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,760
 War III. All kinds of thoughts were in his head. The intercept controller ordered Dad

434
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,920
 to fire a full salvo of 24 rockets at this object. Dad later told me that he knew full

435
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:48,720
 well how serious this event was. Dad was in his aircraft. His aircraft came to life, and

436
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,480
 he was given an order to go gate, which meant full afterburners were to be used after getting

437
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,840
 airborne. Dad said, "Do you want me to continue with the afterburners? Affirmative. Go gate."

438
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,000
 In other words, they wanted him to close in on this thing, and they wanted him there fast.

439
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,720
 Dad was told to vector over to the North Sea. The object had been sighted hovering over

440
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:16,240
 East Ipswich. Dad told me he had a confirmation of the target acquisition from the ground

441
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,200
 radar. His jet flying with full afterburners was now headed towards the North Sea, and

442
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,200
 Dad was flying at 32,000 feet, and full afterburner and heavy cloud cover with zero visibility.

443
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:35,120
 However, his radar was painting a target as big as an aircraft carrier at that altitude.

444
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,400
 Dad was fast approaching the target, and the object kept pulling in front of him just beyond

445
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:47,980
 range. It was toying with him. Finally, he was able to get his radar lock on the object.

446
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,960
 Dad said this thing was huge, and the blip was so big that it was easy to get target

447
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:58,040
 acquisition. Right before he got the instruction to fire from the radar control set, the target

448
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:07,680
 made an erratic side-to-side movement and moved beyond range, causing Dad to lose lock

449
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:17,560
 on his target. The object then accelerated from zero to Mach 10 in seconds, and Dad was

450
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:23,380
 unable to fire as a result. He lost complete lock. Dad told me his radar, his wingman's

451
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,160
 radar and the ground radar confirmed it as well. They had lost lock, and they were totally

452
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:34,180
 perplexed as to what happened. So, to make a long story short, the most compelling thing

453
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:39,680
 Dad said was that this thing was doing things that an ordinary aircraft could do. It was

454
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:50,640
 defying the laws of physics, and he was convinced that it was of alien origin. Anyhow, during

455
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,560
 that time, there was nothing in the Air Force that could come close to it. The F-86 could

456
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:03,880
 barely make Mach .98 Mach. It would make Mach 1 in its complete dive at the time, and this

457
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:12,240
 thing did Mach 10. There was no known aircraft that could do this. So, upon landing his aircraft,

458
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,040
 Dad was contacted by the intercept officer on a secure phone. The person on the line

459
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:22,160
 told him that what happened was considered classified, and not to discuss this with anyone,

460
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:29,120
 from his wingman to his commander. He would be debriefed in the morning. Dad told me he

461
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,400
 realized how lucky he was, as if he did manage to fire at this object, he probably would

462
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:44,160
 have vaporized him. Off the record, he was scared shitless. So, he did tell me that the

463
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:51,360
 following day, Dad reported for duty, a call came in from a man that was from the NSA,

464
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:58,280
 and that he called him a spook. For us, it was much more personal, this whole event,

465
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:05,120
 because the spook came in, and swore Dad to secrecy that he would never, ever repeat what

466
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,360
 he'd seen, and it was a matter of national security. The guy showed his credentials,

467
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,640
 he locked himself in a room with Dad for about a half hour, and threatened to pull his wings,

468
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:22,120
 and everything else that he held dear, including, you know, God knows his family.

469
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,260
 The witness has about one more minute. Okay, I'll make it short. You know, my Dad

470
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:36,960
 waited 40 years for this, and forgive me. I'll make it quick here. You know, guys like

471
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:45,080
 my Dad are heroes. Guys like Edgar Mitchell. When I was a kid, I watched these guys from

472
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:50,800
 the side of the beach watching the Apollo moon launches, and now we're riding with

473
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:59,000
 the Russians to the moon now. We can't even go ourselves anymore. And yet, the media has

474
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,400
 blasphemized these great men. You know, how can they? How dare them? How dare them, and

475
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,720
 how dare everybody stay silent here? When people like my Dad held this secret, people

476
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:19,240
 who died and that never could tell a secret in Vietnam. It's a shame. It's a real shame

477
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,800
 that our media has bought and paid for by the Kardashians and the corporate industries

478
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,200
 of this country and the world. And this truth needs to come out because there's a lot of

479
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,040
 people, including my family, who suffered and ridiculed. My father got ridiculed, my

480
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,680
 brother took phone calls from ridiculing people, and my Dad had a Ph.D. What more do they want?

481
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:44,680
 Astrophysicists are saying these things are real and we're being ridiculed. That's all

482
00:51:44,680 --> 00:52:14,000
 I have to say. Help this country. [Applause]

483
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,500
 Okay, we need to get going. I want to thank the panel very much and indicate to the members

484
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:31,440
 that we've got six minutes each for questioning. I will reserve my minutes and we'll reverse

485
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:42,360
 the order a bit here, so we're to Senator Grovel. Linda, would you, when this gentleman

486
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:49,720
 that was interviewed, and this would go to Richard also, when he was talking about that

487
00:52:49,720 --> 00:53:02,480
 he saw an extraterrestrial being, was it dead or alive? So we had imprisoned this person

488
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,040
 or this being. Could you elaborate a little bit about that?

489
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:16,440
 Many more than one. We have had many more than one. In this particular case, this was

490
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:24,960
 at Area 51 inside of the Papoose Mountain. If you look at a map, the inside of the Papoose

491
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:34,320
 Mountain at Area 51 is an installation, multi-leveled, hidden by the Papoose Mountain. Many people

492
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:43,240
 have leaked to me and to others about working there. And in there are offices, as we would

493
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:55,760
 recognize as offices, and his CIA boss and the man in the film and a couple of others

494
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:02,860
 were taken to one of these offices where there was a one way on the other side. I don't know

495
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:10,440
 because it's his point of view. Was it a mirror or was it a reflective glass, but nevertheless,

496
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,200
 the man you just heard was standing on this side of the glass looking at his boss in the

497
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:23,240
 room with, I believe it was two others. And then the gray alien was dressed in something

498
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:34,160
 like they had tried to make it look sort of American. It had on a t-shirt and as if they

499
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:43,440
 had put clothes on it right at the last minute for this meeting. And it was telepathic and

500
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:52,360
 each mind in the room was communicated with telepathically. And he had a discussion later

501
00:54:52,360 --> 00:55:02,720
 on with his boss. And the general impression was that the non-human was trying to answer

502
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:10,840
 their questions, but that it was very succinct and that they ask questions such as how many

503
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:17,440
 of you are here on this planet? There would be no answer. There would be other questions

504
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,440
 that were of a technical nature and there would be no answer. And yet, on other questions,

505
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,440
 they all clearly heard telepathic information.

506
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,920
 >> Elaborate on telepathic information.

507
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,920
 >> Mind to mind.

508
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,920
 >> Mind to mind.

509
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:42,720
 >> I would just add, I recall the witness speaking about that and certainly it's exactly

510
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,200
 right, Linda, what he said to me. In terms of the one, very few specific answers this

511
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:54,200
 being allegedly gave, but to one, why are they here? There was not a direct answer except

512
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:59,640
 a reply that we are not hostile or thoughts to that effect.

513
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:09,040
 >> When you say telepathic, that means that the being was communicating directly, understood

514
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,480
 the way our mind worked. Now, were we able to telepathically communicate with them or

515
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,920
 was it a one way street?

516
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:24,640
 >> I can add something here along those lines. And then humans by definition live in a mental

517
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:35,240
 island. And we're dealing with intelligences that not only can place thoughts, images,

518
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:43,360
 movies, symbols, directly into human minds very easily, they simultaneously upload information

519
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:50,200
 from human minds. And I have had the experience of talking with a man who was working for

520
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:57,400
 the Central Intelligence Agency when he had an interaction with one of these beings. There

521
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:05,320
 have been many, sir. And that his whole mission was to have the experience of the upload download

522
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:12,840
 telepathically with a being under a completely nonthreatening, totally organized fashion.

523
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:19,160
 And he told me that they had warned him that the process of the telepathic download upload

524
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:28,440
 usually disables humans, humans usually faint. And that he had the experience and the way

525
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:33,560
 he described it was he said, Linda, imagine seven feature films going through your mind

526
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:42,360
 at the same time with heat, temperature, sense, sound, all of the senses and more. And then

527
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:50,060
 overlying those seven feature films are three-dimensional gold symbols that we would relate probably

528
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:57,200
 to Sumerian cuneiform or Assyrian symbols. And that all of that goes through your head

529
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:03,440
 in a matter of what your brain, your human brain, not being able to interact but has

530
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:10,120
 a sense of very rapid time. And that when it's all over, as he said, if God asked me

531
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:15,480
 what had been downloaded into my mind, I could not tell you. But I know that everything that

532
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:23,160
 I have ever lived was uploaded. That is, frankly, the level of telepathic interaction that has

533
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,440
 been going on in this planet for a very long time.

534
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:32,360
 My time has expired, but maybe later on I'll come back because I have other questions.

535
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:44,920
 Thank you. We'll go to Representative Hooley. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.

536
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:52,460
 You talked about your father. Thank you very much for doing that. That he had kept the

537
00:58:52,460 --> 00:59:05,840
 secret for years. How or why did he finally communicate the information to you and the

538
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:13,240
 family? Well, it started much later. He started organizing

539
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:24,940
 RAF Manson reunions. He so loved his squadron that he organized trips to England and cruises.

540
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,680
 And I met his buddies, by the way, and they were all just the greatest guys, a lot of

541
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:36,560
 them World War II veterans. And he would organize these trips. And, you know, I guess at this

542
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:41,680
 point he started trying to find out answers as to why this had happened to him. So he

543
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:47,320
 was asking his squadron mates. And I guess he felt a little comfortable at that point.

544
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:54,480
 He had been retired for a number of years. And he ran across Nick Pope and they were

545
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,080
 able to declassify the event. But it took many years after that that it was declassified.

546
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:09,280
 But he had started to speak about it after the reunions. But he would never speak publicly.

547
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:15,240
 And you know, as a matter of fact, I had no idea that this had happened, that he had carried

548
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:24,560
 that burden. And my grandfather and him were extremely tight. And he cried that he couldn't

549
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,960
 tell his own father because of that secret. And he didn't tell his soul. Can you imagine

550
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:36,600
 dog fighting like this fellow the other day from Peru and yet when he landed, the spooks

551
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,480
 that were there on the ground greeted him and said, hey, let's find out what that was.

552
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,960
 Our spooks told him never talk about it to anybody, including your wife, your kids, your

553
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:52,760
 family, your colonel, your commander. Nobody could he talk to. Nobody. And he carried that.

554
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,760
 And I can tell you when I saw him cry on stage, my dad has now lost his voice because of,

555
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:07,480
 you know, Agent Orange and all of the crap that goes with it. But I found mine. I'm my

556
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:16,320
 father's son. I will get answers. I promised him that. So thank you.

557
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:41,280
 Mr. Dolan, is there a way to put together people? For example, we've heard a lot over

558
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:56,520
 the last four and a half days about the number of pilots who have seen other kinds of vehicles

559
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:06,680
 that are not from the United States or from this world flying. Is there a way to get some

560
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:15,120
 of these pilots together? Are they willing to talk about what they saw? Do you know?

561
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:20,560
 Thank you for the question. First of all, I would just repeat the name of the organization

562
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:27,520
 I mentioned earlier in my statement, NARCAP, which is the National Aviation Reporting Center

563
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:33,840
 on Anomalous Phenomenon. I mention them because they are very rigorous, very scientific, very

564
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:40,880
 low key, very nonsensational, and deal precisely with these individuals that you're talking

565
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:48,080
 about and have done so for decades. There have been a number of cases in which we've

566
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:53,400
 had pilots go on the record. In fact, there's no lack of very good data and information

567
01:02:53,400 --> 01:03:00,880
 out there. The problem is, unfortunately, that these individuals who are all sober and

568
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:08,440
 careful and, as you heard in the previous panel, still get ridiculed by the media. They

569
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:14,320
 get the tinfoil hat placed on them. This is something that none of us have found a way

570
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:20,240
 to get around that, no matter how rigorous we are. In my own work years ago when I started

571
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,560
 researching this phenomenon, I had this naive idea. Really, I did that. If I just did the

572
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,880
 most rigorous, careful, historical treatment of the phenomenon that I could, then that

573
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:37,520
 just might be the magic bullet, the bat that hits the ball out of the park. It didn't happen.

574
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:43,960
 We keep trying. I would say that we're in an era now where global communication among

575
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:51,120
 researchers has improved and is improving. I am looking forward to, I think, the next

576
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:55,760
 few years where there really should be better coordination among groups in the United States

577
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:02,240
 and elsewhere to be able to put together events like this. I think more is better.

578
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:08,440
 I think with the social media that there's a possibility that you might be able to do

579
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:20,200
 that. People seem to trust pilots. Rightfully or wrongfully, they trust pilots. They're

580
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:25,520
 the most logical group who fly all the time. We are back and forth across this country,

581
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:34,040
 across this world, that as they see what they've seen, it seems to me that there would be some

582
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:42,960
 validity. I mean, the public would accept that premise if enough of them got together

583
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,960
 and talked about it.

584
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,840
 When you add up enough of the near misses and encounters that are up in the air, it's

585
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,840
 startling.

586
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,160
 I noticed the gentlelady's time has expired.

587
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,160
 Thank you.

588
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:57,620
 We'll then go to Representative Woolsey. You have six minutes.

589
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:02,160
 Thank you, Jeffrey Torres, for your testimony.

590
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,800
 Thank you.

591
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:09,720
 Thank you so much. Congratulations, Richard, for that video.

592
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,720
 Thank you.

593
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:17,800
 You did such an amazing job. It was so helpful because you didn't leave the witness ever.

594
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:25,200
 I mean, the gentleman, it was clear that's who he is and that's what he wanted to say.

595
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,200
 Thank you very much.

596
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,200
 Thank you very much.

597
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:41,080
 Linda, you have said, I think more than once this week, that non-humans are acting within

598
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:47,440
 our environment. What do you mean by that? And how do you know that's happening? And

599
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,360
 give me some examples.

600
01:05:51,360 --> 01:06:16,920
 Other than being in a space vehicle and coming to Earth. Well, if that's it, tell me that.

601
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:25,600
 I guess it's the accumulation of so many people that have talked to me off the record, who

602
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,680
 have died.

603
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,680
 Who have died?

604
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:36,000
 That I was given a chance to talk to people who were in some sort of the end of their

605
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,120
 days and I'd either been sought out or I had been referenced. And when you were talking

606
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:48,680
 to people who are essentially on their deathbed and they are describing for you the interactions

607
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:55,600
 that they've had with extraterrestrial biological entities in the context of their professional

608
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:01,560
 capacity for the United States government, how would I question what they were saying

609
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,360
 to me?

610
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:12,240
 Can I provide for you right here in this room one of the many different types of extraterrestrial

611
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:23,080
 biological entities? I cannot. Do I believe that these primarily male individuals who

612
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:30,600
 have shown to me at least enough evidence about where they worked publicly, which not

613
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:37,520
 always connects to where they get their paycheck, that they are telling me the truth about their

614
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:45,560
 life and their experiences with extraterrestrial biological entities, craft, technology, the

615
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:51,080
 physics that we have been encountering and stunned by?

616
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:59,160
 I believe them. And I'm a long time TV producer and investigative reporter. And as I have

617
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:06,160
 said before, the challenge of getting people on the record is the single biggest difficulty

618
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:14,620
 in this entire field because since World War II, our extremely good and sophisticated counterintelligence

619
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:21,640
 units that got us through World War II are exactly the people who took over at the request

620
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:29,440
 of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman. How do you keep all of this evolving from

621
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,920
 the press, the media, Congress, the Supreme Court and every other government agency?

622
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:45,080
 Yeah, okay. But thank you. Somewhere between now and the end of this day, I'd like somebody

623
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:56,040
 to describe for me the different nonhumans that have been observed and what the differences

624
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:02,320
 are and do they intermingle? I think we've not asked that question.

625
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,880
 Well I can give you at least a short answer. Okay.

626
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:11,060
 One man who retired from the Defense Intelligence Agency who sought me out because of something

627
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:16,760
 I had published in one of my four books and he had been exposed to it but because everything

628
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:21,840
 is so compartmentalized on a need to know basis, he came to me as a reporter and it

629
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:27,840
 goes to the heart of what he said. He said, "My job when I was working for the Defense

630
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:33,140
 Intelligence Agency was to study and monitor the geopolitical territorial conflicts of

631
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:38,080
 three extraterrestrial biological entities who have been involved with this planet for

632
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:44,600
 at least 270 million years." He broke them down as blonde-haired, blue-eyed that we would

633
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:51,840
 not distinguish from the so-called archangels of history. The second group would be standing

634
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:58,280
 up reptoids and the third group would be a huge variety of what are called grays.

635
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:04,200
 Okay. And do they intermingle? Are they all separate?

636
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,240
 They do not get along. They do not get along.

637
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:15,520
 I would add, if I may, that research has pointed out even a greater variety than this. Depending

638
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:22,080
 on how you deal with abduction research, there is some of this that's fairly extensive. They

639
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:26,960
 would talk about insectoid-type creatures. And then let's not forget there are a large

640
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:32,120
 number of individuals who have had or claim to have, sometimes I think persuasively to

641
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:37,440
 be honest with you, some form of contact with other beings that is not physical. This is

642
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:44,920
 a very difficult subject to get one's hand on, but these stories do not go away. Who

643
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,480
 are these beings? Are they good, bad, and different to our fate is another issue we

644
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:54,960
 can discuss. In terms of interrelationships, you're asking exactly the kind of question

645
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,080
 that many researchers still would like to get to the bottom of.

646
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,560
 Okay. Thank you. Tom, my time is up.

647
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:13,600
 Yes, thank you. Jeffrey Torres, I was very interested in your testimony. You said something

648
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:19,200
 and I think I know what you meant, but you didn't exactly say it this way, so I'm going

649
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:24,800
 to ask you if this is what you meant. It's kind of a yes or no question. You said that

650
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:31,120
 what your father witnessed in terms of the maneuverability of a particular object defied

651
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:38,320
 the law of physics. Well, I don't think physics law, as we currently understand it, says that

652
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:44,240
 you can't move very, very quickly. There's no limit on acceleration or velocity to my

653
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,040
 understanding. Of course, Dr. Bartlett may be able to help us more than I can on that,

654
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:55,080
 but what I think you meant to say is it defies any technology we know that can achieve those

655
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:00,280
 kinds of accelerations and motions. Am I correct in understanding that?

656
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:05,000
 Well, more than that, what he meant was that if there was a fighter pilot in that other

657
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,520
 aircraft, he would have died from the G-forces. There were so many extreme maneuvers that this

658
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:22,360
 thing had made. Actually, he was convinced that it was of alien origin. Because of that,

659
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:29,640
 he actually went to college for his aerospace engineering degree. Then he worked with Werner

660
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:41,840
 von Braun in the NASA space program under the Saturn and several of the moon launches.

661
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:47,440
 He ended up doing a PhD. He had so many questions.

662
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,960
 I have no question of his qualifications. It just was an impact on him. He just couldn't

663
01:12:52,960 --> 01:13:00,080
 understand it. He wanted knowledge. He's wondering if there might be another extraterrestrial

664
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,760
 explanation of what he observed. It's interesting because—

665
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,200
 I need to reclaim my time, I'm sorry. It's an interesting answer. What I was going

666
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,680
 to tell you is out of all the people in my life I've encountered, my dad was a constant

667
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:17,240
 scientist. He was an atheist. He was just this total white-lane brain.

668
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:22,640
 I appreciate it. Thank you. I believe that he was an outstanding scientist.

669
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:28,640
 I'm going to turn to you and ask you this. Researchers have looked at a lot of things

670
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:36,000
 related to this. The maneuver abilities are certainly interesting. One of the reasons

671
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:45,680
 why I think there is skepticism that these objects have extraterrestrial origins is because

672
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:54,760
 of, I'll just put it bluntly, Einstein's relativity theory that nothing can go faster

673
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:01,520
 than the speed of light. What are the most compelling studies of people

674
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:09,640
 that could explain distance questions without suspending Einstein's theory of relativity,

675
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:14,000
 law of physics that's well accepted that nothing can travel faster than the speed of

676
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,480
 light? Mr. Cook, I'm very, very grateful you asked

677
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:24,000
 that question. First of all, I just want to mention that regarding atmospheric phenomena,

678
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,680
 atmospheric objects that seem to defy the laws of physics, but of course they don't.

679
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,960
 Nothing defies the laws of physics. The question was asked previously, why don't they make

680
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:39,120
 sonic booms? How do the piles withstand G-forces? All of this is related. I would just point

681
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:43,960
 out there was an outstanding study done years ago by a retired NASA scientist, Paul Hales,

682
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:50,800
 who was known throughout NASA as their go-to guy for UFOs. His exact question was how is

683
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:57,080
 it that UFOs do what they do? His conclusion in his study published posthumously in the

684
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:02,080
 1990s called Unconventional Flying Objects of Scientific Analysis was that they do not.

685
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,940
 If you assume, because nothing works aerodynamically, it doesn't make sense, but it makes sense

686
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:13,800
 if you factor in what he called field propulsion, that is a kind of anti-gravity. In fact, now

687
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,480
 what he couldn't figure out was what is the source of power for that. No one knows that.

688
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:23,160
 But actually, he did an outstanding work. His mathematics is very sound, and I would

689
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:28,360
 simply recommend it to everyone. Now the distance problem has also been discussed by a number

690
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:36,280
 of scientists in the last generation. Probably most famously, the mathematician Miguel Alcubierre,

691
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:44,800
 who, the math on what he did seems to be very, very good according to physicists, essentially

692
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,600
 think warp drive and Star Trek in the sense that if you have a source of power significant

693
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:57,360
 enough, it is possible and has been demonstrated mathematically for a craft literally to kind

694
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:03,720
 of shrink the space ahead and elongate it behind. You're not violating Einstein's E

695
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,920
 equals MC squared. It is literally space itself. I am going to reclaim my time only for the

696
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:14,120
 reason to just get this last question to you. When you say that you are kind of using anti-gravity

697
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:20,240
 as a way of saying we don't have to suspend Einstein's first theory of relativity, but

698
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:26,240
 if you do that, then you are suspending his second theory, the general gravitational theories.

699
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,280
 So what I am asking, let me ask you this. Aren't there researchers out there that have

700
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:38,240
 put together concepts or statements or proposed theories that say, hey, if you travel at even

701
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:43,320
 10% of the speed of light and if you have... Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, Stan

702
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,420
 and Friedman, who is here earlier this week, has discussed this at length. There is a gentleman

703
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:50,880
 named Paul LeVoillet, another named Thomas Vallone, both of whom have done a lot of work

704
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,920
 in lecture gravatics. I think it is very sound and worth anyone's attention. Thank you. I

705
01:16:54,920 --> 01:17:01,320
 see my time has expired. So we are going with you, Representative Fire. Thank you very much.

706
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:07,440
 A man who may be able to know all these physics rules that I don't. Thank you all very much

707
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:17,080
 for your testimony. That there is a cloak of frequency, I think, is undeniable. Like

708
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:29,320
 the symptoms of a very serious disease, if the doctor doesn't know the etiology of the

709
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:36,320
 disease, it becomes very difficult to treat the symptoms. How in the heck did we get here

710
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:43,920
 with this cloak of secrecy? You really can't treat the disease until you know how it was

711
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:51,520
 engendered. I appreciate your testimony, Mr. Dolan, very much. You suggested at least one

712
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:59,320
 possible etiology for this symptom of this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest another one

713
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:07,020
 that may give us the hope that it will be reversed. Because if you're right, and I hope

714
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:12,180
 you're not, but if you're right, there is no hope, or little hope, that they're going

715
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:19,400
 to reverse this cloak of secrecy. Let me suggest another one. For 20 years before I came to

716
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:24,120
 the Congress, I worked for the military in every capacity you can work for the military.

717
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:30,680
 Directly for them, captive Navy contractor, eight years for IBM. As an independent contractor,

718
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:35,640
 Roscoe Bartlett and Associates doing research work for the military. For the past 20 years

719
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:41,720
 until just four months ago, I was in the U.S. government, 20 years on the Armed Services

720
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:48,080
 Committee, 20 years interfacing with the leaders of our military and our government. I will

721
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:53,040
 tell you that I think that all of those that I have met make their decisions on the base

722
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:58,960
 of what they think is best for America. And I think that these decisions, I would like

723
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,560
 to believe that this decision, it was made very quickly after Roswell, was it not? Within

724
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:08,240
 a few hours, the decision was made that we were going to have a cloak of secrecy over

725
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,940
 this thing. Let me suggest that they made that cloak of secrecy because they thought

726
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:17,420
 that if they revealed the truth to the American people, they would be panicked. Like the panic

727
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:25,440
 after War of the Worlds on radio with H.G. Wells. If that was in fact their, the ideology

728
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:32,560
 for this, then it becomes pretty easy to reverse it. Because now after all these years, there

729
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:39,360
 is no evidence that if they are extraterrestrials, there is no evidence that they are hostile.

730
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,160
 So now, all these years we have been trying to protect the American people from themselves.

731
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:46,600
 I am not sure I agree with that judgment, by the way, that they need to be protected

732
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,540
 from themselves. But all these years we have been protecting them because we knew better

733
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:58,000
 than they. But now obviously there is no threat because these people have been here for a

734
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,520
 very long time, if in fact they are extraterrestrials. So now we can come clean with the American

735
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,600
 people. How about that?

736
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:16,360
 Wise words, sir. I agree with you. I think that the secret has its own momentum. It generates

737
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:20,320
 its own profitability. It generates its own bureaucracy. It generates its own need to

738
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:25,280
 continue, it seems to me. How do you tell the world that you have been lying for sixty

739
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,920
 plus years? I think you tell them, sir, because you thought that was what you had to do because

740
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,960
 you couldn't have the kind of panic that occurred after the War of the Worlds, this little thing

741
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,680
 on radio. Certainly we agree on this. And certainly I think we could say that in the

742
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:44,880
 very beginning the secrecy would have started precisely because it was not known. How could

743
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,880
 President Truman really know what he was dealing with? How could his advisors really know?

744
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:53,920
 So it seems logical to me, and I am sure many people think about it, that you would say,

745
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,560
 wait a minute, let's get together, let's think about this, let's figure out what we have

746
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:04,320
 and we will come to a decision at a certain period of time. My own belief is that breakthroughs

747
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:08,680
 in understanding the technology were made, greed comes into the factor, money comes into

748
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:15,680
 the factor, power, and the incentive just goes away. I think that through the Eisenhower

749
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:20,040
 years at the very least it went away. How quickly, sir, did they know that there

750
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:25,240
 were entities, these biological entities? I hesitate to use that word "biological."

751
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:32,040
 It depends on what evidence you judge. There are leaked documents. I consider them legitimate

752
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:37,600
 by and large. These are housed. One of the witnesses here, Dr. Robert Wood, is one of

753
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,760
 the individuals who has discussed them. They are called the majestic documents. If you

754
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:48,120
 take them at face value, it has been known since very early on, since the 1940s, that

755
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,920
 there are other entities that are here, extraterrestrial biological entities.

756
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:56,800
 The crafts could have been Soviet. We would have leaked anything about the Soviets. The

757
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,040
 entity certainly could not have been Soviet. If they knew about that, they knew very early

758
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,080
 this was extraterrestrial. They had to.

759
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,920
 They had to. If they knew that, then they could have had a legitimate concern that this

760
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:11,840
 was made public, the public was going to panic. For the good of the public, they couldn't

761
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,800
 make it public. Is that a reasonable argument?

762
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,280
 World War II had just ended. The entire world was lying flat on its back, millions of homeless

763
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:23,240
 and hungry people. Everyone was just trying to get back to a sense of normalcy. I can

764
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:27,320
 only imagine how the US military would have responded to something this exotic dropping

765
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,280
 into their lap.

766
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,360
 If this is, in fact, the ideology, then there is some hope that they can now say, gee, we've

767
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:39,100
 been watching this for all these years. Obviously, you're not hostile. Yes, it is extraterrestrial.

768
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:43,560
 My opinion is that there will never ever be any momentum from the top to move this forward,

769
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,920
 but the good news is that they're not the only game in town. The fact is our society

770
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:52,280
 is changing as dramatically as it is, as rapidly as it is, and there will be something that

771
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:55,920
 will force their hand. I'm convinced of this and I think it will happen within a generation

772
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,320
 or less. At that point, that's when the battle for truth begins, not ends, because there

773
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:04,400
 will still be spin doctors and attempts. The CIA will never just walk away from the table

774
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:10,440
 just because we figure something out. They're not going to say, oh, here's all of our information.

775
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,920
 The battle will continue, but at least it will be out in the open.

776
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:13,920
 The gentleman's time is expired.

777
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:26,920
