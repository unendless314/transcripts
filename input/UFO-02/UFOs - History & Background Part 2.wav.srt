1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
 It's my distinct honor to once again administer the oath to our second panel of the first

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,120
 day of the citizen's hearing.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,000
 This panel will run until approximately 1245.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,480
 We'll have opening statements of 10 to 15 minutes maximum and then questions of five

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,640
 to seven minutes.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,960
 So Mr. Gillin, you've already shared the oath.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,840
 So it's your option whether to do it again, but if the rest of the panel could repeat

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,840
 after me.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:38,400
 I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth to the members of

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,640
 this committee today.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,940
 Thank you.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,400
 We are for the second time this morning honored to begin with Mr. Dolman.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,680
 My goodness.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,660
 Thank you, esteemed members of the committee, and I will keep my remarks a little more mercifully

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:04,120
 brief than the last time, and I apologize for not having this statement for you.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,320
 I will provide that for you for the record before we're done here.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,920
 I just want to point out that researchers of UFO phenomenon have long argued with each

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,400
 other over many aspects of this phenomenon, but one conclusion that I think all of us

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,280
 share, at least serious research, is that the UFOs have become a central, although covert,

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,640
 but essential component of U.S. history in the modern era and indeed of world history.

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,200
 But as everyone knows, you can't have much of a history that is a reliable, factually

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,560
 based history without access to documents, and it's the documents of the past that enable

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,440
 us in the present to try to puzzle through the complexities and to find solid ground,

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,320
 as it were.

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,160
 And yet it's easy for us to forget that access to most of the key UFO documents we now have

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,520
 came to us by way of historical accident, and it happened to be a fleeting one at that.

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,080
 All through the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s and well into the 1970s, there were many thousands

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,140
 of classified pages written about UFOs.

29
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,720
 Of course the general public didn't know about this, and neither, it appears, did many or

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,080
 maybe even most members of Congress.

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,480
 But then came the end of the war in Vietnam and, of course, Watergate.

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,720
 And this was a certain key moment in American history, a moment in which the United States

33
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:47,420
 Congress investigated the intelligence community, for example, and when it reopened the investigation

34
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,160
 of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and

35
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
 others.

36
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,200
 And it was a moment in which Congress dramatically strengthened the United States Freedom of

37
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,240
 Information Act, enabling U.S. citizens to petition their government for documents not

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,480
 merely relating to them personally but to the nation in terms of broad issues of public

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
 policy.

40
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,920
 Well, little did members of Congress realize that of all subsequent Freedom of Information

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,580
 Act requests, the most popular category would be related to UFOs.

42
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:31,280
 And indeed, during the late 1970s, over 10,000 pages of documents relating to UFOs were released.

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,080
 The party lasted until about 1982 when a presidential order by Ronald Reagan made FOIA substantially

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,280
 less user friendly and did not require many agencies to reply in a timely manner at all.

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,720
 The result was a major ballooning in costs to those people making requests.

46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,400
 So the glory era of Freedom of Information documents, at least pertaining to UFOs, came

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,160
 to an end.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,480
 To this day, more than half of all U.S. declassified UFO documents come from that period of time,

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,960
 over 30 years ago.

50
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,340
 Great for the Carter administration, shame on the subsequent ones.

51
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,600
 And yet we remain fortunate, I think, because the documents that we have, thank goodness,

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,540
 give us at least enough.

53
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,200
 They give us enough of a history to hold on to.

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
 They give us enough solid ground.

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,720
 And their aggregate message is startlingly clear.

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,800
 UFOs have been the subject not merely of interest to our nation's military and intelligence

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,680
 community, but at times a subject of concern and even alarm.

58
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,120
 But how could it be otherwise when we have report after report of violations of sensitive

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,360
 airspace by objects that defy any logical or conventional explanation, whether the scene

60
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:05,400
 was Los Alamos during 1948 and 1949, or Oak Ridge Laboratories from 1948 through much

61
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:13,240
 of the 1950s, or the many military bases during the 50s, 60s, and 70s that reported such events.

62
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,760
 The question remains, how could this not be a matter of grave concern to those parties

63
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,240
 responsible for maintaining the integrity of their airspace?

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,160
 And not surprisingly, we find the tone of their memos and requests for information to

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,560
 be appropriate to the matter at hand.

66
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,600
 Here's one CIA memo from 1949, puts the matter in this very succinct way, quote, "Information

67
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:47,520
 is desired if this was some new or experimental aircraft or for any explanation whatsoever."

68
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,320
 And these statements are, in fact, typical.

69
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,920
 And the situation became so stressful to the CIA and elsewhere that on December 2nd, 1952,

70
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:03,360
 this is right at the very end of the Truman presidency, the CIA's chief of scientific

71
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,400
 intelligence, H. Marshall Chadwell, wrote a classified memo to his boss, that was the

72
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,280
 director of the CIA, Walter Betel Smith.

73
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,840
 And a key paragraph in this memo is as follows.

74
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:28,280
 At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must

75
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,200
 have immediate attention.

76
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,280
 Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in

77
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,920
 the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable

78
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,200
 to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles, end quote.

79
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,000
 I think this is a statement that bears very close scrutiny.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,720
 Here is yet another comment by a high-level U.S. official that UFOs were real, probably

81
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:13,360
 artificial, probably intelligently operated, and not apparently ours.

82
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,800
 And nor was there serious consideration that these were Soviet.

83
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,440
 So I would ask, if not American, if not Soviet, if not natural phenomena, and if they appeared

84
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,800
 to be technological and under intelligent control, well, we begin to run out of viable

85
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,920
 options.

86
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,880
 It is access to documents such as these that enable us to know with certainty that UFOs

87
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:47,600
 were a matter of serious concern to individuals at the highest levels of U.S. national security.

88
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,760
 I would want to stress that I don't think any of the formally declassified documents

89
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,360
 we have by themselves prove that UFOs are ET.

90
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,600
 I don't think any of them do.

91
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:05,200
 But I would argue that if you take the top 50, even the top 10, that they make a very

92
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,880
 powerful case, I would say not even a matter of speculation but a matter of proof that

93
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:19,200
 the phenomenon was considered real by the responsible members of our national security

94
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,400
 community.

95
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,200
 That I would say is not a matter of debate or speculation.

96
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,980
 And really the questions that we need to ask is why were they considering it, and did they

97
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,960
 form any opinions themselves?

98
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,600
 Getting at that answer is a little more difficult.

99
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,080
 But nonetheless, the bottom line is these documents do prove this.

100
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,680
 And it's important because all of these levels of concern were consistently voiced within

101
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,560
 the classified world, but they were not given out publicly all through the '40s and '50s.

102
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,720
 Right up to our own era, the formal public statements are always the same, that there's

103
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,800
 nothing to this, that it may be interesting or may not, but we're not interested in it.

104
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,880
 We don't do UFOs.

105
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:06,440
 And fortunately, as the historical accident of freedom of information turned out, those

106
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,880
 documents proved the lie to those statements of denial.

107
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,940
 So today, official pronouncements about UFOs by the government and military follows the

108
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,120
 exact same tone.

109
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,440
 There's really no difference between what they say now and what they said 50 years ago,

110
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,000
 except they're a little less insulting about it.

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,720
 Like in the early years, there were a number of statements that talked about people just

112
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,920
 kind of being crazy, psychopathological, that you don't hear that anymore.

113
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,640
 But other than that, it's really the same type of tone.

114
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,720
 Unfortunately, though, that we don't have the kind of access to classified information

115
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,520
 on UFOs as we once briefly obtained in the past.

116
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,400
 And yet, enough genuine and recent UFO accounts have become known to us, many of which involve

117
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,840
 US military, that we can see that very little has changed.

118
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,000
 Something important is happening behind the veil of the classified world.

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,520
 My question to you is, how long will current members of Congress and the public at large

120
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:18,360
 be content to roll over and be spoon-fed nonsense by responsible officials when in fact they

121
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
 deserve the truth?

122
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
 Thank you.

123
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:40,280
 Good afternoon, or good morning, distinguished members and panelists of the Citizen Hearing

124
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,200
 on Unidentified Flying Objects, UFOs.

125
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,960
 My name is Jose Antonio Neus, and I'm a Chilean-American journalist who has been actively involved

126
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:56,560
 in covering the mystery of UFOs and its hypothesis of extraterrestrial ET origin.

127
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,300
 Other theories are also possible and should be considered for the past 37 years.

128
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:09,080
 My very first article on this topic was published in a small New York newspaper on July 4, 1977,

129
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,080
 coinciding with the beginning of my professional career as a journalist in the United States.

130
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,640
 I was born in this country, but my family was from Chile.

131
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,000
 My father worked for several years in the United Nations in the early formative years

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,920
 of this international body, during which time I was born in New York in 1950.

133
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,380
 After graduating from high school in Santiago in 1969, I went to Europe and took a semester

134
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,500
 on French language and civilization at the Sorbonne University in Paris, and later studied

135
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,040
 journalism at the University of Chile in Santiago.

136
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,120
 I worked for a while as a science journalist for a weekly magazine in Santiago and also

137
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,560
 wrote regularly for a daily newspaper in the mid-70s, where I was one of the first journalists

138
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,840
 in Chile to cover ecological or green issues on a regular basis.

139
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,560
 This was, however, a period of great turmoil in Chile following the military coup of September

140
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,120
 11, 1973, the first time that fateful date shows up in modern history.

141
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,080
 I might add, so I took the decision to claim my U.S. citizenship and move to this country

142
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,440
 where I have lived ever since.

143
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,300
 First in the Washington, D.C. area, then New York for some 25 years, back to the Beltway

144
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,200
 where I lived in Northern Virginia for about three years, and now the Phoenix, Arizona

145
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,240
 area where I moved in 2009 after I was hired to work as a full-time paid journalist and

146
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,680
 editor of Open Minds magazine and also a writer for our website, Open Minds.TV, and other

147
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,640
 production and research activities in ufology for the company Open Minds Production.

148
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,760
 The subject of UFOs is a contentious one where many different views and attitudes coexist,

149
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,440
 sometimes in a friendly manner, sometimes in a more atrimonious way.

150
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,040
 But there is no doubt in my mind that there is at least one conclusion we can and should

151
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,320
 all agree, UFOs are definitely a global phenomenon.

152
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,840
 They're cited visually, on film, and on radar, reported, investigated sometimes officially,

153
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,280
 sometimes by private organizations, and covered by both the local and international media

154
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,200
 all over the world.

155
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,280
 It doesn't really matter what is the culture, language, religion, ethnic origin, and level

156
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,040
 of development and technological capabilities of a country.

157
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,560
 UFOs have been reported everywhere, from Alaska to Chile and Argentina and the Americas, all

158
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,880
 over Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and the oceans.

159
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,920
 There are well-documented cases in many parts of the world, including Brazil, France, Iran,

160
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,120
 Russia, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, and many other countries.

161
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,600
 Regardless of what turns out to be the final origin of this mystery, it has a great potential

162
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,160
 of unifying the different and often divided parts of our world.

163
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,880
 The reason is simple.

164
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,200
 No matter how big our ideological, religious, or cultural differences are, we would all

165
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,180
 tend to unite in the face of an unknown, possibly extraterrestrial presence.

166
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,440
 It is for this reason that some efforts have been made over the years to bring the subject

167
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,720
 to the attention of the United Nations Organization.

168
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,400
 This international body, despite its flaws, is the only organization that truly represents

169
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,980
 all the nations of the world, and so it seems to be the logical place where this issue could

170
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,240
 be dealt with in a global, formal, and legal manner.

171
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,200
 I will outline briefly the history of UFOs at the United Nations, a subject that I know

172
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,600
 very well firsthand since I personally attended as a journalist the famous historical UFO

173
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:05,120
 hearing before the UN Special Political Committee on November 27, 1978.

174
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,560
 This was the result of a two-year lobbying effort by Sir Eric Gehry, the Prime Minister

175
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,900
 of Grenada, a small Caribbean island which had gained independence from Great Britain

176
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,080
 in 1978.

177
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,720
 I'm submitting for the record a long article detailing the history of UFOs at the UN, which

178
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,940
 I published in the third issue of Open Minds Magazine in 2010.

179
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:37,920
 Grenada's UFO proposal was first raised officially by Prime Minister Gehry and Grenada's UN Ambassador

180
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,880
 Wellington Friday at a meeting of the UN General Assembly Special Political Committee on November

181
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,880
 28, 1977.

182
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,640
 Grenada proposed the, quote, "establishment of an agency or a department of the United

183
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,360
 Nations for undertaking, coordinating, and disseminating the results of research into

184
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,600
 unidentified flying objects, UFOs, and related phenomena."

185
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,560
 Grenada made further statements on November 30 and December 6, 1977.

186
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,160
 In an earlier speech in October, Prime Minister Gehry disclosed his own sighting, quote, "I

187
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,520
 have myself seen an unidentified flying object, and I have been totally overwhelmed by what

188
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
 I have seen."

189
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:31,720
 As a result of all this effort, on December 13, 1977, the General Assembly adopted decision

190
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:40,560
 32/424, which acknowledged the draft resolution submitted by Grenada.

191
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:48,160
 Secretary General Kurt Baalheim duly forwarded decision 32/424 to the member states by a

192
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,120
 note verbal on March 13, 1978.

193
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,000
 However, only three governments responded, India, Luxembourg, and Seychelles, and only

194
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,200
 two specialized agencies, International Civil Aviation Organization and UNESCO, replied

195
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,160
 with a flat, "No comments to offer."

196
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,440
 On the 3rd, Grenada launched a new offensive in 1978 with the help of one of the original

197
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,960
 NASA astronauts, Gordon Cooper, among others.

198
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:24,000
 A group of recognized experts was assembled by Gehry to testify at a hearing before the

199
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,040
 Special Political Committee on November 27, 1978, which became the high point of the Grenada

200
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
 initiative.

201
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,440
 Besides Sir Eric Gehry and Ambassador Friday, who was now Grenada's Minister of Education,

202
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,760
 the hearing included testimony by astronomer Dr. J. Alan Hynek, the former scientific

203
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,600
 consultant for the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book, who went on to found the Center

204
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,080
 for UFO Studies, CUFOS; Dr. Jacques Vallee, Stanton Friedman, who was present at the citizen

205
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,560
 hearing; and a firsthand witness account by Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence Coyne of the U.S.

206
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:09,720
 Army Reserve on the famous October 18, 1973, UFO helicopter near collision in Ohio; a letter

207
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,320
 of endorsement by astronaut Gordon Cooper, who was then working for the Walt Disney Company

208
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,440
 as Vice President of Research and Development for Epcot, was read into the record.

209
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,920
 Besides mentioning his own sighting and views on UFOs, Cooper wrote that, "We need to have

210
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,900
 a top-level coordinated program to scientifically collect and analyze data from all over Earth

211
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:41,500
 concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interface with these visitors

212
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,000
 in a friendly fashion."

213
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,280
 At a meeting of the UN General Assembly on December 18, 1978, Decision 33/426 was adopted

214
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,840
 with the same heading to the previous Decision 32/424, establishment of an agency or a Department

215
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,600
 of the United Nations for undertaking, coordinating, and disseminating the results of research

216
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,880
 into unidentified flying objects and related phenomena."

217
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,080
 The Grenada Initiative was gradually opening the door to UFOs at the UN, but unfortunately

218
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,960
 the effort came to an abrupt halt when the Gary government was overthrown by a Marxist

219
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,920
 revolution led by Maurice Bishop of the New Jewel movement in March 1979.

220
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:37,720
 Ironically, Gary was in New York to meet with Kurt Valheim regarding Decision 33/426 when

221
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,560
 the coup took place.

222
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,080
 Some minor efforts to rekindle the UFO initiative at the United Nations were attempted by civilian

223
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:53,580
 investigators since the Grenada coup of 1979, but with no success whatsoever, because only

224
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,360
 sovereign member country can bring this issue back officially to the UN, and no government

225
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,560
 has done so since the Grenada Initiative of the late 70s.

226
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,680
 The good news, however, is that we don't have to reinvent the wheel.

227
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:16,240
 The UN Decisions 32/424 and 33/426 are already on the books and could be revived if there

228
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,280
 was political will.

229
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,060
 In closing these opening remarks, I want to make a few important points.

230
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,860
 While it's true that the majority of UFO sightings have mundane explanations, a fact recognized

231
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,360
 by most competent investigators and scientists, if you really study with an open mind the

232
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,320
 extensive data bank of UFO cases collected worldwide during the last six decades, you

233
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:48,280
 will find a small percentage of truly puzzling incidents that defy any conventional explanation.

234
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,920
 The prevailing view among most researchers and the media is that these cases have an

235
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,640
 ET origin, but this is not the only explanation.

236
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,280
 Other theories, including interdimensional or multiple universes, have also been advanced.

237
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,400
 Even time travel has been proposed.

238
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,880
 In other words, UFOs would be our own devices from the future coming back in time for unknown

239
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
 reasons.

240
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,520
 I realize all this sounds like science fiction, but think for a minute.

241
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,680
 Didn't you see people talking to each other at huge distances while viewing themselves

242
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,080
 on a screen in lots of sci-fi movies from the 50s and 60s?

243
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,360
 Well, this happens now every day through Skype and the internet.

244
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,360
 Similar examples can be multiplied at infinitum.

245
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,960
 What is important is to look at all the data without any preconceived ideas or beliefs.

246
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:47,040
 The late Dr. Hynek used to say that UFOs were likely signaling the next scientific revolution.

247
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,320
 But we will never get there if we don't study the phenomenon in a truly comprehensive and

248
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,120
 unbiased way, and I might add, with the proper resources to do so.

249
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:04,520
 The political implications, or exopolitical as it's now referred, are even bigger.

250
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,160
 The alien can become a catalyst to unify the peoples of Earth to realize that mankind must

251
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,360
 grow way beyond our current limitations if we are going to survive and prosper in the

252
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,040
 future.

253
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:23,720
 Many believe that open contact will never happen in an open way unless mankind's level

254
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,080
 of consciousness makes a significant jump.

255
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,160
 Let me finish with an appropriate quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet, "There are more things

256
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,560
 in heaven and earth, Horatio, that are dreamt in your philosophy."

257
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,480
 Thank you very much.

258
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,800
 Good morning.

259
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,080
 Good morning, congressmen and congressmen and Senator Ravel.

260
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,760
 My name is Dan Sheehan.

261
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,760
 I am general counsel for the committee.

262
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,800
 I've been asked to speak briefly here today to address a few different instances that

263
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:09,160
 have occurred in my career as an attorney that bear upon this particular subject that

264
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,160
 have led to me ending up being general counsel.

265
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:19,060
 I was also general counsel for the original disclosure conference that we had in 2001.

266
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:27,640
 So I've been around for a while on this particular area and it arose because I was chief counsel

267
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,760
 for the United States Jesuit headquarters in Washington, D.C. here back in 1976 when President

268
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,920
 Carter was elected president.

269
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,980
 And immediately after his election in November of 1976, President Carter called into his

270
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:53,280
 office the then central intelligence agency director, who was George H.W. Bush.

271
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,800
 And President Carter asked to be briefed by the director of central intelligence on the

272
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,600
 issue of UFOs.

273
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,920
 And in that meeting, CIA Director Bush asked the president-elect if the president-elect

274
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,540
 would leave him in as the central intelligence agency director and that he would promise

275
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,360
 that he would never run for political office in his life if Carter would agree to keep

276
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,200
 him in as the director of the CIA.

277
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,520
 Bush wanted to, at that time, become more or less like J. Edgar Hoover had become at

278
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,640
 the FBI, that he would remain, that it would be above politics, that he would remain in

279
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,120
 that position.

280
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,900
 President Carter reiterated his request for the UFO information, saying that he had his

281
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,560
 own person in mind to be the director of the central intelligence agency, which happened

282
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,280
 to be Teddy Sorensen at the time.

283
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,640
 And Bush at that time then refused to provide the information to him, saying that he did

284
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,120
 not have adequate clearances, he was not the president yet, and that he should ask his

285
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,640
 own central intelligence agency director for that.

286
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,040
 But if he wanted to have the information ahead of time, that what he could do is he could

287
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,880
 contact the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Representatives, and they

288
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,960
 had an ongoing relationship with the Science and Technology Division of the Congressional

289
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,200
 Research Service that could go about getting things declassified to show him.

290
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,600
 That is what generated the request from the Congressional Research Service to me as the

291
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,500
 general counsel for the Jesuit headquarters in the United States, asking if I could gain

292
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:41,000
 access to the Vatican Library to obtain the information that the Vatican has in its library

293
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,280
 in its classified sections to deliver to the president for his review.

294
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
 I did that.

295
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:54,000
 I contacted the Jesuit, who happens to be the head of the Vatican Library, requesting

296
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 this information.

297
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,680
 And much to my surprise, I was denied information.

298
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,280
 I wrote a second letter to them saying, "Look, I guess you must not know who we are here.

299
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,700
 This is the Jesuit headquarters in the United States.

300
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,680
 We have 10 provinces here in the United States, more than any other country in the world,

301
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,440
 and we're requesting this information to share with the president."

302
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,200
 They still declined.

303
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,100
 So I had to report that to Marcia Smith, who was the head of the Science and Technology

304
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,900
 Division of the Library of Congress Congressional Research Service, and she asked if I would

305
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,080
 be willing to become counsel, special counsel, to this investigation that was being conducted

306
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,640
 by the Science and Technology Committee.

307
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,720
 I agreed to do this, and I told her that I would need to have access to certain kinds

308
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,240
 of information, that I would like to have declassified or get to see it.

309
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,720
 And she said, "What would you like to see?"

310
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,560
 And I said, "Well, the first thing I'd like to see is the classified sections of Project

311
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:59,120
 Blue Book, those sections that have been referred to by Mr. Dolan earlier and by Gordon as not

312
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,220
 really available."

313
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,940
 Because to our surprise, I was granted permission to see them.

314
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,080
 And they brought them to Washington, and they brought them over to the Jefferson Building,

315
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,400
 the extension, to the Congressional Library before it was even open, the brand new building

316
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,640
 that they built across the street.

317
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,360
 And so I was invited to come over there.

318
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,360
 I went over there.

319
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,760
 No one else was in the building.

320
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,760
 They had security people at the door, and I went over, and I was brought downstairs

321
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:34,680
 into a room where they had these shoeboxes with microfilm in them and documents, et cetera.

322
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:41,800
 And in my review of those documents, I came upon photographs of unquestioned UFOs.

323
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,440
 It wasn't any question about what they were.

324
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,040
 It wasn't a light in the sky.

325
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,960
 It wasn't a vague report about having seen something going very fast by.

326
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,880
 These were photographs, official United States Air Force photographs, some taken through

327
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,080
 gun sights, but another one of a crashed saucer on the ground, that there was snow in the

328
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
 photographs.

329
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,800
 It showed that the saucer had hit into a field and had plowed across the field and was stuck

330
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,000
 into a snowbank, set up about a 45-degree angle.

331
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,120
 And I could see in the photographs U.S. Air Force personnel dressed in heavy parkas taking

332
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,920
 actually film with those two cameras with the great big camera circles on top, the films

333
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,560
 like this, so it must have been in the 1950s.

334
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:37,400
 And I saw this, and I realized that I could see in one of the photographs symbols that

335
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,480
 were on the dome of the UFO sticking in the snowbank.

336
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,640
 So what I did, I had one of those, they were the microfiche, those little machines you

337
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,880
 put the microfiche in, you crank the little handle, very high-tech this was.

338
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,520
 And so what I did is they had told me that I wasn't allowed to take any notes when I

339
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
 went in there.

340
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,980
 The two security men at the door told me I was not allowed to take any notes, but I actually

341
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,160
 had a yellow pad under my arm when I went in like this, and so when I went in and when

342
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:19,600
 I saw these photographs, what I did is I cranked down the focus on the machine so that I could

343
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,360
 get a close-up view of these symbols that were around the dome of the UFO, and what

344
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,000
 I did is I opened up the yellow pad and I put the yellow pad in there and I traced the

345
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,360
 actual symbols that were along the base of the saucer, and then I closed it up and I

346
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,740
 said, "I think I'd probably better leave now because I have this."

347
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,680
 So what I did is I put all this stuff back into the boxes and I put the yellow pad under

348
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,720
 my arm and I walked back out, and the two security guys said, "I'd like my briefcase

349
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
 back."

350
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,960
 They handed me my briefcase and I started to walk away, and one of them says, "What's

351
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,720
 that under your arm?"

352
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,760
 And I said, "Oh, this is a yellow pad," and he opened it up and he leafed through all

353
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,400
 the pages and there was nothing there, because I had put it on the inside of the cardboard.

354
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,000
 And so I took that back with me to Jesuit headquarters and I brought it to Father Bill

355
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,840
 Davis, who was my superior at the Jesuit headquarters, and we then agreed to go.

356
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,360
 We gathered all 54 of the major religious denominations.

357
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,240
 They're Washington, D.C. offices, and we brought them into a meeting and we proposed to them

358
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,840
 from the Jesuit national headquarters that we establish as a priority having the churches

359
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,400
 try to ascertain what information we could get, and that we would get the backing of

360
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,440
 the churches and then go to the Vatican Library and see if we could start to address this.

361
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:49,880
 Now, that is what we did, and Father Bill Davis, when I asked him this, he got puzzled

362
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,760
 and he reached down and he pulled open the drawer out of his desk at the Jesuit headquarters

363
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,480
 right over by DuPont Circle, 1717 Mass Ave is where we were, and he opened up the drawer

364
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,760
 and he pulled out a photograph, and he said, "This is a photograph that I got from my sister.

365
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:13,520
 Her husband is in the tower in the Seattle, Washington airport.

366
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:19,000
 He's a flight controller and his best friend is a commercial pilot, and he took this photograph

367
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,360
 out of his window of the commercial airline, and he handed me the photograph of this."

368
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,080
 We showed this to the people at the Washington Interreligious Staff Council that we organized,

369
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,880
 asking them if they would make this a priority, and they said, "Are there any other subjects

370
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,440
 you'd like to discuss?"

371
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,960
 Instead of that.

372
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,000
 They didn't want to address that at that time, and what happened, I was contacted then by

373
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,040
 Marsha Smith, who was directing the investigation for President Carter at the Congressional

374
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:55,880
 Research Service, and she asked me if I would go to meet with the people at the Jet Propulsion

375
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,480
 Laboratory in California in the SETI Program, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

376
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,640
 and give them a briefing on the theological implications of contact with extraterrestrial

377
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,120
 intelligence.

378
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,280
 I was privileged to deliver a three-hour seminar to the top 50 scientists in the SETI Program

379
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:21,640
 on the theological implications of contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence.

380
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,300
 Then in 1994, I was contacted by Dr. John Mack, who was the chairman of the Department

381
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,160
 of Clinical Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, because I had graduated from Harvard

382
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,000
 College and graduated from Harvard Law School, where I was one of the founders of the Harvard

383
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,720
 Civil Rights Law Review, and I had gone on to Harvard Divinity School.

384
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,480
 He contacted me and asked me if I would represent him, because he had written a book based upon

385
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,440
 his clinical assistance to high-level military officials and others in the country who had

386
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,640
 been sent to have psychological background done on them, who had reported these direct

387
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,760
 contacts with extraterrestrial vehicles of this kind.

388
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,040
 When I met with him, he had written this book, and the faculty committee at Harvard University

389
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:15,540
 had called him into a session with the legal counsel from Harvard University and the head

390
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:21,720
 of the dean of the medical school, getting ready to challenge his tenure for his having

391
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:28,040
 written this book, that it was undermining the worldview of Harvard University.

392
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,740
 We met with Lawrence Rockefeller, and Lawrence Rockefeller agreed to fund what would really

393
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,000
 amount to grand rounds to present to the Harvard faculty all of the basic information that

394
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,840
 we had on the existence of UFOs.

395
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,760
 They then dropped the hearings and said they didn't want to have these hearings turned

396
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,680
 into a circus.

397
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:57,200
 Now those were my initial contacts with them, and so I have delivered a number of presentations

398
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,740
 to the International UFO Congress over the years on the theological implications of contact

399
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,480
 with an extraterrestrial civilization.

400
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,500
 As you may know, the Vatican has now started to issue press statements.

401
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,200
 They actually held a major press conference talking about the fact that in light of the

402
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,640
 more recent discoveries of the increasing number of planets that they now realize have

403
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,960
 suns and atmosphere and are in what they call the Goldilocks zone.

404
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,420
 They're close enough to their planet, their sun and their solar systems, but not so far

405
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,720
 away that they're likely to have potential life on them.

406
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,360
 As these planets began to multiply, the Vatican has now held an official press conference

407
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:48,600
 announcing that they in fact have now taken the position that the discovery of extraterrestrial

408
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:55,280
 intelligence in a highly technologically developed intelligence is not inconsistent with Catholic

409
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,920
 theology.

410
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,480
 That is what is going on right now.

411
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,680
 There are very high level meetings going on right now with the new pope to discuss what

412
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,560
 positions are going to be taken by the International Catholic Church with regard to the theology.

413
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,920
 My understanding is as former chief council for the Jesuits that the fact is that the

414
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,280
 Catholic Church does not want to be behind the power curve on this issue.

415
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,800
 They realize that with the increasing contact and discovery of these additional planets

416
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,060
 that it's going to become clear within our generation, within our lifetimes that in fact

417
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,680
 highly technologically developed extraterrestrial intelligence actually exists.

418
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,340
 The findings of the Congressional Research Service that were delivered to President Carter

419
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,720
 is that based upon all of their analysis that they have come to the conclusion, this is

420
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,960
 an official conclusion of the Congressional Research Service, that they have come to a

421
00:35:51,960 --> 00:36:00,600
 95% probability projection that there are from 2 to 10 highly technologically developed

422
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,320
 extraterrestrial civilizations within our own galaxy.

423
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:12,760
 Now, remember in closing, there in our galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, there are 50 billion

424
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:24,720
 star systems in our galaxy and there are 50 billion trillion galaxies that are now known.

425
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,120
 The question and the abiding question and it's the one that you and I discussed last

426
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:34,720
 night, Congressman Bartlett, have these vehicles developed the capacity to transport vehicles

427
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,440
 beyond the speed of light?

428
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,560
 Because if they have, then all these questions now become focused, that that means that they

429
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,520
 would be able to be here, come here and go and if they have, then all of these sightings

430
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,380
 that we've talked about, all these hundreds of witnesses that we've talked about, then

431
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,760
 are talking about a very real phenomenon.

432
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:01,880
 I'll close with this one observation, when I was legal counsel for the Iran-Contra investigations,

433
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,520
 that we were the ones that actually initially discovered the Iran-Contra weapons supply

434
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,860
 trafficking, and when I delivered this information to Peter Rodino, who was at the time the chair

435
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,800
 of the Judiciary Committee of the House, through Scott Armstrong, Scott Armstrong, as you'll

436
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,520
 recall, was the staff person on Rodino's staff of the Judiciary Committee during the Watergate

437
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:28,120
 investigations, who discovered the taping system in the White House that Alexander Butterfield

438
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,800
 revealed this to Scott.

439
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,360
 So I went and brought this information to him, and because of his close relationship

440
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,440
 with Peter Rodino, he delivered all of the information we had about the off-the-shelf

441
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,640
 enterprise, the involvement of Poindexter and everyone else, and the response of Peter

442
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,680
 Rodino was, he said, "Scott," he said, "my God," he said, "if what you're telling me is

443
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,320
 true about this off-the-shelf enterprise going on, delivering these weapons contrary to the

444
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,000
 orders of Congress, why then," he said, "I've been telling my constituencies that they didn't

445
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,240
 like the way that American policy was going, that they should write a letter to their congressperson,

446
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,160
 and if their congressperson didn't do what they wanted them to do, you should vote for

447
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,600
 someone else for Congress, but if what you're telling me is true, Scott, my God, we haven't

448
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,040
 even been in control.

449
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,600
 I'm not going to allow the Congress of the United States to investigate anything like

450
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:25,560
 that." And that's the issue that's before us now, because if, in fact, we're not in

451
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,400
 ultimate control, and there is an extraterrestrial intelligence of this type of sophistication

452
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,640
 that's been visiting our planet and entering our airspace and outmaneuvering our aircraft,

453
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,920
 it's perfectly clear that from a political consciousness that abides inside our executive

454
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,640
 branch and inside our legislature, that is not something that they want to share with

455
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,600
 the American people, because it would ultimately undermine the confidence of the governed in

456
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,600
 their governors.

457
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:13,960
 [applause]

458
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,320
 My name is Lieutenant Colonel Richard French. I am one of the writers of the original Air

459
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:27,320
 Force Blue Book. I was a student at Oregon State starting in 1947, and in my junior year

460
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,880
 I was asked what specialty I wanted to be assigned when I graduated. An advisor told

461
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,440
 me about the Office of Special Investigations. It sounded like an exciting and glamorous job,

462
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:47,440
 so I volunteered. Brigadier General Carroll, a former FBI director of the Washington District,

463
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,720
 was commissioned as an Air Force general and assumed command of the OSI.

464
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:03,560
 The OSI of course was also given the added responsibility of investigating the phenomenon

465
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,480
 of unidentified flying objects. The OSI assignment required that I have final top secret clearance

466
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,320
 granted before I could even report for duty. That caused a delay in my reporting because

467
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:23,320
 I in fact am adopted and all of my medical and birth records and all that are sealed.

468
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,440
 Every year they straighten out that mess, and I reported to DO-20 at McCord Air Force

469
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,120
 Base Washington. There my training officer was a special agent named John Drahos. Under

470
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:44,120
 his supervision I began investigating UFO reports and recording the incidents in the

471
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,400
 Air Force's Blue Book.

472
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,400
 The most controversial UFO incident that occurred in my early training deserves special mention

473
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:00,840
 because of its unique factor. An F-100D pilot, the Ds, they'd launch them normally just

474
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:13,560
 in twos rather than fours like tactical fighters. Anyway, he pulled up on this UFO and it was

475
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,960
 approximately 30 yards directly behind the thing. The F-86 today carries a total of 36

476
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 two and a half inch, or two and a half, let me get this straight, carries 36 of those

477
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:40,040
 two and a half inch rockets and they're carried in a pod that drops and it drops and automatically

478
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:47,280
 fires when it comes down. Well, he got the clearance to fire which kind of surprised

479
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,280
 everybody and he blew that UFO out of the sky, but the problem is that the recording

480
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:10,160
 of the incident, well, let me get this exactly right, the UFO intercept violated the prohibited

481
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,160
 zone at Hanford's Atomic Energy Facility. He was a wingman and pulled up straight ahead

482
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,560
 and it was given a clearance to fire. When the weapon fired, the pod dropped, but his

483
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,560
 airplane exploded. They drugged the Colorado River, I mean the Columbia River in a 60 mile

484
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:39,600
 area and they never found a piece or part or anything even pertaining to it. I mentioned

485
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:50,680
 that I had just a very fast look at the magic report. I hope you people are familiar with

486
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,080
 it, but if you're not, it is the original report that was prepared. President Truman

487
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,440
 was the chairman. The people who were on that committee and I just did just get a very quick

488
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:09,440
 look at it, but I could easily remember who they were because of who they were. They included

489
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:15,840
 the chiefs of the president of course and also the chiefs of staff of all of the armed

490
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:22,240
 forces, arms of the United States. In other words, the chief of naval operations and the

491
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:29,240
 head of the Coast Guard and on and on. That terminates my presentation.

492
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:46,720
 We have about 10 minutes for each member of the six of you and that will take us to 1250.

493
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,760
 I've been asked by both the chair and the co-chair to give time reminders as we're approaching

494
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,480
 that 10 minute limit for each of you, so I'll do that as gently as possible.

495
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,320
 My understanding is that there will be time cue cards visible to the panelists here and

496
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:07,760
 to the members back here. We will watch those and time ourselves. I remember a number of

497
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,680
 years ago I was traveling in a car and had my car radio on and there were two news accounts.

498
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,680
 One was that there were some UFO sightings over New Mexico and the other was that there

499
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,800
 had been two mysterious deaths in New York City that might have been cyticosis and if

500
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,660
 it was cyticosis it might have come from dried pigeon manure, so it was a serious suggestion

501
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:37,920
 that maybe we ought to kill all the pigeons in New York. I listened to those two newscasts

502
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,920
 and I thought, gee, if these flying saucers are extraterrestrial I think I'd wander around

503
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:49,920
 a bit up there and watch for a while yet before I landed. As I said when we started this it

504
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:57,720
 is really enormously arrogant and presumptive to believe that we're the most advanced civilization

505
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,400
 in the universe. We still fight stupid wars and kill each other. There just has to be

506
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:10,400
 a better way, doesn't there. Again, I will reserve my question until the end. My co-chair.

507
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:21,160
 I wanted to mention one other thing. All of the time, and there's a period there that's

508
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:28,160
 about 12 years, but during that 12-year period my primary job as a member of the OSI was

509
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:34,360
 to debunk them. In other words, I'd come up with any kind of explanation. We'd say it

510
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:41,360
 was swamp gas or you name it, anything that we could come up with to apparently convince

511
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:49,480
 the general public and maintain the secrecy level on that. Some of my answers, I swear,

512
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 were observed. The swamp gas, for instance, at that time there was an average of about

513
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,880
 three a week UFOs had descended into the Gulf Breeze, Florida area, if you know where that

514
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:10,880
 is. It's just where the panhandle is in Florida. Anyway, I went down there and we observed

515
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,920
 them just regularly, just sit there every evening with a cocktail and in they'd come.

516
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:29,240
 But what was it? It was swamp gas. That was my lie and I made good on it. But that was

517
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:36,280
 my actual job, to be the most artful lawyer on earth.

518
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:45,280
 So Colonel French, you did a good job of it, obviously.

519
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:52,560
 So for all four of you, it's just starting to weigh on me. If transparency would reveal

520
00:46:52,560 --> 00:47:06,240
 that we really aren't in control, that there are actually as intelligent or more powerful

521
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:15,760
 than likely, more intelligent life form than humans, and that in so knowing and admitting

522
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:30,440
 would be dangerous, that's a closed circle, folks. So what do you recommend? How do you

523
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:38,640
 recommend we handle this? Let's start with the Colonel who won't tell us it's a gas

524
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,400
 form.

525
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:48,120
 Well, I see no other way to attack it than to come up with some kind of international

526
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:54,040
 organization, something along the line of what we already have in here, or some similar

527
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:01,040
 governmental way, and then putting those people, you know, because when you think about it,

528
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:08,920
 this confronts religion directly and very firmly. And we do need some type of organization,

529
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:18,480
 something that can hold us, if need be, to contact these people from another universe.

530
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,520
 And when they come, you know, it's a lot better if you say, "Hi, buddy," not try and shoot

531
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,200
 their tail end off.

532
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:34,200
 So, we're claiming my time to go on to you, Daniel. But let me add a piece to this now.

533
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:46,160
 Then how will the United States, for one, give up our rights as our national security

534
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,800
 rights if we went on to cooperate with the United Nations on this?

535
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:06,840
 Yes. This is a worldview issue. One of the things that I discovered after a number of

536
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,840
 years in practice, the reason I ended up going back to Harvard Divinity School to study after

537
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:17,840
 spending a number of years out practicing law, was that this is a worldview issue, that

538
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,400
 people don't think about this very often, but the reality is there's a spectrum of

539
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,480
 world views that are shared by our human family, the political manifestation of which, or the

540
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,480
 political philosophy of which, is you have people who are authoritarians, you have people

541
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,120
 who are reactionaries, you have people who are conservatives, you have people who are

542
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,600
 moderates, you have people who are liberals, you have people who are progressives, and

543
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,400
 then you have people who are basically what we refer to as utopianists, who tend to be

544
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,080
 theological, for the most part. But there's a whole eighth worldview. There's an octave

545
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,560
 of worldviews, and there's a new worldview that is in the offing right now, and that

546
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,720
 is the worldview that is going to have to be addressed by our human family once we come

547
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:06,480
 to acknowledge that there are, in fact, there's a super sophisticated, highly intelligent

548
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,320
 extraterrestrial civilization, and that there may be more than one of these species.

549
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,360
 Okay, I'm going to reclaim my time because I wanted to know how to break through this.

550
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,200
 It's a new worldview. We have to construct the new worldview.

551
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,760
 You're suggesting that we're going to take on a new worldview. If that's what it takes

552
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:31,560
 to happen, we're a long way from that. Mr. Juneyos.

553
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:39,080
 Well, every so often, things happen in the history of the world that change, that lead

554
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:45,600
 to a complete change, and that was the case when America was discovered, and it was called

555
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,320
 the New World, even though it was part of the same world. But at that time, it completely

556
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:58,200
 changed the paradigm of the late medieval period, and there was even discussions whether

557
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:04,440
 maybe the Earth paradise was in America, or whether the natives Americans had it sold.

558
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,760
 It was a whole kind of huge discussion, and eventually, obviously, we're here, so it worked

559
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:20,560
 out. Same thing when the atomic bomb was released, dropped in Japan. That changed the paradigm

560
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:28,360
 of that period. I think this is the next frontier, and I don't think it's going to be as difficult

561
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:37,640
 as it seems because we're conditioned already by the media and by the entertainment industry.

562
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:44,680
 Even when I started this business, such as we could call it a business, this beauty,

563
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:51,520
 many years ago, the attitude of people was very negative. Really, UFOs were considered

564
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:58,600
 like a cookie subject, and now, if you ask a young generation, for them, they say, "Well,

565
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:05,560
 what's the big deal?" It's obvious that there's life in the universe. I don't know exactly

566
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:13,180
 how it will happen, but it will, and we will have to adjust and move forward.

567
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:18,120
 I guess it's a good thing we have the entertainment industry to turn on people's imaginations.

568
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,120
 Richard?

569
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:23,880
 Yes. Thank you for this question. It's very important. I often think no parent is ever

570
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:30,200
 ready for their first child, but they happen anyway. Disclosure of this reality, we may

571
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,920
 or may not be ready for it. We probably won't be ready for it, frankly. I think that our

572
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,680
 society is going through such a tremendous revolution. This isn't 1990. It's certainly

573
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,760
 not 1950. We have capabilities today that I think are forcing this issue out. WikiLeaks

574
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,480
 didn't exist 10 years ago because it couldn't exist. It wasn't a global infrastructure.

575
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,840
 Cell phone cameras, all of this, this is all new. I think something's going to happen that's

576
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:59,800
 going to force this out front and center. My suspicion, I can only guess, is that those

577
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,400
 people who have knowledge on this, and I think there are such people, must be aware. They

578
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,440
 must be aware that they cannot keep this secret forever. I think the wisest thing to do would

579
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:15,440
 be judiciously and responsibly to begin allowing some of this information out. Maybe there

580
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,320
 are controlled leaks today. I do think that when this matter is out on the table, that

581
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,880
 doesn't mean all the answers will be there. It just means that we'll be able, publicly,

582
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:33,080
 without all the joking and ridicule, to be able to talk about it as a public policy issue.

583
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,560
 I also think that this will necessitate a geopolitical revolution. You mentioned the

584
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,560
 issues of U.S. national security. Well, there's other countries in the world, and they're

585
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:48,560
 all going to be affected by this. It will have to be necessary for there to be a true

586
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,240
 United Nations, something that actually works that people can believe in, because without

587
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:00,180
 that I think it's just going to be a big mess. Do I have any more time? Two minutes. The

588
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:07,160
 next discussion, I would like to go from, we're worried about airspace. How about cyberspace?

589
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:17,160
 May I make the comment at this? Basically, my background is I have more combat than virtually

590
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:23,520
 anyone you'll ever meet. I have more than 800 combat missions, 860 in jet fighters,

591
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,640
 so I'm not afraid of battle. Obviously not. I think the dumbest thing we could possibly

592
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:36,480
 do is weaponize space, and I've been in that argument several times, and it would be absurd

593
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:45,700
 to do that. Thank you. Thank you. Cyberspace. One minute. It's all we have. It's quite clear

594
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:51,160
 that the technology that seems to be at the disposal of this civilization is able to access,

595
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,160
 if the FBI can tap into your internet, then clearly they can too. So they're monitoring,

596
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,960
 undoubtedly monitoring all the communications that are going on, and I would dare say that

597
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:08,320
 there is a process going on of feathering into our culture, information, technology,

598
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:14,560
 et cetera, that is going to soften this blow, that there's a process going on of released

599
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:20,800
 information, of contact information, et cetera, and I find it based on 40 years of doing these

600
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:27,480
 kind of investigations of Watergate, Iran-Contra, and others that I've been directly involved

601
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,680
 in, that there's clearly going to be a decision made by very high level people above all of

602
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:37,720
 our pay grades here, I say with all due respect from Congress people, that there'll be a decision

603
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:42,200
 made to start feathering information into the culture to prepare our people for this

604
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:50,280
 rather gradually, which has been going on now for the last 60 years. I think we're finished.

605
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,280
 Thank you.

606
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,120
 Congresswoman Kilpatrick.

607
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,640
 Thank you very much. I think I want to start with the Colonel. I served on the Air Force

608
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:06,240
 Academy Board for about six years in my 12-year tenure, 14 years in Congress. Served on the

609
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,640
 Appropriations Defense Committee, first African-American woman ever to serve there. It's only been

610
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,160
 three in the history of our 2,000-year country. It's outrageous. We really believe that women

611
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:23,440
 have something to offer. So I really appreciate your service. We come from a "let's work this

612
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:29,260
 out" kind of thing, so we wouldn't have this problem when we control the world. But having

613
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:36,720
 said that, Colonel, I really appreciate your service, your time, your dedication. 800-plus.

614
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,880
 I've been all over the world with the Defense Department, and it's been quite an experience

615
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:49,440
 for me. It's really capitalized and captured my tenure in Congress, really. Why is it that

616
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,040
 when you were there, you couldn't talk about it? Everything I've read and seen, everybody

617
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,040
 hush-hushed it.

618
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,080
 Wait, let me do it. I want you to do the whole question. The whole question. I know a lot

619
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,520
 of it's from the presidential right on down to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of you all

620
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,640
 spoke to that. We didn't call it by that name, but that's kind of what it was that Truman

621
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,340
 had, exactly, as a matter of fact. Why is it now that you're at the table discussing

622
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,680
 it with us, acknowledging that it is?

623
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,400
 Probably it's because I'm in my 80s now.

624
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,120
 Praise God. Okay.

625
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:32,120
 Here's the problem. If you had a government job, you had to have, you need to be what

626
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:39,200
 they call humanly reliable. In other words, if they thought you were a maniac or something,

627
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:46,000
 you'd lose your wings, and lose your job, and so forth. Anyway, I think it's because

628
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,120
 of that, basically the human reliability problem, the fact that there are some real lunatics

629
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:00,840
 in various places, and you can't identify them well enough. Then they won't submit,

630
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:11,120
 and you have a problem next to kin. If they have a child that is ill mentally, what do

631
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,480
 you do?

632
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,000
 You believe today that, as you sit here with us and former members of Congress, 80 plus

633
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:24,360
 years of experience, having now before this committee, whose time has come, since 1968,

634
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,280
 there's been no hearing, as you know. We're moving to that. I don't know that the answer

635
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,600
 is another hearing right now. I'm afraid for that.

636
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,800
 I heard in this discussion this morning, there's a lot of private things going on. I like to

637
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,720
 see partnerships, private, public. I think that's when Americans get our best bet, when

638
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:47,000
 we come together as a nation in a private, public kind of atmosphere. When you talk about

639
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,320
 what you just said, and I agree that it's urgent, I think somebody at the table mentioned

640
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,080
 coming together and acknowledging it, which we haven't done as this country. Other countries

641
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:00,280
 are beginning to do that, and some were mentioned this morning. Do you think the Air Force will

642
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:08,480
 ever come to that point? Is it a domestic, international partnership that we need? How

643
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,000
 would you begin it? You come with the credibility.

644
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,280
 It's necessary, and I don't think we've got much choice. Something's got to be done.

645
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,080
 You all have to help us formulate that, too. I agree with that. Thank you very much for

646
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:27,080
 your service. Mr. Sheehan, you talked about which is worse. That's how you ended that

647
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:32,540
 dynamic presentation that you had. Which is worse? Do we try to put this together and

648
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:38,120
 save ourselves with the world, or do we continue to put our heads in the sand that it doesn't

649
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:43,680
 exist and you know that it does? I'm at a loss. You all are giving us good information,

650
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,840
 and I think those in the audience want us to come up with some kind of recommendation,

651
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,680
 and I can't have it both ways. You've got to be solid.

652
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:58,180
 It's a very difficult issue. Because of the job assignments, when a person is a congressional

653
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:03,280
 representative, for example, and has the duty of representing her or his congressional district

654
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,560
 in the interests that are there, it's a job. As you know, a significant number of the Congress

655
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,840
 people are lawyers. They view themselves as representing a certain client base. The problem

656
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:20,520
 is that if we represent a nation state, and we insist upon maintaining the special privilege

657
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,560
 of our citizens, the special access we have to resources in the world, etc., even to the

658
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:31,880
 detriment of other nation states, we're still at a level of consciousness that is very dangerous.

659
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,400
 Stop talking too much. Break it down for me. You've got to give me two, three points. We

660
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,040
 don't have a lot of time. I love everything you said, but don't give it to me back yet.

661
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:46,880
 You've got to have something to hold onto. We're going to have to yield some of our national

662
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,160
 sovereignty to a global body like the United Nations.

663
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:55,200
 Right there. We're not doing that. We've got leadership presidents now who don't even acknowledge

664
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,680
 that it exists, so we're not going to yield anything. It's got to be approached to that.

665
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,120
 Maybe we do it better because we're former elected officials, public policy makers. Can't

666
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,640
 say it like that because the wall goes up and you don't get past it. It's got to be

667
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:12,320
 a better way to say that and begin to do some of what you suggest.

668
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:17,560
 It'll come probably through religious communities, that the altering of consciousness with regard

669
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:23,960
 to an angelic realm, an other dimension of reality. That's where most people categorize

670
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,960
 these types of discussions.

671
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,920
 Okay, and that's where you worked with the Jesuit Coordination Coalition. I think that's

672
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,600
 a good start. I think you can't leave out private industry. I think you can't leave

673
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:39,760
 out the universities. I mean, it's got to be a major coalition of things and institutions

674
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,240
 in our country and around the world that would come together more than one time with experts

675
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,160
 like yourselves and laymen like us and others who have interest in the issue because it

676
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:53,520
 is a world phenomenon. If we keep acting like it doesn't exist, then we all lose. The world

677
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,520
 loses.

678
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,520
 That's right.

679
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,240
 I think time is urgent and I'm very new at the issue, so I'm just learning it even as

680
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,600
 a member of the Appropriations Armed Service Committee. We tacitly touched it, but then

681
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:09,160
 it goes away. Even at the academy where we have outstanding young men and women who dedicate

682
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,920
 their lives to this country. They have some things that they look at and then it's put

683
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,920
 away.

684
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,960
 It's in the Air Force Academy book.

685
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,280
 Exactly. Exactly right.

686
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,280
 Talking about how to address UFOs.

687
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,280
 Exactly.

688
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,280
 I was going to go to the Air Force Academy.

689
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,680
 Do you feel the urgency? Do you all feel the urgency? I'm going to say your name. Thank

690
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:34,800
 you very much. Is there urgency here or are we just here just talking?

691
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:42,960
 Normally, people have put it away. Officially, right? Governments, but I think in a way there

692
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:50,720
 is because the potential has a very good potential. Like I said in my statement, it could really

693
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:56,400
 do the trick that everything else has failed. What do we do in this earth? We have tremendous

694
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:07,400
 problems besides this issue. Environmental problems, hunger and so on. Somehow, we don't

695
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:15,040
 seem to be able to deal with them as a world society. There's just too much fighting and

696
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:20,320
 ideological differences and religious differences. The issue of religious is very important.

697
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:27,640
 Look at all the recent problems we've had internationally with certain factions of the

698
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:33,160
 Islamic religion and all that. In fact, I wrote an article in the magazine about UFOs

699
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:41,680
 in Islam, which was quite interesting for me to research that. Like all religions, again,

700
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:50,480
 you have many factions within a religion. I do agree with Daniel. Probably if the pope

701
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:56,920
 and other religious figures, they might be the way to do it. That may do the trick rather

702
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:02,620
 than the political will because you know how politics are. You know better than we do how

703
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,960
 things get very difficult. I see half a minute left. Thank you very much

704
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,880
 for that. Just in kind of summing, trying to understand it, as an appropriator, 12 years

705
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:15,040
 on the Federal Appropriations Committee with a budget of nearly $3 trillion. Biggest being

706
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:19,640
 the Armed Services of $700 billion. Now we're on our knees. We don't have the money for

707
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:25,020
 this or that. Could this possibly be something that can save our budget, get more resources,

708
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:29,800
 make it universal, offer some kind of -- I'm looking at it from an appropriations point.

709
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,880
 There's got to be some coming together. We spent a lot of money doing a lot of things

710
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,360
 and never happened. Quick answer, yes.

711
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:39,440
 I sit here as an appropriator looking for dollars to help save America first and incidentally

712
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,880
 help the rest of the world. Sorry to interrupt there.

713
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,160
 Anything that can allow an object to loiter indefinitely, instantly accelerate and do

714
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,440
 it all silently, is using something better than petroleum for moving around.

715
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:58,040
 So there must be -- whatever that answer is, there must be something implicit in the reality

716
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:03,680
 of this phenomenon that will actually be a game changer. And that's really the one hope.

717
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,640
 We've got everything so messed up and every other way looking at the world. We're not

718
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:13,160
 cooperating. We're fighting. But if this is real, if there is an energy paradigm solution

719
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,860
 here in UFO phenomenon, that by itself is worth every single effort that we can make

720
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:30,200
 to get that out in the open. Thank you. Thank you very much. Senator Gravel.

721
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:37,200
 Let me point out that it's not only the problem of the Congress. It's the problem of the

722
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:43,400
 American people, which has been propagandized by the Congress and its leadership, that we

723
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:49,200
 are superior as Americans to anybody else in the world. That's the problem. If we're

724
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:59,680
 going to have a global community, we must put our humanness first before our nationality.

725
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:07,480
 And what the testimony that I read is that you're talking about a paradigm change in

726
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:14,720
 global governance. Now, let me ask this as a favor to you, to us, for this immediate

727
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:23,520
 hearing. Would you, Antonio, get together with Daniel and the others and draft a resolution

728
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:29,920
 that we could decide upon at the end of the hearings on Friday to recommend the creation

729
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:39,040
 of a United Nations agency using the Granada precedent and already the numbers, the resolutions

730
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:44,840
 that have been... So you draft that. It doesn't have to be 20 pages. It can be one page, maybe

731
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:50,960
 two paragraphs. You draft this so that we can get our hands around something in this

732
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:57,200
 regard. And then we'll have to make a decision, are we prepared as former public officials,

733
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,680
 as private citizens, to put our money where our mouth is, and that is to be globalists

734
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:09,240
 before we become nationalists. And that's the answer. So if you could provide us with

735
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:14,280
 that document, do we be deeply in your debt on this side of the table?

736
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,880
 I could start that a little bit because there's a provision in the United Nations which is

737
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:24,600
 called Uniting for Peace Resolution. And Henry Kissinger told us about this in Gov 180 at

738
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,960
 Harvard College. And he said, "If the world population ever finds out about this, we're

739
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,680
 all in trouble," he said. I was kind of wondering who he meant by "we."

740
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,680
 And he's right.

741
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,680
 Yeah, that's right.

742
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,640
 The government, the leadership is going to be in trouble once the people wake up.

743
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,640
 That's right.

744
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,360
 But you need a device. And right now, the device is the knowledge that you're bringing

745
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:49,040
 forward, that we're trying to observe here. So first, would you bring that resolution

746
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,040
 as soon as you can?

747
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,040
 Sure.

748
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,480
 We'll circulate it among the members and the leadership of the paradigm research group

749
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,480
 --

750
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,480
 Yeah, we can do that.

751
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,480
 -- to seek their ecstatic.

752
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,480
 We'll be glad to.

753
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:06,040
 Now, the question I would ask, Mr. Dolan, you mentioned that the compendium of documents

754
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:12,760
 that you're aware of has come about through Freedom of Information Act, has come about

755
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:21,080
 by accident in many regards. Is there anything out there that document-wise backs up the

756
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:28,760
 Roswell incident, that is, the crash and the humanoids? Is there any document that we could

757
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,760
 put our hands on?

758
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:38,320
 Yes, sir. There are a few very interesting documents, even as early as July 1947, FBI,

759
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:46,320
 which was involved in investigating the so-called flying saucers very actively, had a memo indicating

760
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:53,980
 that the debris or whatever was recovered at Roswell was being transferred to Wright

761
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:59,680
 Field Dayton, Ohio, U.S. Air Force headquarters. I think that's rather interesting. Whatever

762
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:05,880
 this was, if it was some kind of balloon apparatus, I think we could ask why would that be transferred

763
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,360
 to Wright Field.

764
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:16,880
 So that's interesting. There are a number of other documents that talk about rumors

765
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,680
 within the military discussions of --

766
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,200
 Yeah, that's not good enough to --

767
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,200
 Right. No, no.

768
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,200
 -- because it's hearsay.

769
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:29,080
 But regarding Roswell, there was -- back in 1994, the General Accounting Office of Congress

770
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:34,560
 was tasked with looking into the Roswell incident. All right. And this was on the initiative

771
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,960
 of the late Representative Stephen Schiff of New Mexico, whose constituents asked him

772
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:46,200
 to do this, and he did. Schiff talked about this at length, about how the Air Force and

773
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:52,120
 the Pentagon just stonewalled him, gave him nothing, gave him a lot of expletives as well

774
01:09:52,120 --> 01:10:00,400
 in the process. But what the GAO's investigation was that the relevant records at Roswell from

775
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:06,440
 the end of 1946 into, I think, 1948, 49 were gone. All of the records that they were looking

776
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:14,120
 for, that they expected to find, were, surprise, not there. And there was no explanation given.

777
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,040
 These were records, according to the GAO, that should not have been ever removed. They

778
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,960
 were permanent, but they were gone. And the Air Force, by the way, was very, very deft

779
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,360
 in their handling of this, because while the GAO investigation was going on, the United

780
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:35,840
 States Air Force took the initiative and did their own study, quote-unquote "study," in

781
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,760
 which they beat the GAO to the punch in terms of publicity, got their own thing out there

782
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:46,280
 and said, oh, yeah, it was a classified balloon project known as Mogul, which was designed

783
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:52,000
 to test to see whether the Soviets were detonating their own atomic devices. It's a big, big

784
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,800
 fat report. It looks very impressive. When you actually read it, it's a load of fluff,

785
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,560
 in my opinion. But that was their explanation. They beat the GAO to the punch and so they

786
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,560
 won the PR war.

787
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:12,000
 Thank you. Mr. Sheehan, would you address, briefly, what is the theological implication?

788
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:23,840
 Yeah. Coming to grips with the full import of the theological reality is what undergirds

789
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:33,900
 all of this, is that for each of us to recognize that we are incarnated in a material form,

790
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:39,820
 but that there are other vibrational frequencies at which there are other dimensions of reality

791
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:46,360
 going on at the same time, our theology is the realm in which we deal with it. It's a

792
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:52,400
 category of knowledge in the human family in which we deal with other dimensions of

793
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:57,040
 reality. What happens after death? How did we get here? What are we doing here? What's

794
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,220
 our ultimate purpose? These are things that are raised by the UFO issue and that's why

795
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:06,440
 I reiterate that it's theology, it's in the realm of theology that we have to come to

796
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:13,340
 address this. When we do, what we're going to discover is that we're going to draw down

797
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:18,720
 into our culture a lot of those same realities that, for example, the Native American culture

798
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:24,960
 and some of the aboriginal cultures understand that they are in a dynamic relationship with

799
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:32,840
 other dimensions, other vibrational frequencies. Our culture has closed itself off from that

800
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:39,240
 from the time of the enlightenment in trying to define ourselves as separated, individuated

801
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:46,240
 intellectual beings and that we're not in a harmonious, imbalanced relationship with

802
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:51,040
 the rest of reality. The consequences, of course, are falling upon us now because of

803
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:56,880
 the global climate change that we're experiencing, the contamination of our environment by ourselves.

804
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,360
 This is the crisis. I think one of the crises that's going to confront us and that my sense

805
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,080
 is that we're going to become much more, if we probe into the theology of all of this,

806
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:11,260
 we're going to come to have a much more profound appreciation for the Native American culture

807
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:17,280
 and the theology of the Native American culture and the faculty of intuitional perception

808
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:23,800
 that our human family has, which is a faculty that's evolving teleologically in our culture.

809
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,680
 This is what Teilhard de Chardin has dealt with it within the Jesuits. It's the cutting

810
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,640
 edge of modern theology and the insights that we've gained now through quantum physics

811
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:41,000
 since 1923 to 1926. We have to integrate into our scientific worldview the insights of quantum

812
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,560
 physics and we have to begin to readjust our basic worldview, as I pointed out before,

813
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,080
 to evolve a new worldview that integrates these capabilities.

814
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:59,280
 Thank you very much. I yield back the balance of my time.

815
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,280
 Congressman Cook.

816
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:10,400
 I would like to start by asking Colonel French, you were involved in the initiations of the

817
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:18,320
 Blue Book processes. Could you elaborate a little more on what you found out from that

818
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:26,860
 and especially, so I have a better understanding of how that got stopped or discarded or what

819
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:32,120
 exactly happened on the Blue Book and how long did that go on? I just need a better

820
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,120
 understanding.

821
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:39,000
 I'd like to start with a curve if you don't mind too much, but they ask about what happened

822
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:48,680
 to the results of the accident at Alamogordo. All of that was taken to what is called the

823
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:54,560
 Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. What was shipped, there was

824
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:02,880
 physical debris, actually parts of some kind of airplane. Another unusual aspect of it

825
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:12,880
 was though the metal wasn't any thicker than cellophane, but you put it in your hand and

826
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:18,920
 you crush it together and it flops right back into shape. Had it analyzed, it didn't come

827
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:26,160
 from Earth. There's no known, we have no known source of whatever that metal was.

828
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,480
 You had that in your hands?

829
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,480
 Yes.

830
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,480
 You've actually held some of that?

831
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,880
 Yes.

832
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:39,560
 So has Marcel. Jesse Marcel did the same thing.

833
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:46,760
 I understand from the Roswell basically what's generally called the Roswell incident. I realize

834
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:54,360
 there were several different locations of materials gathered up. There were dozens

835
01:15:54,360 --> 01:16:02,040
 and dozens of witnesses on the materials and you're clearly one of them. At least in terms

836
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:09,880
 of the analysis of the materials, not necessarily gathering them up. Tell us about were there

837
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:19,280
 witnesses of any, has been referred to as humanoid, because you don't hear nearly as

838
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,280
 much about that.

839
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:26,960
 They also were taken to the foreign technology division. There were, if I remember, about

840
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,960
 eight or nine corpses.

841
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:36,520
 I'm more interested right now in the witnesses to that. I've read the accounts, but there

842
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,520
 were many witnesses of material.

843
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:47,360
 I can't point you to anyone that can add to that except Marcel, because he was the first

844
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:56,320
 one to pick it up. Went out to the crash, policed up the pieces of the airplane and

845
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,640
 there were specific markings on them, like they were identification numbers for parts

846
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,760
 or something of that nature. But it looked rather like Arabic writing. It didn't look

847
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,840
 like anything from our neck of the woods.

848
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:16,920
 Did Marcel indicate that he had actually witnessed the humanoid part? I know he witnessed the

849
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,120
 answer over here. Well, and please, if anybody can illuminate.

850
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:24,840
 First of all, there are quite many, many witnesses, of course, who've gone on the record about

851
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:29,880
 Roswell. Unfortunately, we'll have a Roswell panel here during the meeting, and there are

852
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,160
 a number of researchers who have specialized in that.

853
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,680
 My question started off as the blue book.

854
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:45,080
 Blue book was the US Air Force official public investigative body of UFOs from 1940. Actually,

855
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,160
 he was a successor of a couple of previous ones, started in 1952, went up to 1969 when

856
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,160
 it was closed down.

857
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:55,000
 Okay, but it did include some of the Roswell stuff. It included nothing in Roswell, the

858
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
 blue book.

859
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,360
 No, there's nothing on Roswell.

860
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:03,520
 Okay, so that was, okay, well, I just, I asked about the blue book, and what did you say

861
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,920
 it was closed down, and what was the reason for that?

862
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,760
 The end of 1969. Well, what happened in the 1960s is that the United States had a big,

863
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:16,320
 big wave of UFO sightings, 1965, '66, made the news. Gerald Ford, congressman in Michigan,

864
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:21,760
 talked about it on the floor of Congress. His constituents had seen UFOs, and he was

865
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:27,120
 not satisfied with the answers that were coming from the Air Force, and the pressure was really

866
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:32,680
 on the United States Air Force to do something about this. It's hard to remember because

867
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:36,200
 it's so far back in time, but the Air Force was losing a lot of credibility on this. A

868
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:41,320
 lot of people were not believing the Air Force explanations, and swamp gas became a big national

869
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:46,080
 joke at that time, and so really all the Air Force wanted to do was just get rid of UFOs,

870
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:51,600
 and so what they ended up doing was they contracted with the University of Colorado to conduct

871
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:58,680
 what was to be the first true public scientific investigation of UFOs, and the whole attitude

872
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:05,000
 was whatever Colorado comes up with, that's what we're going to conclude, and what that

873
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,240
 study did, that was a whole big mess, and half the scientists got fired midway through

874
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:15,480
 the project because they were believers. The man running it, Edward Condon, was absolutely

875
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:21,520
 dead set against any kind of pro-UFO, pro-ET. So based on that recommendation, the Air Force

876
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,600
 was able to wash their hands, say thank you very much, and they said we're out of the

877
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,000
 business, we're not doing this anymore.

878
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,680
 And there's no way to retrieve any of the, I just got to make sure I understand this,

879
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:36,180
 and I appreciate it, because you've illuminated this greatly for me, but is there any way

880
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:42,400
 to find out exactly what was in the Blue Book at this point then? I'm looking for--

881
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,400
 Yes, yes.

882
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,600
 Well, the Blue Book files are--

883
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,600
 They're still there.

884
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,720
 You're saying they're absolutely being covered up?

885
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,400
 No, no, the Blue Book files are--

886
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,560
 Oh, we can still read those. Okay, well I was confused on that issue.

887
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,560
 The problem is--

888
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,560
 Classified sections.

889
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,600
 Yeah, and the problem is the Roswell stuff is not in the Blue Book files.

890
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,640
 Okay, now I've got a better understanding of all that.

891
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:08,880
 And in the prior panel, Stanton Friedman referred to a memo by General Carole Ballander in which

892
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:16,280
 he stated, in closing Blue Book down in 1969, that UFO reports affecting national security

893
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,280
 were not part of the Blue Book system, so Blue Book--

894
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,480
 I do remember him saying that.

895
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:31,260
 If I could turn to Mr. Hunaus and to Mr. Sheehan, religion has been brought up and implied in

896
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:38,440
 terms of this whole thing several ways, and now you're not trying to say that just because

897
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:45,160
 Pat Robertson has a particular view or because popes in the past have said things that clearly

898
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:52,440
 don't agree with what you're saying as a Jesuit, that religion is somehow against the idea

899
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,760
 of extraterrestrial life?

900
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:00,800
 No, in fact, it's quite the contrary, that, remember, religion, religiro, the Latin derivative

901
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,440
 of religiro is to relink.

902
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:09,360
 The whole idea of relinking the intellect, intellectus, the root of intellect is intellectus,

903
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,040
 the ability to distinguish the difference between.

904
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,880
 The whole ability that we develop somewhere between osteopithecus and homo erectus, this

905
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:22,600
 intellectual capacity, we alienated ourselves in a separate entity here behind our eyeballs

906
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,000
 from all the rest of reality.

907
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
 Sure.

908
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
 That's the danger.

909
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
 OK.

910
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,400
 But I'm going to adjust this a little bit.

911
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:35,240
 Was there an implication that it's more of the-- well, let me just say this.

912
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:42,680
 Going to Christian religions in specific, you think there's some bias against the belief

913
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,680
 in extraterrestrial?

914
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:49,040
 Because you were talking about maybe we're going to have to accept this from a different

915
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,440
 religious perspective or something.

916
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:55,960
 I think that within one of the features, the unique features of Catholic Christiology,

917
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:02,000
 for example, is each of the world views that I'd pointed out that have political implications,

918
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,400
 there are subsets of Catholic and Christian theology in all of those.

919
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:10,920
 So there's a reactionary world view that is fundamentalist, that everything is divided

920
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:16,480
 into good guys and bad guys, and there's Satan in angelic realms, and they've projected

921
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:23,040
 this satanic reality that they have onto extraterrestrials, which is very, very dangerous.

922
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:30,760
 Well, I'm not in any way here to do missionary work for my particular religious faith or

923
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,440
 certainly to speak for my religious faith.

924
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:39,040
 I'm a Mormon, but on a fundamental level, many Mormons believe it's consistent with

925
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:44,600
 the doctors of the church that there is life outside the church.

926
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:49,040
 It's an official doctrine of the Church of the Latter-day Saints, the actual belief in

927
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,040
 extraterrestrial intelligence.

928
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,520
 Well, and I wanted to make that point clear.

929
01:22:51,520 --> 01:23:01,200
 Again, I'm not here for that to preach or anything like that, but I'm also ... I think,

930
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:08,520
 and I think most Mormons believe as I do on that, would still say that's still a leap

931
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:13,000
 to say that we've had the visitation, and there's nothing in the religious sense that

932
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:21,240
 would prohibit that, but we need as strong an evidence as we can to help this panel open

933
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:25,340
 up some congressional hearings, and by the way, I'm not giving up on the United States

934
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,340
 Congress yet.

935
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:28,240
 I don't think we have to go to the United Nations.

936
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:34,760
 Maybe that might be a way, but let's also try to open this up at the United States Congress

937
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,760
 level.

938
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,760
 I agree.

939
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:44,240
 The Catholic position on all this.

940
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,640
 My grandmother's a Catholic.

941
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,560
 That's all I have to do with the Catholic Church.

942
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:54,440
 However, it's very important, one thing that the Catholic Church has done, and believe

943
01:23:54,440 --> 01:24:01,080
 it or not, they commissioned the building of a wide-angle lens to search the skies for

944
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:04,720
 inbound UFOs.

945
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,080
 It's in Tucson, Arizona, believe it or not.

946
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,080
 Okay.

947
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:14,520
 Well, thank you.

948
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,640
 Thank you very much, Congresswoman Hooley.

949
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:26,320
 What kind of, I mean, the reaction over the last 30, 40 years in the United States, what's

950
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:31,440
 the reaction, and what has happened in the rest of the world?

951
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,880
 What's going on?

952
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,760
 Have there been sightings?

953
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:41,600
 Do they feel differently about it than we, you know, a lot of people feel about it here?

954
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,600
 What's happening elsewhere?

955
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:49,120
 Well, as I said in my statement, the one thing that I think even skeptics would have to agree

956
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,520
 is that the UFO phenomenon is worldwide.

957
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,520
 It doesn't matter.

958
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,200
 I mean, it doesn't matter the religion.

959
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:58,860
 It doesn't matter the ethnic origin, the language, the culture.

960
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,920
 It has been reported all over the world.

961
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:07,040
 Now, there are some sociological differences, as you would expect, from different cultures.

962
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:15,400
 But we see there's quite a rich history of UFO, even UFO investigations, official investigations,

963
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:22,560
 and we will be discussing this in a few more sessions during this week about investigations.

964
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:30,000
 And we have, in fact, with us some members from some of the South American agencies.

965
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:38,080
 So we've seen an opening in recent years, particularly in some European countries and

966
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,080
 particularly in South America.

967
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:46,880
 Now, odd as it may seem, it almost seems to be good politics now in South America to have

968
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,200
 a UFO investigation.

969
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:55,380
 I know it sounds awkward, but the Latin culture is obviously more open.

970
01:25:55,380 --> 01:26:00,920
 It's much less ridicule in the media and all that about this phenomenon.

971
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,580
 And so we've seen a trend.

972
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:07,440
 It started with Uruguay back in the late '70s, and we have a representative that will be

973
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,880
 speaking later this week.

974
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:19,240
 And then Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina recently announced the creation of a UFO agency

975
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,080
 within the Air Force.

976
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:25,440
 What is interesting about the South American approach to this phenomenon from an official

977
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:31,600
 point of view is that there is not an adversarial relationship between the official military

978
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,440
 agencies and the civilian UFO committees or UFO groups.

979
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,760
 Totally different from the United States, where even in the days of Blue Book, there

980
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:46,880
 was always a big fight between ufologists, civilian ufologists, and the Air Force.

981
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,200
 That was classic, if you read the history of UFOs in the United States.

982
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:56,600
 And it used to be a little bit like that, too, in South America, not as bad as here.

983
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:04,320
 But now you see that they cooperate, and usually what happens is because a lot of these agencies,

984
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,360
 they have a limited budget, a small budget.

985
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:13,480
 So they call for volunteers from the civilian community, and that shows us a model.

986
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,140
 We don't have to have an adversarial.

987
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:16,800
 We don't have to fight the government.

988
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:17,800
 This is a mystery.

989
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,960
 We should all work together in order to solve this mystery.

990
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:25,920
 So that's at least some of what is going on.

991
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,680
 But even Russia has had a lot of official investigations.

992
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:35,200
 Even under the Soviet Union, there were committees from the -- there were actually two committees

993
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:39,260
 that were going on in the late '70s and '80s.

994
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:45,400
 One was a public one through the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the other one was a secret

995
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:51,140
 one by the KGB and the Ministry of Defense, the Soviet military.

996
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:56,720
 Nobody knew about that one publicly, but the scientific one was even officially revealed

997
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,760
 even in the controlled Soviet media.

998
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:06,040
 And then, of course, under Gorbachev in the 1980s, Glasnost, it opened up, and the UFO

999
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:13,560
 phenomenon became very, very popular in the late Soviet society and into modern Russia.

1000
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:21,760
 So China has had kind of a semi-official organization called the China UFO Research Organization.

1001
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,540
 We have one of its founding members here also attending this hearing.

1002
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:32,280
 So yes, you see it all over the world, and other countries actually have a more open

1003
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,780
 attitude, I mean, officially.

1004
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:39,840
 So it provides a model also for the U.S., in my opinion.

1005
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:44,120
 For any of the panelists, the other question I have, one of the other questions I have

1006
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:52,840
 is a lot of people, when they talk about this, at least in this country, are ridiculed when

1007
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,000
 they talk about it.

1008
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:03,000
 This is, you know, pooha, you know, you're somewhere in outer space.

1009
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,480
 What -- why, I guess?

1010
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:13,920
 Has there been some organization or is it just our attitudes in the United States tell

1011
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,720
 me why there's so much skepticism in this country?

1012
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:22,400
 >> I'll try to feel that.

1013
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,960
 I do find privately people are much more open about this than they are when they're in a

1014
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:26,960
 public situation.

1015
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,960
 That's one thing.

1016
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:28,960
 >> Right.

1017
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,120
 >> People discover that -- probably any of these researchers, and they discover, oh,

1018
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:38,280
 you research UFOs, inevitably they will say, oh, let me tell you about what I saw last

1019
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,120
 year, five years, 20 years ago.

1020
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:43,840
 So those stories are out there, and people -- I firmly believe there is a true hunger

1021
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,720
 for knowledge on this once people realize that there's something to it.

1022
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:54,520
 But I agree with you, in our public discourse, this is a third rail, whether you are in major

1023
01:29:54,520 --> 01:30:00,120
 media or politics or academia, they're all really the same in this regard.

1024
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:04,560
 I had a professor at UCLA call me a number of years ago, a department chair said, well,

1025
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,320
 I really just want to let you know I enjoy your books.

1026
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,320
 I said, thank you.

1027
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,320
 Why are you whispering in the phone?

1028
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,960
 Which literally he was whispering, and he said the typical thing that every professor

1029
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:19,400
 would say, well, my department is kind of political and not go -- right.

1030
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:23,400
 So it's always the retired ones who look for me.

1031
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:29,280
 But personally, I believe, you know, the tone was set back in the '50s.

1032
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:35,680
 And in fact, the top skeptic debunker in the U.S. at that time was a Harvard astronomer

1033
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,720
 by the name of Donald Menzel.

1034
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,840
 Menzel wrote a number of books.

1035
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:46,680
 He was like the pit bull guard dog maintaining orthodoxy.

1036
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:50,500
 You know, if some little community college professor was going to get out of line and

1037
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:54,360
 talk about UFOs, here's Menzel, Harvard astronomer, who's going to argue with Menzel?

1038
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,360
 And he'd slap them down.

1039
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,560
 Menzel, we learned years later, had a very, very close relationship with the National

1040
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:03,360
 Security Agency, very close.

1041
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,120
 Does this prove that the NSA used him in this capacity?

1042
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,120
 Who knows?

1043
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,640
 But these things -- this is how it looks.

1044
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:16,560
 Back in the late 1970s, journalist Carl Bernstein had the famous Rolling Stone article in which

1045
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,680
 he said there are over 400 U.S. journalists that I have identified who had a covert relationship

1046
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,920
 with the Central Intelligence Agency.

1047
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:28,760
 CIA promptly said, "Well, we don't do that anymore."

1048
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,200
 And if you read the language carefully in their statements, especially in the 1990s,

1049
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:37,120
 they're very lawyerly in their denials, it's very clear that there are relationships.

1050
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:42,720
 So what I am suggesting, and I guess this is the conspiracy angle here, but I would

1051
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:48,800
 suggest that there are proxies that work with national security elements.

1052
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:55,040
 Look, it's an open revolving door in much of our society anyway.

1053
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:59,960
 Most of this is out in the open, but I think that there are relationships, friendly relationships

1054
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:10,740
 with academic and with media and political as well, where you have the herders who basically

1055
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:12,320
 keep the underlings in line.

1056
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:15,800
 And every now and then someone gets out of line and they have to be dealt with.

1057
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:20,160
 So I think that that's where the culture is created and it has a top-down effect.

1058
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,120
 And most people, they don't want to be Superman.

1059
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,880
 They have their jobs, they have got their family, they got their things, they can't

1060
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,240
 fight the machine.

1061
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:30,400
 So they just, they live their lives and hope that someone else takes it on.

1062
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:36,040
 And there are documents that Mr. Dolan can tell you about, the internal documents in

1063
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:43,240
 the Air Force and others where they consciously instruct their officers to ridicule and debunk

1064
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:47,920
 people, is a specific official policy inside the Air Force.

1065
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:52,240
 People they know positively have seen one of these things to try to destroy their credibility.

1066
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,240
 Yeah.

1067
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:59,720
 In the Robertson panel, which is a famous CIA symposium that took place in January of

1068
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:04,800
 1953, in fact, they used the word "debunk."

1069
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,800
 It's in the document itself.

1070
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,840
 As the Colonel says, you know, specifically assigned to go out and ridicule them and tell

1071
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,440
 them they're ridiculous.

1072
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:18,360
 And most people can't stand up against that kind of thing coming from authority figures.

1073
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,360
 Right.

1074
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:23,840
 The Robertson panel was the last act of the Truman administration, it was the last weekend

1075
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,920
 of Harry Truman's presidency that this classified panel took place, and it was specifically

1076
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,660
 related to UFOs.

1077
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:32,400
 Very interesting little historical factoid there.

1078
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:37,560
 And as Daniel just pointed out, its conclusion was, this is a necessary topic and we must

1079
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,280
 debunk it to the American people.

1080
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:44,960
 This is not a good thing for them to be thinking about, and they were working with the media

1081
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,960
 to do that.

1082
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:46,960
 Thank you.

1083
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:47,960
 Thank you.

1084
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,240
 Thank you very much.

1085
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:54,360
 Where was the balloon, the Mogul balloon that was supposed to have been the Roswell incident,

1086
01:33:54,360 --> 01:34:00,120
 from where was it supposedly launched?

1087
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:06,840
 The Mogul, I thought they were at White Sands, Alamogordo, that area.

1088
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:10,640
 We have the record, I'm so sorry.

1089
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:11,640
 From where?

1090
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:18,000
 You know what a pie ball is, it's a high-altitude balloon that they track, they launch them

1091
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,080
 and then track them so they can keep track of upper air currents.

1092
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:29,960
 But when it was launched, when Marcel launched the thing, he would have been probably standing

1093
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:33,980
 right in front of base ops because that's where they send them up from.

1094
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:35,120
 From where?

1095
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,760
 Base operations.

1096
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,000
 You see the fighter squadrons or bomber squadrons or whatever they have, their own particular

1097
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,840
 area, but transient airplanes always launch from base operations.

1098
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:51,120
 How close is one of those to Roswell?

1099
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,840
 It's on Roswell base.

1100
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:57,800
 So what they're saying is that the balloon was launched there and crashed there.

1101
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,800
 Yes.

1102
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,280
 I don't know where exactly that it crashed.

1103
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:11,120
 See, these balloons were supposed to be determining possible Soviet nuclear detonations.

1104
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:17,520
 I'm just curious where they, because if it was launched somewhere else, the probability

1105
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,020
 that landing at Roswell was vanishingly small.

1106
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:27,400
 I had a course in advanced statistics and it's vanishingly small probability.

1107
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,960
 The United States Air Force in their 1994 reports said these were launched out of White

1108
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:41,040
 Sands and actually they had a schedule of a number of these balloon launches that went

1109
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,840
 down and were recovered.

1110
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:51,080
 So there were several that were from the spring of 1947 and in fact they speculated, this

1111
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:57,120
 wasn't really a slam dunk, but they indicated that they thought that they'd identified the

1112
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:02,040
 one launch that was in fact supposedly the Roswell crash and I'm trying to remember the

1113
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,040
 date on that.

1114
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:07,720
 As has been mentioned, the curious thing about all of this is in the GAO report, there was

1115
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:12,620
 nothing for them to look at because all of the relevant information had been destroyed.

1116
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:18,280
 They had no idea at whose command had been destroyed and this is very unorthodox.

1117
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,560
 It should have been there.

1118
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,880
 Kind of interesting, isn't it?

1119
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:27,200
 I was a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I think it was simply called the

1120
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,020
 Science Committee then.

1121
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:33,960
 When Schiff held this, I thought it was a hearing apparently, it was a briefing and

1122
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:39,840
 it was what, about '94 or '05, I came to the Congress in '93 and I remember his interest

1123
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,840
 in that.

1124
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:45,200
 When I was first approached about this week's activities, I was cautioned that if you do

1125
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:53,200
 this you could possibly be relegated to the lunatic fringe and this may not be good for

1126
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:59,440
 your potential activities for the rest of your political productive life.

1127
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:04,720
 I'm 87 in five weeks, so I don't know how much remains anyhow, but I said, "I'm going

1128
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:11,560
 to do this because I think there's a very serious constitutional issue involved here."

1129
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:21,120
 Whether there are UFOs or not, whether they are extraterrestrial or not is really quite

1130
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:26,040
 irrelevant to whether or not there ought to be hearings on this because the First Amendment

1131
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:32,960
 to the Constitution says, "The right of the people to petition the government for a redress

1132
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,240
 of grievances."

1133
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,680
 Mr. Sheehan, doesn't this fall within that?

1134
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:46,040
 Oh yes, there's no doubt about this, but the fact of the matter is in a national security

1135
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:52,320
 state, from the passage of the National Security Act of 1947, there has been an entire caveat

1136
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:57,240
 on the Constitution that things that fall under national security, when Oliver North

1137
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:00,680
 can sit right in front of you and say, "Sure, I lied to you, the Congress, because this

1138
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:05,920
 was a covert operation, that we're in charge, you're not in charge."

1139
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:10,880
 There's an entire national security state kind of subculture that believes that they

1140
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:16,760
 have the right, not only to hold information back from Congress, but to openly defy Congress.

1141
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:20,520
 When you pass the Boland Amendment, prohibiting them from engaging in the covert operations

1142
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,640
 against Nicaragua, they go ahead and do it anyhow.

1143
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:27,680
 The danger as a national security state, and if it arose in the context of the Cold War

1144
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:31,980
 with the Soviet Union, we should move very aggressively at the end of the Cold War to

1145
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:36,840
 try to disassemble some of those structures of the national security state, not try to

1146
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,720
 create a new one, so that they went searching very quickly for some ultimate other that

1147
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:48,480
 they had to find, and they ended up having Afghanistan, or Iran, or Iraq.

1148
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:54,280
 It's a mindset, and it's that whole kind of retrenchment into a defensive position in

1149
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,360
 the face of the ultimate other.

1150
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:01,640
 It's an ultimate mindset that we have to try to overcome, and as I point out, it's a theological

1151
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:08,560
 issue because that is a malfunction of our intellect, and it cuts us off from our harmonious

1152
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,400
 relationship not only with the rest of the universe, but all other intelligent species

1153
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:16,160
 in the universe, and that's what we have to address, I think.

1154
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:18,880
 It's a worldview issue.

1155
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,220
 Thank you.

1156
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:26,040
 For 20 years in the Congress, I served on the Armed Services Committee, and I remembered

1157
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:32,040
 Eisenhower's caution as he left office, that we should be concerned about the military-industrial

1158
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,040
 complex.

1159
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:39,480
 I understand that in the original draft, it was military-industrial-congressional complex,

1160
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:43,200
 and he didn't want to be too political, so he took out the congressional.

1161
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:49,500
 It's too bad he did that, because this really is a military-industrial-congressional complex.

1162
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:53,840
 The F-35 is built in 48 states.

1163
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,160
 There are 96 senators, and I don't know how many hundred representatives support the F-35,

1164
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:04,160
 not because we may need it, but because it creates jobs.

1165
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:11,600
 Too many of us cannot differentiate between jobs that consume wealth and jobs that create

1166
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,120
 wealth.

1167
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,720
 It's on the front page of the Washington Post today.

1168
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:21,460
 You look at the headlines of the Washington Post, and it says that the sequester of trying

1169
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:25,440
 to cut back on the military budget, all the arguments are coming out now.

1170
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:29,840
 We can't do that because of all the jobs and the employment.

1171
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,840
 It's an old saw.

1172
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:37,620
 We've developed an economy that is so reliant upon military spending that, in fact, it drives

1173
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:41,040
 the policies to go looking for adversaries.

1174
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:46,640
 If we lose the adversary of the Soviet Union on December 31st of 1991 with the dissolving

1175
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:51,040
 of the Soviet Union, it takes them less than a few years to find another one.

1176
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:56,280
 If you have to go so desperately that you're looking to Afghanistan and Iran as being your

1177
01:40:56,280 --> 01:41:00,960
 ultimate threat to the most powerful nation in the history of the human civilization,

1178
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,840
 there's a motive for that, and it's not because they're threatening you.

1179
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:09,800
 We had a hearing on this in the Congress about the economic effects ... If I was chairman,

1180
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:14,560
 I wouldn't have held a hearing ... economic effects of sequestration.

1181
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,920
 When it came time for my question, my five minutes, I said, "Suppose when we left here

1182
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:25,200
 tonight we broke all the windows out of this building, and we did that all over Washington,

1183
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:29,600
 and overnight a crew came in and replaced all of those broken windows, and we did this

1184
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:30,680
 every day.

1185
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:33,680
 We broke out all the windows and the crew would replace them all.

1186
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,760
 Wouldn't that create a lot of jobs?

1187
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,040
 Just think of the jobs that that would create."

1188
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:44,880
 My question was, do you think that would have a long-term beneficial effect on the economy?

1189
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:49,120
 I wanted them to understand the difference between jobs that create wealth and jobs that

1190
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,120
 consume wealth.

1191
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,920
 Well, we've been talking about the Constitution and why I'm here.

1192
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,920
 I'm here because I think that the Congress owes the American people a hearing on this

1193
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:05,200
 subject.

1194
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,200
 You may be dead wrong.

1195
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,100
 There may be nothing to UFOs.

1196
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:09,520
 That is irrelevant.

1197
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,640
 You have a right to petition the government for redress or grievances.

1198
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:15,720
 All of my questions have been anticipated by my colleagues.

1199
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:21,040
 Thank you all very much for a very good panel, and we'll now stand in recess for lunch.

1200
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,040
 Thank you.

1201
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:22,040
 Thank you.
