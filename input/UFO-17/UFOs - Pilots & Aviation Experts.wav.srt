1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,960
 Thank you very much.

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:20,840
 I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth to this committee

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,200
 today.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,280
 Thank you very much.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:38,120
 I'm delighted that this first panel includes people that have been in airplanes as pilots,

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
 flying those.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,960
 They've also been involved as controllers and I understand FAA administration is represented

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
 here as someone from that.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:01:00,120
 I'd also like to just acknowledge a gentleman on this panel that's flown more combat missions

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,780
 for the United States Air Force than any other person in the history of the United States

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,800
 and his record is double the man that's in second place and that's Lieutenant Colonel

12
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,120
 Richard French.

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,520
 So you've been sworn in, we'll start with a testimony of John Callahan, if I could just

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,240
 quickly ask Mr. Bookman time limits that have been determined for this panel?

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,400
 Ten minutes for opening statements and then we'll divide the remaining time among them.

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,280
 How much time for questions?

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,960
 Depends on if they keep to their ten minutes.

18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,280
 Well hey, I've got the gavel, I'll keep to it.

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,400
 Then it will be roughly a ten minute Q&A session for each member of Congress.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,960
 Then they're definitely going to keep to it.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
 John Callahan, if you could begin.

22
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
 All right.

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,960
 I don't know what I can do in ten minutes but I'll do the best I can.

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,720
 Apparently you guys already have a copy of what I'm going to say.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,360
 I'll just hit the highlights.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,560
 I was the Division Chief of the Accidents Evaluations and Investigation Division of

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,600
 the FAA in Washington D.C. from 1981 to 1988.

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,320
 I was the first man selected for that position and we created that position.

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,280
 It came about after the air traffic control strike.

30
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,520
 FAA had no quality control in the system until the strike and then I was selected for that

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,080
 position and it turned out to be a division with five branches.

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,900
 During this time I was involved in the investigation of an extraordinary event and was asked not

33
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,240
 to talk about it.

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
 That's retiring.

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,720
 I decided that the public had a right for this information and that they could handle

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
 it.

37
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,840
 Nothing's happened to me as a result of discussing this out in public.

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:55,040
 In early January of 1987 I received a call from the air traffic control facility out

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,200
 in Alaska.

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,080
 It was the region and they wanted to know what to tell the media.

41
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,200
 Initially the office was full of media, they had them in the hall and every time they went

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,400
 out to do anything the media was sticking the microphone under their face and they wanted

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,160
 to know what to tell them.

44
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,080
 So I said, "Tell them about what?"

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,780
 He said, "About the UFO," and the next one was, "What UFO?"

46
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,040
 We had established a procedure that if anything newsworthy happened in the FAA, we and our

47
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,520
 division would know right away so we could defend the United States government.

48
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,200
 Anyway I said, "What UFO?"

49
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,880
 He said, "A couple of weeks ago," is what he told me, it was really a couple of months

50
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,880
 ago, they had a UFO chase at 747 across the Alaskan skies for some 31 minutes.

51
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,760
 But like who believes in UFOs?

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,160
 Somehow the media heard that this was going on and now they're out there in the halls

53
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,600
 and he didn't know what to do.

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,040
 They couldn't do their job and he was kind of panicking.

55
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,160
 So I gave him our official answer, "Tell them it's under investigation."

56
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,560
 And once you tell them that they kind of drift away and they're all gone.

57
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,720
 Then I said, "I want you to pack up all that data we have, all the computer data."

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,840
 And in those days when we talk about computer data and disk, we're talking about those disks

59
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,200
 that were like a 78 record player and it looked like a Pi case that they have in the delis.

60
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,800
 There'd be 10 or 12 of these things inside.

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,760
 That was the disk that we're talking about, not these little things you carry around with

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,240
 you today.

63
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
 So I said, "I want all that stuff.

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
 I want the voice tapes.

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,680
 I want everything sent to the FAA tech center by tomorrow morning.

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,640
 You put them on the red eye flight and we're going to go down to the tech center and look

67
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,040
 at what you have."

68
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:55,280
 And the tech center is where they create the software programs for the FAA, 548 facilities

69
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
 there were at the time.

70
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,420
 I used to run that automation department, had 176 people working for me.

71
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:09,400
 They also had a program called Playback or they had another name too, I forget it right

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
 now.

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,320
 Anyway, you could go into the facility at the tech center and you could walk into one

74
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,720
 of the control rooms and you could say, "I want this position to be set up exactly like

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,440
 the position in Alaska.

76
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,760
 I want to stand over here and look at the radar and see what the controller's seeing.

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,980
 I want the voice tapes to come out of the speaker above and I want them synchronized

78
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,400
 with what we're looking at.

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,720
 So when the man says he's over Alaska, I want the radar to say he's over Alaska.

80
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,960
 And I want to see what was going on.

81
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,120
 I want to hear what was going on."

82
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,560
 So they played it for me and toward the end, while we're looking at it, they would shut

83
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,720
 the program off.

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,360
 So I said, "I want you to play it again, but don't shut the program off until I tell you

85
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
 to shut it off."

86
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:06,500
 And I had bought a camera with me, what do they call these cameras here, ones that play

87
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,760
 these things here.

88
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,560
 Anyway, I took a video of it the second time they played it and it was the first time I

89
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,880
 really used the camera and it was a little shaky if you ever get to look at it, but it

90
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,180
 shows you everything that was on the screen.

91
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,680
 And as they're playing the second one, they shut it off again toward the end.

92
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,560
 And I finally said, "There must be something wrong with our communications because I didn't

93
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,960
 come from the South."

94
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,400
 I said, "I want you to leave it on until I say shut it off."

95
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
 And they were a little hesitant.

96
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
 They didn't want to do that.

97
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,560
 And I finally told the engineer there, I said, "You either do it, I tell you, or tomorrow

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,480
 you're going to have to find another job."

99
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
 So they let it play.

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,040
 Well, toward the end, the controllers had taken a United and they asked them if they

101
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:59,420
 could delay his arrival time and have him check this 747 that was coming southbound.

102
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,480
 So they vectored him over to the 747, he's about 2,000 feet beneath him.

103
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,160
 And the United says, "It's a beautiful airplane, the moon behind him, it looks good."

104
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,720
 He says, "It's so clear up here, you can see it the next Tuesday."

105
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
 And then he passed by.

106
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,580
 Well, after he passed by, that target that had been chasing the 747 turned around and

107
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,840
 started following the United as he went down into Alaska.

108
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,440
 Now, when the Japanese pilot first come on the frequency, for you guys that are familiar

109
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,580
 with radar or how the military or the controllers work, when he first come on the frequency

110
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,680
 for the controller, the first words out of his mouth was, "Do you have traffic for me?"

111
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,880
 And when a controller hears these words, it means doom because right away he forgot something.

112
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,600
 He's got somebody else up there that shouldn't and why would a pilot ask if we had traffic?

113
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,560
 And he looked at a scope and he says, "Negative, there's no traffic in your area."

114
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,760
 And the Japanese pilot says, "Oh yeah, there's traffic out here and it's at 12 o'clock and

115
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
 about eight miles."

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
 He's telling him.

117
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,920
 Well, and the next thing the controller says is, "Can you tell me what type is?

118
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,440
 Can you make out the type of aircraft, any markings on the plane that we can find out

119
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
 who it is?"

120
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,800
 He's thinking it's a military aircraft.

121
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,640
 And the Japanese pilot says, "There's no markings.

122
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,400
 It's as big as four aircraft carriers.

123
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,680
 It has yellow and white lights around the center and it's big."

124
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,200
 And he was a little bit worried.

125
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,200
 Well, this machine followed him down for 31 minutes halfway through his flight.

126
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,480
 He makes a 360 degree turn.

127
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,920
 Now, when I say he makes it, he doesn't do anything unless the FAA says you can do this.

128
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,200
 So they told him if you want to deviate, you want to change your altitude, let us know.

129
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,920
 When he changed his altitude a couple of times, he makes a 360 and this UFO stayed with him

130
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,840
 all the way, scared the pants off him.

131
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,360
 I don't know how much more time I got.

132
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
 Anyway, when I got done-

133
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,240
 You've got about a minute and a half to two minutes.

134
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
 Okay.

135
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,120
 So I shoot back to the FAA center and the administrator at the time was Admiral Ingen.

136
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,520
 I don't know if you guys knew Admiral Ingen.

137
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,160
 I got there about quarter to five because I wanted to go home with my wife and he heard

138
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,120
 I was in the building so he calls me up and he says, "Give me a five minute briefing on

139
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,860
 what you've seen."

140
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,720
 So I gave him what I'm telling you guys here and he wanted to know if that video I took

141
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,960
 would play on his TV and I said, "I guess so.

142
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,520
 The book says it can."

143
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,760
 So I plugged it in there and after a few minutes of watching the video, he calls his aide over

144
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,000
 and he says, "Go tell Kennedy I'm going to be a few minutes late."

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,440
 So he's watching it a little bit more and then he finally calls the aide over and says,

146
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,920
 "Go cancel the rest of my appointments tonight.

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,400
 We'll reschedule for some time next week."

148
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,660
 He says, "I have to go see the president and we're talking about Reagan."

149
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,720
 So when he got all done, he says, "Don't talk to anybody.

150
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,840
 I'll get back with you and I'll tell you what to do.

151
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,920
 I'm on my way to see Reagan."

152
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,200
 Next morning I came to work and I got a call from some guy who said he was at the CIA.

153
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,480
 He wanted to talk about a UFO.

154
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,760
 I said, "Are you talking to the wrong guy?

155
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
 I don't know anything about UFOs."

156
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,520
 He says, "Well, the one that happened over Alaska," I said, "You probably want to talk

157
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
 to the Admiral.

158
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,680
 I don't know what you're talking about."

159
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,680
 A few minutes later, the Admiral calls down and says, "I've stopped a briefing for you

160
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,320
 tomorrow at 10 o'clock or 9 o'clock," whatever it was, "in the round room."

161
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,260
 He says, "The president's scientific staff is coming over.

162
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,760
 Some CIA guys will be there."

163
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,760
 I think he said three, matter of fact, and some grunts will be coming along with them.

164
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,640
 He says, "Your task is to hand this stuff off to them.

165
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,280
 When they leave here, they have to take this with them because the FAA does not control

166
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
 UFOs."

167
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,240
 Now, I showed him all this stuff.

168
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
 When they got all-

169
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
 They had about 45 seconds.

170
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
 Okay.

171
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,840
 Well done, one of the scientists come out and said they had three or four questions

172
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,160
 they wanted to know the speed of the antenna, the frequency of the antenna, the logarithm

173
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,200
 for the height-finding equipment, and the people I brought with me just happened to

174
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,120
 be experts, and they answered all the questions.

175
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,120
 When they get done, the CIA guy standing next to me says to the people, "This event," pointing

176
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,720
 to the big screen they have in the room, "This event never happened.

177
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,800
 We were never here.

178
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,400
 You're confiscating all this data, and you're all sworn to secrecy."

179
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,920
 Scared the pants off of them.

180
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,920
 I had 22 people in the air, and they were leaving the room right away, don't know what's

181
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
 going to happen.

182
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,020
 So I said to this guy, "Well, what do you think it was?"

183
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,000
 I'm thinking at the time it's the South Bomber.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,120
 He says, "Oh," he says, "It's a UFO.

185
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
 Look at these guys.

186
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
 They're drooling.

187
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
 They can't wait to get their hands on all this data.

188
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,320
 We had boxes and boxes in those days of printouts.

189
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,360
 Can't wait to get their hands on that stuff."

190
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,880
 I says, "Is that right?"

191
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,840
 He says, "Yeah, this is the first time they ever had more than a moment of radar data

192
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
 to look at."

193
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,920
 Now, the big key was the word he had said, "This is the first time they ever had more

194
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,140
 than a minute or so of radar data, and now we've got 31 minutes."

195
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,140
 Thank you.

196
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
 Okay.

197
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:17,880
 We've got a major filer who could ... Go ahead.

198
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,120
 I'm a retired Air Force major with the 5,000 flying hours, and I'm currently the Eastern

199
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,880
 Regional Director of the Mutual UFO Network, which is studying this phenomenon, and editor

200
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,640
 of the Filers Files.

201
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,400
 When I was flying for the Air Force 420th Air Refueling Squadron stationed at RAF Scalthorpe

202
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:50,560
 in England in January of '62, we were in orbit for refueling fighter aircraft over the North

203
00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:00,640
 Sea at about 30,000 feet in our KB-50J tanker just after sunset on a clear night.

204
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:10,440
 London Control excitedly called us and notified us that they had an unidentified object hovering

205
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,660
 on their radar near Stonehenge.

206
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,640
 We were asked if we were willing to intercept the unidentified craft, and our refueling

207
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,480
 mission had just finished, so we quickly agreed to chase their UFO.

208
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,880
 We were given an intercept heading and started to dive toward the UFO.

209
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,920
 It was really an exciting situation.

210
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:46,400
 We were to go towards Stonehenge, which is over the center of England.

211
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,320
 London Control was diverting all aircraft out of our way so that we could have a clear

212
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,600
 path for the intercept.

213
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,740
 Then we realized we were above our red line speed on the aircraft and had to pull back

214
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:07,640
 on the power, and London Control started giving us distances to the hovering UFO next.

215
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:20,320
 It was some 60 miles ahead and then 40 and so on, and as we got closer, we got the radar

216
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:28,640
 going on our aircraft and picked up the hovering UFO in the distance, about 30 miles.

217
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:36,520
 It was an exceptionally large radar return.

218
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,140
 Just judging on the size of the radar return, it was about equal to the Brooklyn Bridge

219
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,640
 or the Firth or Fourth Bridge in Scotland, which is a huge bridge about a mile long.

220
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,440
 It was the biggest radar return that I'd ever seen on the aircraft radar.

221
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,600
 It was sharp and solid as compared to the fuzziness of a rain cloud.

222
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,000
 I felt the craft must be made of steel or some kind of strong metal.

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,040
 We were doing about 425 miles per hour as we approached about 10 miles.

224
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,680
 This gives you an example of how large a radar return it was.

225
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:23,520
 It was a dark night, and we could only see a series of dim lights directly ahead.

226
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,840
 This is something it ought to look like in the distance.

227
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,000
 Suddenly, the UFO seemed to come alive and the lights brightened immensely, and the UFO

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,320
 accelerated in a launch similar to a space shuttle taking off.

229
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,000
 It lit up the sky and disappeared, frankly.

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,760
 We saw much brighter lights and a fantastic acceleration.

231
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:53,440
 It seemed to go straight up, just estimating speed like 50,000 miles an hour, 100 times

232
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,320
 faster than we were moving.

233
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,800
 We asked London Control if they had any rocket launches in the area.

234
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,360
 London Control seemed as disappointed as we were, and the controller said, "There are

235
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,920
 no rocket launches in the area.

236
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,400
 Thank you for your intercept, you are now cleared to return to your mission."

237
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:21,080
 The incident was recorded in my navigator's log and was mentioned the next day in operations.

238
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,640
 Interestingly, the Air Force did not seem particularly interested.

239
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:32,120
 A few weeks later, we were invited to a dining in with Prince Philip as a speaker, and he

240
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,640
 asked to speak with the air crews that had chased the UFO, so apparently London Control

241
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,600
 had told him that we had to chase this UFO, and we sat down at the table with him, and

242
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:52,240
 he was very friendly, and I essentially told him what I just told you, and he indicated

243
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,840
 that he regularly interviewed the air crews that were chasing UFOs.

244
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,800
 Either he or his aide would interview them.

245
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:16,480
 I asked why he, Prince Philip, was personally interested in UFOs, and he said that his uncle,

246
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:24,640
 the Earl Monboton, had seen the UFOs close up in the Navy, and that obviously he believed

247
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,120
 his uncle.

248
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:35,080
 This gives you some indications of the ships that this one was taking over Japan, and if

249
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:42,600
 you notice, there's a large cylinder, but outside the cylinder, there's 12 disc craft,

250
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,240
 and this is typically what they do.

251
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,440
 They're often called mother ships because they launch the smaller disc-shaped craft

252
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
 from them.

253
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:05,800
 This picture was taken by NASA over the Atlantic Ocean near Iceland.

254
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,440
 This one was actually a video, this is one shot from the video taken over England on

255
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,520
 Burnham on the Sea on February 11, 2009.

256
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:27,920
 This is something interesting that I feel or have the theory that the ancient British

257
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,220
 actually copied the UFOs.

258
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,800
 The archeological structures are carved in the ground in England.

259
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,880
 There's dozens of them, and these structures are over a mile long.

260
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,800
 This is how they're made, these ditches are carved out, and if you think about the type

261
00:18:51,800 --> 00:19:02,280
 of energy that it takes to make what amounts to a two mile around section of these ditches,

262
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:10,400
 the British archeologists call them curses because they remind them of kind of a racetrack,

263
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:19,560
 but I suggest that they, in fact, show that the craft had been there in ancient times.

264
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:27,320
 There's another picture of one, the Stonehenge curses, and as you see outlined on the ground.

265
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,840
 This is right in the Stonehenge area.

266
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:40,160
 This is one of the typical disc-shaped craft, and they built these huge hills in England.

267
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,760
 The question is why were they built?

268
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:50,480
 It happens that the disc-shaped aircraft seem to be able to power up by the energy inside

269
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,480
 the hills and the electrical energy coming down.

270
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,680
 Next.

271
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,880
 We feel that it's something like the cargo coat in World War II.

272
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:16,160
 The natives in the South Pacific made shapes of aircraft on the ground and that the British

273
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,880
 in the ancient times may have done the same thing.

274
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,000
 Next.

275
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 This is one of the better craft pictures taken in Cumberland, Rhode Island on July 3rd, 1967,

276
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:40,200
 and this was colorized, and the windows put in next.

277
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:50,440
 One Navy chief petty officer, flight engineer with 10,000 hours, had also seen a UFO, and

278
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:59,720
 he said that cigar-shaped craft was twice the size of two aircraft carriers.

279
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:08,400
 And the object moved east at about 100 knots and was a huge aircraft.

280
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,660
 A similar one was seen by two pilots on two different airlines over the English Channel

281
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,680
 on April 23rd, 2007.

282
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
 Next.

283
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:29,560
 Captain Ray Bauer in his Ernie aircraft and a Blue Island pilot had seen these UFOs and

284
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
 reported them.

285
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,560
 Maybe you have a little bit less than a minute left.

286
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
 Okay.

287
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,560
 Here's Captain Bauer reporting it in 2007.

288
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
 Next.

289
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,920
 And here's a close-up of one taken in France just recently.

290
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,440
 Any case, these spacecraft occasionally roam our skies.

291
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,080
 They're seen by many people, by many pilots and air crews, and I think they've been here

292
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,600
 for thousands of years, and our ancestors made structures on the ground to remind us

293
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,320
 that they had actually been here.

294
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:15,640
 I've been interested in UFOs ever since, and I'd like to dedicate this talk to my two daughters

295
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,920
 that recently passed away.

296
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,920
 Thank you.

297
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:30,560
 Next, go to Mr. Jim Grant.

298
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
 Yes.

299
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:37,640
 I wanted to thank all the serious researchers that have been trying to get this information

300
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,760
 out for years, and thanks for you all showing up today.

301
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:49,520
 And my background is I've been a pilot for, started taking lessons when I was 10 years

302
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
 old.

303
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:58,040
 I've been an airline captain for 31 years, flying 46 years, and have over 32,000 flight

304
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,400
 hours rated as a captain, 747s.

305
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,600
 Most Boeing jets and Airbus, I'm also a helicopter instructor and instructor in gliders and balloons

306
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,360
 and such.

307
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,080
 Got interested in this subject in 1962 when I was reaching for a book on flying in a small

308
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:25,920
 library and a book fell out called Flying Saucer's Top Secret by Major Donald Kehoe,

309
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:32,560
 and he was one of the ringleaders in helping get a lot of this information out, and most

310
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:41,600
 of his books are credible, professional people that were, you know, people that were trained

311
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,360
 to know what they were seeing, pilots and astronomers, ground observers, such.

312
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,400
 And I thought it was science fiction when I first picked it up, so that's how I got

313
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,760
 started in this field, and it has not been an easy field.

314
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,200
 Unfortunately, after all these years, it still hasn't changed much.

315
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:10,120
 I wish it had as far as military or civilian pilots of how they're treated as far as when

316
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,400
 they see something.

317
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,480
 I'll give you an example of things that are seen but not talked about.

318
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,800
 A friend of mine was a flight engineer, 747, with an air carrier I was flying for at the

319
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:30,960
 time, and they were over the Pacific, and they had a similar sighting to what happened

320
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,480
 with the Japan Airlines flight in 1986, but this was in 1980.

321
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,040
 There was no radar, and my friend came up to me later after his trip, and he said, "You

322
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,400
 don't believe what we saw.

323
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,120
 This thing was bigger than an aircraft carrier," and he said, "We were obviously flying a

324
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
 747.

325
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,440
 They were heading to Norita.

326
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,280
 They were told to park the aircraft when they got there, and then they were debriefed, told

327
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,760
 never to talk about it."

328
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,680
 There are many cases like this of pilots coming up to talk to me, because they know I've kind

329
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:16,440
 of stuck my neck out more than most pilots, because I've been very lucky to make some

330
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,320
 contacts with different people around the world that should know what they're talking

331
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
 about.

332
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:28,320
 Some of them were astronauts, some cosmonauts, some generals, and I usually don't get into

333
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,840
 what I've been told, and they tell me what they know in closed-door sessions, and it's

334
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,480
 almost verbatim what I've been told before.

335
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:46,280
 It's almost astounding how many people are in the know on this subject, and they're afraid.

336
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,800
 It's not so much I find out afraid for losing their retirement, and some of them are, or

337
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:58,280
 their status in life, but they're more afraid for their families.

338
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,960
 So I'm not going to get in too much into that aspect, but what happened to me as far as

339
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:14,280
 I had a sighting over New Mexico, 1995, ironically, I had just finished talking to my first officer

340
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,720
 about this subject, which I had been told sometimes it wasn't a good idea.

341
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,400
 He said, "I've been flying 25 years, I've never seen anything."

342
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:30,480
 He was an ex-military tanker pilot, and his lips had barely stopped moving when the cockpit

343
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,700
 was at dusk, so it was starting to get dark.

344
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,880
 The cockpit started almost getting the shade of bluish green.

345
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:44,760
 I looked off to the left, and I thought the air traffic controllers had misinformed us

346
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,720
 about any traffic nearby this.

347
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,840
 It looked a lot closer than it was.

348
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:56,140
 It was oval-shaped, bluish green, moving very quickly, and they had no radar contact on

349
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,920
 this, military or civilian.

350
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,440
 We were just about 100 miles past Albuquerque.

351
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,800
 I looked to my first officer, he looked like he had just found out his wife was having

352
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:12,760
 an affair, and the difficult scenario with this is we got on the ground.

353
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,800
 Well, there were four other airliners in the area, the controller asked, "Does anybody

354
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 want to report it?"

355
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,640
 He said, "No, it's just a meteor."

356
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,040
 We had seen a flash of white light, and the thing took off at about a 45-degree angle

357
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,400
 back into space.

358
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,240
 I chimed in on the radio, I said, "When does a meteor go back up?"

359
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,560
 When we got to the ground, he didn't want to talk about it, didn't want to report it,

360
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:48,880
 and he never flew with me again, but this is a sad scenario because this happens so

361
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,560
 much.

362
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,520
 Pilots come up and tell me what they've seen, many in areas over the ocean where there is

363
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,600
 no radar, and some of these fighter pilots are pretty brave guys.

364
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,000
 They fought in wars, and yet they're afraid of mentioning this, mostly for fear of ridicule.

365
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:16,960
 I have been invited in to talk with a small group of high-level people, a couple of senators,

366
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,800
 and Gordon Cooper, the astronaut, one of our original seven, and Edgar Mitchell are friends

367
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,800
 of mine, and I'm really proud of the effort they put out trying to get this information

368
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:33,520
 out because it is very hard to get to the truth on this subject, which is ridiculed

369
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,440
 so much, but it's also so hard to get to the proof, and that's what everybody's after,

370
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,720
 and I have found out why this proof is so hard to get after, and there's so much more

371
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,440
 I could share, but when you're down to just a few minutes, you have to almost be a top

372
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,000
 40 disc jockey to get through this.

373
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,880
 But you've got a couple more minutes, so please tell us that.

374
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,400
 Three minutes.

375
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,000
 One thing, you'd think the government doesn't take this seriously, I don't know if you've

376
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,960
 heard about this book.

377
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,000
 I told the History Channel about it back when it first came out, it first came out in '78,

378
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,960
 but in 1992, the second edition came out and they added the section, this is the fire officer's

379
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,880
 guide to disaster control for our federal and civilian fire disaster people for atomic

380
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,840
 wars or whatever, and how to deal with it.

381
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,840
 It's written by Navy personnel, one's an attorney, one's a PhD, and the main section that they

382
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:44,000
 revised in 1992 was on the UFO threat of fact, and it tells the firefighters who are usually

383
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,800
 first on the scene how to deal with the crashed UFO, possibly dead extraterrestrials or live

384
00:29:50,800 --> 00:30:00,360
 aliens, and how to deal with the crowd situation, radiation problems, and that's that information.

385
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:07,220
 So it's a very interesting addition that they added in 1992 on this book.

386
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:16,240
 There are some very important books that people always ask me, because after I got involved

387
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,400
 talking about this subject to some co-pilots, I was turned in and I was evaluated for four

388
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,560
 days of flight testing, and everything went smooth, and in fact, the chief pilot said,

389
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,080
 "Well, you got through okay, you get to keep your job, and I'm very interested in this

390
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
 subject now.

391
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,880
 It looks like there's more to this than I thought."

392
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,840
 So we used to have long talks about this, and through that situation, I was so upset

393
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,240
 about my freedom of speech rights after how I was treated as a pilot, and other pilots

394
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,120
 around the world have been treated, that I ended up getting the opportunity to do a five

395
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,360
 day a week live uncensored television show for almost three years.

396
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,560
 And we did just a little over 500 shows on this subject, and other mysteries that I found

397
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,520
 out regarding the ... The UFO subject is basically the tip of the iceberg.

398
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,840
 This stuff gets very deep, and I can understand, just like Stanton Friedman has said many,

399
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:23,440
 many times, of the reasons why this has been kept secret, it's much more involved than

400
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,720
 people realize who don't do their homework, because most people are so busy getting their

401
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,960
 kids to school, paying their mortgage, and their own box of reality, that a person convinced

402
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,680
 against their will is of the same opinion still.

403
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,240
 And all we can do is just keep trying, and hopefully the press will have more serious

404
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,480
 articles, and the articles have been published this week, unfortunately, that put a bad frame

405
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,600
 on the seriousness of this subject.

406
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,160
 You've got about 30 seconds.

407
00:31:53,160 --> 00:32:00,160
 And I hope the pilots of the world that are listening will not be afraid to tell what

408
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,720
 they see, and not fear the ridicule, because this has got to end after so many years of

409
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
 this.

410
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,880
 But once again, I do recommend, if somebody is interested in this subject, I always recommend

411
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,600
 Richard Dolan's books, Excellent Research, Linda Moulton Howell's books, Stanton Friedman's

412
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:24,000
 books, Timothy Good's book called Above Top Secret, and Brad Steiger's book, The Rainbow

413
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,600
 Conspiracy, and also Michael Hesselman's book, The Secret History of UFOs.

414
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
 There are many others.

415
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,840
 I have a collection of over probably 3,000 UFO books at my house, and hundreds and hundreds

416
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,680
 of videos.

417
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,320
 We all can't be crazy.

418
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
 Thank you for your time.

419
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:48,320
 Thank you very much.

420
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,720
 Now, if we could hear from Lieutenant Colonel Richard French.

421
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
 I am Lieutenant Colonel Richard French.

422
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,880
 I was a fighter pilot in both Korea and Vietnam.

423
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:08,880
 During a number of my flights, a number of flights of mine, I have a little trouble reading

424
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,440
 this because it's been freehand written, and I'm having a little trouble picking it up,

425
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,440
 witnesses to the sightings of a number of UFOs.

426
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,320
 I'm going to go to the first one that stands out most in my mind.

427
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,840
 I was at Spandau in Germany when I received a telephone call from the OSI district commander

428
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,360
 telling me to go investigate a reported UFO in the water in Newfoundland.

429
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:50,600
 Approximately four hours later, I arrived to find a large crowd on the wharf, and there

430
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,160
 were divers in the water.

431
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,780
 The water was very clear.

432
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,200
 You could see down as much as 200 feet in it.

433
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:10,480
 What I saw down there were two UFOs parked side by side, but I couldn't see anyone around

434
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,800
 either one of them.

435
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:22,800
 Then a little later, someone moved to one of the UFO occupants, and I guess go ahead

436
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,920
 and call them what they are, the alien.

437
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,200
 Moved over to the side and came into my line of sight.

438
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,000
 Very soon after that, he came out of the water going approximately 100 miles an hour.

439
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,160
 As soon as he broke the surface of the water, he increased his speed to approximately 2,500

440
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,740
 miles an hour and quickly went out of sight.

441
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,560
 He was gone for about 15 or 20 minutes.

442
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,640
 He came right back, right, went and slowed down very much, went in the water again at

443
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:07,200
 about 100 miles an hour, went on down to ... He and the other one, you could see them working

444
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,760
 on the UFOs.

445
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:23,440
 After about approximately 2 hours of apparently performing maintenance on the UFOs, the two

446
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:32,160
 of them took off together again, left the water at about 100 miles an hour, immediately accelerated

447
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:42,720
 to well over 2,500 miles an hour, went virtually straight up and disappeared.

448
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:53,080
 The speeds that I reported this, I arrived at the figures simply by triangulation and

449
00:35:53,080 --> 00:36:01,440
 in that I can take things that were at a known distance and then calculate based on where

450
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,480
 they were and how long it took them to get to another place is what I use as a standard

451
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,800
 for estimating their speed.

452
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,480
 In another instance, I was on my way to Libya.

453
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:31,080
 Again, I was out over the water just about three miles offshore of the northern extreme

454
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,720
 of the Mediterranean Sea.

455
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:43,880
 I looked up to my left and five miles away I saw a lighted UFO.

456
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,520
 I went down into the ... It went down into the center of Mount Blanc.

457
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,520
 If you know where Mount Blanc is in France, anyway, it went down into the center of Mount

458
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
 Blanc.

459
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,520
 It was down there for approximately 15 minutes and turned around and came right back out.

460
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:12,280
 Since then, I have noticed that there's something about the inside of volcanoes that seems to

461
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:21,880
 attract them and in discussing that with other people, we reached this conclusion that whether

462
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,640
 it's right or wrong, this is the closest we can get to a logical reason for why they do

463
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,820
 that.

464
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:38,520
 They may very well be and have been for some time actually defending the earth because

465
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,360
 what other purpose would they have for it?

466
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,240
 We have no way of knowing whether they are doing something constructive because I'm certain

467
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,920
 that they wouldn't risk their equipment and lives and like that if they didn't have a

468
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,480
 useful purpose for it.

469
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:05,640
 I just mentioned in others, I saw the same thing in Hawaii and again, the live volcano

470
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,720
 at Kiliwale, which I'm sure you're familiar with, but anyway, it went down inside of that.

471
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:27,600
 I saw them again when I was down in Sicily and they went down inside of the volcano that's,

472
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:37,920
 you know, the famous one that has, when it erupted, it lay waste to about a hundred square

473
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,480
 miles of land.

474
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,640
 In all cases, the UFOs, they've all been the same shape.

475
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:57,760
 They've all been the cigar shape type and in all cases where I was able to see the aliens,

476
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,360
 they were what we call grays, you've probably heard them mentioned by other people that

477
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:09,640
 are reporting in this same convention.

478
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:18,440
 The last that I personally witnessed happened right in Sedona where I lived quite recently

479
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:25,320
 and what happened, I used to go out in the early evening, I'd go out on my back patio

480
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,800
 and you know, look at the stars and the scenery in Sedona is spectacular as you may know if

481
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,920
 you've been there.

482
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:41,880
 But anyway, I saw this one go by but when it went by, I didn't think it was a UFO.

483
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:49,080
 The thing I thought was that it was simply a meteorite but you know, I watched it and

484
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:55,520
 it went from north to south and disappeared and I thought, "Well, that's a meteorite."

485
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,160
 And I believed that until the thing turned 180 degrees and flew back.

486
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,180
 Well, that immediately convinced me that that was something that meteorites don't normally

487
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,720
 do and that concludes my speech, gentlemen.

488
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,160
 Thank you very much.

489
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,480
 Thank you very much.

490
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,600
 Mr. Steve Allen, would you proceed?

491
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,680
 Thank you.

492
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,080
 Good morning distinguished members of the panel.

493
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,800
 Greetings from the Lone Star State.

494
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,320
 Thank you for taking time to investigate.

495
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,480
 I hope it'll be rewarding.

496
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,080
 My name is Steve Allen.

497
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
 Please forgive me.

498
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,120
 I'm not a public speaker so I'll do the best I can.

499
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,440
 In fact, I'm just an old country boy so bear with me.

500
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,400
 I live near Stephenville, Texas.

501
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,520
 I'm the owner of a transportation company.

502
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,800
 I'm a private pilot of an aircraft.

503
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,560
 Been flying most of my life.

504
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,940
 I'm a witness to what I feel and others have said could very well be the most significant

505
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,520
 sighting in history.

506
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,280
 Why you ask?

507
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:04,240
 Four reasons, multiple witnesses including business owners, former FAA air traffic controllers,

508
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,240
 ranch and law enforcement.

509
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,720
 There have been multiple witnesses of events in the past but this time, well, you know,

510
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,560
 many may not remember all details, distort the facts and even lie to you.

511
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,120
 But this time there is a very comprehensive radar report compiled from several government

512
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,840
 radars.

513
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,080
 The radars have no hidden agenda and no emotion.

514
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,400
 It simply reports what it sees.

515
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,360
 Here's my story.

516
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:41,080
 On the evening of January the 8th, 2008, at 6.15 p.m. in Selden, Texas, just outside of

517
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:47,880
 Stephenville at my friend's home, Mike Odom, I witnessed a set of four very bright high

518
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,800
 intensity lights flying extremely fast in a very low altitude, what seemed to be coming

519
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,120
 directly at us, flying from east to west.

520
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,520
 I knew immediately this is nothing I had ever seen.

521
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,840
 I paid very close attention to all details.

522
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,960
 I had a feeling this would be a historic event.

523
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:14,160
 The object appeared to be very large, about a half a mile wide and close to a mile long.

524
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:21,000
 The lights came past us at approximately 3,000 feet AGL, that's above ground level.

525
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,940
 It was up close and personal.

526
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,340
 This was not something way out in the heavens, but it was right there before our eyes.

527
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:34,000
 It was totally silent, made no wind noise, no engine noise, nothing.

528
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,680
 As the aircraft traveled past us, I had a strange feeling they were aware we were watching

529
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,360
 them and they were aware of us as well.

530
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,560
 Never had had that feeling before.

531
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,640
 So as the object passed by us, you could see seven extremely bright lights in the rear of

532
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,800
 the craft, all in a horizontal fashion, blinking in no particular order.

533
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,560
 The object came to a complete stop over Stephenville, Texas, about three to four miles away.

534
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,560
 The seven lights reconfigured into an arch shape like the top of a football, then to

535
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,920
 a vertical shape, then in a split second they duplicated with two sets of seven lights.

536
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,800
 In another brief moment they burst into light colored flames, almost white in color, which

537
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,300
 looked to be contained in a large box or a rectangle shape.

538
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,820
 Then about three or four seconds later they simply disappeared.

539
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,200
 Did not streak off in the distance, but simply disappeared.

540
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,320
 I was amazed.

541
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,960
 One of the members of our party, a rural mail carrier named Lance Jones abruptly left the

542
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,800
 scene after the event.

543
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,640
 All to our disbelief, we ran into my friend's home, Mike Odom, which had witnessed the event

544
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,960
 as well and told his wife Claudette.

545
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,400
 She doubted us and wanted to call Lance Jones, the mail carrier, to verify our story.

546
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,560
 We invited her to do so.

547
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:05,640
 Claudette telephoned Mr. Jones and he instructed us to run back outside and it was coming back.

548
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,200
 We bolted out the door.

549
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,560
 Sure enough, this time the object was traveling from west to east at a very high rate of speed.

550
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,880
 But I could hear the roar of jets in the immediate distance.

551
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,760
 Then a moment later, sure enough, the object had two F-16s in hot pursuit, full afterburner.

552
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,260
 The flames were protruding after the aircrafts.

553
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,600
 They were down on the deck and very close to us.

554
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,060
 They shook the ground and rattled the windows.

555
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,200
 The object was much closer than first sighted moments before.

556
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,680
 We stood there silently in amazement and watched the object with the jets chasing speed off

557
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,360
 over the distance into the horizon.

558
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:53,060
 The next morning, I reported the event to my local airport where I hangar my aircraft.

559
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,920
 After they made several calls, they were unable to find out anything.

560
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,880
 Then I contacted the local newspaper, like opening a Pandora's box.

561
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,520
 That's when the world found out about the event.

562
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,960
 I made the dire mistake of putting my telephone number in the article.

563
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,360
 I received many phone calls daily with no less than 60 calls per day from actual witnesses.

564
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,180
 All of the people that had witnessed the event, some were willing to come forward with their

565
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,620
 story and some would not.

566
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:32,480
 In the next few days, we were all on the local news channels, CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox.

567
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,280
 Then four days after the event, Larry King Show and several days after that, O'Reilly

568
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:44,640
 Factor, Good Morning America, Primetime, Peter Jennings, just to name a few.

569
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:51,240
 National Geographic History Channel, Discovery Channel, just to name a few more, made productions

570
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,400
 centered around the event.

571
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:59,600
 In the early stages, Angela Joyner from the local newspaper, Empire Tribune, or ET for

572
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:06,560
 short, how ironic, contacted Major Carl Lewis at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base

573
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,200
 in Fort Worth.

574
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,940
 He consistently denied any of the aircraft in the area and attempted to explain it away.

575
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,920
 He offered several possible scenarios, but none were plausible.

576
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,400
 Ten days later, lo and behold, a press release stating they did in fact have 10 F-16s in

577
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,200
 the area.

578
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,280
 Then came Robert Powell and Glenn Schultz.

579
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,800
 They filed several Freedom of Information Act documents.

580
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:39,640
 They compiled the radar data hits in the millions in the Schultz-Powell report.

581
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,200
 Sure enough, a very detailed, comprehensive report emerged.

582
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:50,200
 There it was, an unidentified aircraft with no transponder traveling from east to west

583
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,800
 at 1,900 to 2,100 miles an hour.

584
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,640
 Then in less than ten seconds, slowing to a speed of less than 50 miles an hour over

585
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,600
 Stephenville, Texas.

586
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,280
 What could do this?

587
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:09,020
 Then the object reversed course and traveling from east to west with the two F-16s in pursuit.

588
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,000
 What else did the radar report show?

589
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,680
 Well, eight additional F-16s, four F-16s on either side of the aircraft attempting to

590
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,600
 flank the object.

591
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,720
 Also an AWACS, Airborne Weather Command Center, that's the aircraft with the giant frisbee-like

592
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,200
 radar on its rear at 41,000 foot, circling the area for over four hours.

593
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,700
 Powell and Schultz also received copies of the F-16 log books.

594
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,540
 Many had been redacted to cover up what.

595
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:45,200
 The craft ended up ten miles from the former President Bush's Western White House in Crawford,

596
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,200
 Texas.

597
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,240
 Then we had no more radar info.

598
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,920
 We do not know.

599
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:57,280
 All I do know is what I observed this event, well, did not need to be a trained observer,

600
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,040
 a pilot, or anything else to describe it.

601
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,380
 A first grader could have reported this.

602
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,440
 To me, all this is very concerning.

603
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,820
 It has forever been etched into my brain, has affected my life in many ways, mostly

604
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:15,100
 for the good, more questions than answers.

605
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,960
 What could have outperformed our best aircraft?

606
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,460
 Why were they chasing it with vengeance?

607
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,520
 It is a danger to myself or others while flying.

608
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,080
 Do they mean us harm?

609
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,760
 I think we all have more questions than answers.

610
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,600
 Myself and the public respectfully demands answers.

611
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:39,720
 Hopefully you will be able to help us.

612
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,440
 [applause]

613
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,120
 Okay, well, thank you very much, witnesses.

614
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:56,040
 We will have ten minutes for questioning from each member of the panel, and if any would

615
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:02,400
 like to reserve some of their time on the first round, we will hopefully get two rounds

616
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,400
 in, if that is possible.

617
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:14,800
 Mr. Callahan would like to start and ask you a little more context on that meeting in the

618
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,800
 FAA.

619
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,320
 Where was it and what was the year you mentioned the Reagan administration?

620
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,640
 I would just like to put this, your testimony, a little more context so I understand it just

621
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
 a little bit better.

622
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:33,400
 Well, at FAA headquarters, 800 Independence, the administrator is on the 10th floor.

623
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,880
 On the 10th floor, he has what we call a round room, similar to what the President has.

624
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:47,120
 He had set up a meeting for us to go in that room, and also had a big TV screen that comes

625
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:52,320
 out of the wall, similar to what you have up here.

626
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,760
 The people that were there were the three scientists, the three CIA guys, a bunch of

627
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
 grunts.

628
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,400
 I brought up 22 experts from the area.

629
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,120
 They watched the video, and I have got the original copy of the video here, in case you

630
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,120
 guys are ever interested.

631
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,760
 I have got the voice tapes from the military.

632
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:16,000
 There were probably, what, about 30 to 40 people in attendance at that briefing?

633
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,920
 Yeah, that is pretty close, yeah.

634
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,040
 Let me ask you this question.

635
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:35,160
 When was the first time, that happened, which year, '88, '86, if you can remember.

636
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,420
 And approximations are just fine here.

637
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:44,480
 When was the first time you were able to, or that you felt comfortable, or in fact under

638
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,040
 any sort of sense, talk about this openly to let people know what you witnessed at that

639
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,040
 briefing?

640
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,340
 Well, I do not have any problems being comfortable any time I am talking.

641
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,520
 So you did it immediately, I take it.

642
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,520
 Yeah.

643
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,880
 My wife is one of those engineers, software engineers, and after I spoke to the administrator

644
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,120
 on the way home, I told her what we had seen up at Lang City.

645
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:13,200
 I played the tape at home, and she is one of those guys, if you asked her what time

646
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,320
 it was, she would tell you how to build a watch first.

647
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,780
 Well, she is watching the TV screen at home, and she is telling me what we are looking

648
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,200
 at and how that target got there and got there.

649
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,560
 So besides your wife, who else did you tell about this event?

650
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:36,040
 And let me just preface that with, were you asked by anybody, the CIA, the three CIA gentlemen,

651
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,760
 not to talk about the briefing, or?

652
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,400
 Well, they made a comment, but they were talking to the people I brought up.

653
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,900
 So in other words, you, okay.

654
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,160
 As far as I was concerned, they were not talking to me.

655
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,160
 I understand.

656
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,360
 And, you know, okay, I appreciate that.

657
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:58,320
 I would like to just ask Jim Courant to follow up a few questions on what you testified.

658
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:05,200
 Let's see, the sighting you had was in 1995, I understand.

659
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,200
 Yes.

660
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:12,240
 Did you have any other sightings in your, was it 40 years experience as an airline pilot

661
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,280
 that you mentioned, or 30 to 40 years?

662
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,200
 Flying as an airline pilot since 1971.

663
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,760
 So over 40 years experience.

664
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,280
 Any other sightings?

665
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,840
 Yeah.

666
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:34,120
 There were, it was unusual, but at two different locations, a week apart in the middle of the

667
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,120
 night.

668
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:41,400
 And both times I had two different co-pilots, and they were ironically both ex-tanker pilots,

669
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,880
 so they knew what a tanker operation looks like at night.

670
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:54,480
 And we were, you know, probably around 35,000 feet, 32,000, the other incident.

671
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,840
 One was over Montana, one over Georgia.

672
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,640
 Two in the morning, the first one a little past 3.30 in the morning, the other one, both

673
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,960
 times no radar contact.

674
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:12,680
 They were ironically very similar, I'd never heard of these type of shapes before as far

675
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,840
 as that high up, but in my research.

676
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:23,040
 But they were like glowing orbs, three of them in formation, and they were just hovering.

677
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,920
 And we're cruising along about 450 miles an hour, and like I said before, I'm a helicopter

678
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,440
 instructor, so obviously a helicopter can't hover that high.

679
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:41,440
 But I must say, with all this, most of what people are seeing are aerial phenomena, maybe

680
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,720
 black projects from our government.

681
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
 So a very small percentage.

682
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,040
 Do you think it might be able to be explained?

683
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:56,640
 It could be something, of course this was back in 19, would have been 1985, or actually

684
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:03,160
 was around '85, '86, but we didn't have these drones like we have now, but I don't even

685
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,920
 think they fly that high.

686
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,120
 But these things were just hovering there, stationary, and then they just slowly turned

687
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,880
 to the left and started flying off.

688
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,600
 And both times when we asked the controllers, "Do you have anything on the radar?"

689
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,160
 And they said, "We show no traffic in your ART CAS," which is our traffic avoidance system

690
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
 never went off.

691
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:28,080
 And I'm going to get back to this radar question, but I'd like to reserve the balance of my

692
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,480
 time to ask questions.

693
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,760
 So I'd like to call on Representative Woolsey to take this.

694
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,840
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

695
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,840
 Major Feiler.

696
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,840
 Yes.

697
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:47,240
 This is just out of the blue question, but I'd like to hear your perspective on it.

698
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:53,840
 And if any of the rest of you have ideas about this, two questions.

699
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:06,520
 One, could a UFO like a drone be controlled from the ground electronically, or two?

700
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:15,920
 Could UFO materials be developed here in the United States or on earth and tested against

701
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,400
 our military?

702
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,560
 I think it's possible, both are true.

703
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:31,400
 Ben Rich at Lockheed indicated that, in so many words, we had back-engineered some of

704
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,320
 these craft and we're now able to take ET home.

705
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:42,440
 The point is, is that apparently we're able to do a lot of things now, and probably some

706
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,280
 of what we're seeing is our own UFO, so to speak.

707
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:54,160
 Okay, now, but do you think we're learning from the UFOs and then we're building because

708
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,920
 of, I mean, or are we, was that us in the first place?

709
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:09,600
 Well, in a sense, I think anything's possible, but I also believe that we're being visited.

710
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,880
 Anybody else have a thought on that?

711
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:21,040
 I mean, you know, maybe we're way more clever than any of us realize, and my question would

712
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:28,000
 be, and it's just a push back on making sure we've covered all ground, are we setting,

713
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,620
 are Earthlings setting this up in the first place, you know, so that we find our way to

714
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:45,920
 outer space and for what could come with wars in outer space, but, or are the non-Earthlings

715
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,160
 coming to us and showing us what they know, and we're realizing we've got to compete?

716
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:58,080
 That's a good question, what you asked, because I never heard that before.

717
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:03,280
 The people I talk to that have been involved in the reverse engineering, they call it,

718
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:11,680
 with the UFOs that they captured, they could, by now, because it's been, what, 30 years

719
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:18,120
 or more, they could have developed a ship that they could be out practicing with or

720
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,880
 a group of ships.

721
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,880
 If you remember Dr. Mitchell, when he spoke, he said when he was en route to the moon,

722
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,320
 he looked out the left portal, I would call it a window, and he called down to NASA and

723
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:34,560
 said I'm now a fighter too, he thought that that spaceship flying along with them was

724
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:40,800
 made here in the United States and they were flight checking it, so it is possible that

725
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:49,240
 the United States has been making these UFOs, but I don't think they're going to tell us,

726
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,560
 and it's just one of those, how do you really know?

727
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,440
 Okay, anybody else, yes, Mr. Allen.

728
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,920
 Two points, why would our jets be chasing it and why would they let it out over a very

729
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,160
 densely populated area, if it was ours?

730
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,160
 Good questions, yes.

731
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,720
 Well, don't ask me, I'm asking you, I mean, why?

732
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:17,640
 Because possibly we want to find out if our military can keep up with what we've learned

733
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,640
 is out there.

734
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,640
 Could be a test.

735
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,780
 You'd think they'd test it out in the desert somewhere where there's no observers and media

736
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,780
 attention.

737
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:31,000
 But most of it has been over open space.

738
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,280
 The individual that gave me most of my flying lessons when I was younger was a Triple H

739
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:41,640
 in World War II, two books were written about him, one by a general from the Air Force Academy,

740
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:47,720
 his name was Colonel Leroy Gover, and he was one of the first 100 American pilots in World

741
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:53,040
 War II, he went over to Canada and then became commander of Eagle Squadron.

742
00:58:53,040 --> 00:59:00,000
 I knew him for 40 years, he was a pilot's pilot, and on his deathbed, three weeks before

743
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,160
 he passed on, I gave him a copy of Colonel Corso's book, The Day After Roswell, and he

744
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:12,840
 said I don't know a whole lot about certain aspects of this book, if it's all true, but

745
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:18,360
 I can tell you from what I was involved with, the people I knew, because he was with the

746
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:23,680
 Army Air Corps which later the same year as the alleged incident in Roswell happened,

747
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:30,260
 the Air Force was formed along with the United Nations and other developments, but he confirmed

748
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:40,720
 that in his words, and I never heard this man lie, he said they were androgynous, they

749
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:47,160
 didn't know their full technological capabilities at that time, at least one of them survived,

750
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:52,600
 they didn't know their full psychological makeup, or where they were from, or what this

751
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,480
 was all about, this was at this time.

752
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,520
 So that's just one other deathbed statement, he was a good friend, and so was Gordon Cooper

753
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,680
 who basically made similar statements the years that I knew him.

754
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:12,560
 So I'm going to ask a very short question of you, Jim, because it's appropriate at this

755
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:20,440
 point, and then I'm going to waive the rest of my time until later.

756
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:28,120
 Has your credibility been questioned because you were a believer before you were part of

757
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,120
 a sighting?

758
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:35,680
 People say oh yeah, well he wanted that to happen, so he made it happen in his mind.

759
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:42,360
 Amazingly enough, that hasn't come up in discussion, but it's definitely something that I expected,

760
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,660
 but that hasn't been a problem.

761
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:52,080
 Okay, good, thank you very much, and I'll yield for the time being.

762
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:59,280
 Could we go to Representative Bartlett, please?

763
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,280
 Thank you very much.

764
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:08,160
 Mr. Kallen, the event that you describe is exactly the kind of thing that I think is

765
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,160
 most creditable.

766
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:14,180
 Let me understand, how many different people saw this?

767
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,600
 Saw the radar return?

768
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:21,600
 Well, are there not people that saw the craft and people that saw the radar returns both?

769
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:27,480
 No, the only ones that saw the craft was the Japanese pilot and the other two with them.

770
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,440
 Okay, so there were three people that saw the craft, all right, and how many people

771
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,320
 saw the radar?

772
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,520
 I don't know, 20, 30.

773
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,440
 Twenty-three people?

774
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,920
 These are the kinds of things that are just very difficult to explain away, where you

775
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,520
 have eyewitnesses and a radar track, and a real radar track, but apparently some of these

776
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,360
 things don't leave a radar track.

777
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:56,120
 The other day we had testimony from a pilot in South America that they can absorb bullets.

778
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,920
 Something that can absorb bullets can absorb radar, I would think.

779
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,680
 Well, the radar picks up all the traffic, but most people don't understand how the system

780
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,440
 works and that's what blows their mind.

781
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,920
 If you're an air traffic controller and you're working your sector in front of you, you've

782
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:16,000
 got 500 miles that you're taking care of, the antenna's going by every nine or 10 seconds

783
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,880
 and it picks up a primary target, which is the size of a pencil eraser, and it puts it

784
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,760
 on your scope right here.

785
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,000
 You could be working traffic going this way.

786
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,320
 When that target shows up, we don't know who it is, and you're going to look at that and

787
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,400
 say, "Well, if he gets close to this guy, I'll do something intelligent."

788
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:39,920
 Ten seconds later, that target is over here someplace, nowhere near your traffic, so your

789
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,720
 mind says it must have been an 18 wheeler, it could be somebody low, I don't know what

790
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,720
 it was.

791
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:51,800
 The radar always picks up everything flying, but they go so fast that you don't recognize

792
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,800
 them.

793
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:58,000
 Today, to fly in the FAA system, if you're flying below 10,000, you have to stay at 250

794
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
 knots.

795
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,600
 If you're flying above 10,000 or above 18,000, you have to have a working transponder on

796
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,600
 your aircraft.

797
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,520
 That sends out a signal to the radar that says, "This is me," and it shows a different

798
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,520
 target on the screen.

799
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,920
 That's what we see when our people are flying.

800
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:21,320
 The UFOs don't have transponders, and they don't care about our rules and regulations,

801
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,320
 they come and go.

802
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,840
 I don't know how you're going to solve that problem.

803
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,560
 Are these records now available?

804
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:39,480
 Or have they been taken somewhere, the radar tracks?

805
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:44,560
 Oh, I've got a copy of the video I took.

806
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:51,240
 I also had the engineers at the tech center produce this chart, and I've got the papers

807
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:58,000
 that you can have, anybody that knows anything about automation, they could plot all the

808
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,960
 airplanes along the route of flight.

809
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,280
 The engineers that did this, they wrote down that this is the first time the UFO showed

810
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,320
 up, the first time the military's seen the UFO.

811
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:16,660
 The pilot at 02-27-06, NORAD called, they lost the target.

812
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:21,000
 They put two sheets of paper like this together on the board.

813
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,800
 They said, "This is what happens."

814
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:28,480
 Now, when I was talking to the engineers, the hardware and software engineers, I asked

815
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,880
 them to tell me what the target was alongside the 07-47.

816
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:38,200
 The hardware engineer says, "That target right there is a software problem.

817
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,400
 This one's a software."

818
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,540
 All the way down, the targets that showed up were software problems.

819
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:49,600
 The software engineer gets up and says, "This target here is a hardware problem.

820
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,480
 That's a hardware problem."

821
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,800
 My question to them was, "Well, if it's not a hardware problem and it's not a software

822
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,840
 problem, then what the hell is it?

823
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,080
 What are we looking at?"

824
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,200
 I'm still thinking it's a stealth bomber.

825
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:09,200
 One of them, he says, "My religion forbids me to believe in UFOs."

826
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,360
 I said, "Well, how do you know it ain't a stealth bomber?"

827
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,080
 They knew what they were looking at.

828
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,320
 They knew what they were putting down on the chart, and it was something that didn't belong

829
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,840
 here in the United States.

830
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:27,560
 If you go up and watch radar today, you won't see the UFOs he's shooting across the country.

831
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,120
 He has to slow down to somewhere around 600 knots.

832
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:37,680
 Then, if he stayed with the airline pilot, you would see the airline's target.

833
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,320
 The computer would tell you who it is, it's Transworld, whatever it is, what his speed

834
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,200
 was, what his altitude was as he's climbing and whatnot.

835
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,800
 All that data is on the screen, and next to it would be a dot.

836
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,560
 Unless the pilot said, "Hey, have you got somebody at my altitude?"

837
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,720
 We would never know that that's what it was.

838
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:02,240
 If he stayed a little bit above that aircraft, he wouldn't see it, wouldn't give it any thought,

839
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,680
 we would not know.

840
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,420
 Once the pilot says, "Hey, there's somebody at my altitude here."

841
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:14,320
 If it was a Learjet or a military aircraft, had the pilot said, "It looks like an F-106

842
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:19,320
 playing games out here," we would have tracked that little dot all the way until he landed,

843
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:24,160
 then we would have rolled him up for flying and controlled airspace without the FAA's

844
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,160
 approval.

845
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,360
 I think you've answered my next question.

846
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,760
 That was, how do those who say there is no such thing as this explain it away, and they're

847
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:36,560
 explaining it as either a software problem or a hardware problem?

848
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,560
 That's what the engineers did.

849
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,560
 I gather.

850
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,560
 Okay.

851
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,560
 Thank you very much.

852
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,640
 Dr. Schreifer, the hills in England and the energy from the hills, can you explain that

853
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,640
 a bit?

854
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,640
 Pardon me?

855
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,280
 You mentioned hills in England and energy from the hills.

856
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,280
 Yes.

857
01:06:51,280 --> 01:07:01,880
 We've done some indication that the UFOs may need some kind of electrical and magnetic

858
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,360
 energy.

859
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:09,200
 All over the world, there's pyramids or hills or mountainous terrain where they seem to

860
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:16,400
 be attracted to and have often been reported in landing on top of these pyramids, that

861
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,000
 kind of thing.

862
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,760
 We're assuming that they may use this as a power station.

863
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:30,960
 There's books out that indicate that the pyramids actually generate power, that they're power

864
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,720
 stations in some way.

865
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:41,120
 For example, right now, there's some 200 pyramids in China with flat tops to them, which make

866
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:44,720
 them ideal for a craft landing on them.

867
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,840
 The Chinese are declaring that they're some 10,000 years old.

868
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:54,840
 The question is, how did these huge pyramids be built when we were basically not much further

869
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,400
 along than cavemen?

870
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,400
 That's very interesting.

871
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:04,800
 Let me continue a little bit more with this, with Mr. Allen.

872
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:11,520
 You mentioned that they just disappeared?

873
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,600
 Yes, sir.

874
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,600
 Just in a flash.

875
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:18,640
 It didn't streak off or anything, it simply disappeared.

876
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:24,600
 When you saw it take off, there was no propulsion sound, there was no wind sound.

877
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,600
 Correct.

878
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,160
 No wind noise, no engine noise, nothing.

879
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:34,320
 Is anybody speculated on how a large object like that could move so rapidly through the

880
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,640
 air and have no wind noise?

881
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,960
 That's one of our questions, pure speculation.

882
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,240
 Were these tracked by radar?

883
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,240
 Yes, sir.

884
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,160
 Yes, that's a comprehensive radar report.

885
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:48,280
 I think you do have a copy of it.

886
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:53,640
 There's something tracked by radar, and people saw it, so you know it's there, and it moves

887
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,960
 very rapidly, and there's no propulsion sound, and there's no wind sound, there's no propulsion

888
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,720
 sound, I understand, because we don't know how they propel themselves if it's an anti-gravity

889
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,720
 thing or something.

890
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:09,760
 Obviously, there's going to be no propulsion sound, but you're going through the molecules.

891
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,760
 I don't understand that.

892
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,760
 Yes, sir.

893
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,760
 Colonel French.

894
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:21,640
 I apologize for this, because I had intended to discuss the Phoenix Lights, and by accident,

895
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,800
 I stepped over that page.

896
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,480
 Go ahead and take the rest of my time to discuss the Phoenix Lights.

897
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,480
 Go ahead.

898
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,480
 All right.

899
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,480
 What happened?

900
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,440
 This happened in 1997.

901
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:40,920
 I was with four friends, and we were up at an area called the Boulders, which is actually

902
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:51,360
 northern Scottsdale, and that was when the Phoenix Lights, where they were explaining

903
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:58,040
 what they were, was that they were actually targets for gunnery practice.

904
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:03,700
 Well, I knew better than that, and I was explaining to them why.

905
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:11,360
 Number one, one of those target, gunnery targets, they're a flare, and the flare burns for exactly

906
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,880
 one minute and 21 seconds.

907
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,320
 And another thing about them, a gunnery flare may go up or down.

908
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:27,960
 Now, the reason it would go up, it'll capture heat in the deployed area of the parachute,

909
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:33,600
 and it'll rise or it won't capture enough air in it, and then it'll descend and sit.

910
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,240
 So I knew, I knew then they couldn't be that.

911
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:41,720
 And I'm telling to my friends, you know, no, they got this all wrong.

912
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:48,320
 While I'm in the process of doing that, there was a low spot in the, well, it's a mountain

913
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,040
 range, but it's not an extreme one.

914
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:56,920
 And this UFO came through that cut, and of course there was no lights on it that I could

915
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,980
 see at that point.

916
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:05,000
 When it went by, and now it's going at this time at about 50 miles an hour, and descending

917
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:15,320
 slowly and headed in the direction of Tucson to the south, well, as it got past me in about

918
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:21,880
 probably 30 miles down, the lights out on the range, they didn't go out, they stayed

919
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,240
 on, but they started heading for Tucson.

920
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:31,840
 The UFO, now it went by, it made absolutely no sound.

921
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:40,000
 It was less than 100 yards from me, and you could hear absolutely nothing, yet the vehicle

922
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:48,480
 was actually nearly a mile long and approximately 60 feet in diameter.

923
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,240
 Again, silent, totally silent.

924
01:11:52,240 --> 01:12:02,520
 When it got in the vicinity of Tucson, the smaller UFOs that were reported to be parachuting,

925
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:11,320
 I mean parachute targets, they headed toward Tucson, and at that time I could see on the

926
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:20,000
 side of the UFO, like little doors open, they entered the other, we call them mother ships.

927
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,280
 Anyway, the smaller ones went into the mother ships, the mother ships went, when they got

928
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:34,320
 to Tucson, they very quietly disappeared, went right up and out and gone.

929
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,320
 Thank you so much.

930
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:40,920
 I go to Representative Pooley.

931
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,520
 First of all, thank you for your testimony.

932
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:51,920
 Jim, I'd like to ask you a question.

933
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:58,840
 Did people not talk about this because they were afraid for their families?

934
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:07,240
 When did people, when did you start talking to other people about what you saw, what happened?

935
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:14,800
 Probably more after the TV show, UFO Cover Up Live in 1988.

936
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:22,360
 It was kind of the beginning of the, from what I understand, a slow education process

937
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:28,760
 for modern times of the public, and there's been, since then it's been easier to talk

938
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,280
 about this situation with other crew.

939
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:39,560
 Crew members do come up, they've seen me on TV, and they say, "I'm still afraid to talk

940
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:44,040
 about it, but let me tell you what happened to me or my father when he was in the military

941
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,560
 or this or that."

942
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:51,400
 But I'm glad that these shows for the last 20 years on Discovery Channel, Learning Channel,

943
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:57,360
 even the show recently that's a series, Ancient Aliens.

944
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:03,760
 If you look at things like the Eco Stones of Ica, Peru, very fascinating case with the

945
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,120
 50,000 Eco Stones, amazing.

946
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:13,160
 I've traveled the world studying these things, and it just gets deeper and deeper and more

947
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,520
 amazing.

948
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:20,880
 But one of the problems with people not being able to accept this, and it is a major issue,

949
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:26,320
 is if these entities are getting here, which I, as a person, believe they are, based on

950
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,120
 my research, they've conquered gravity.

951
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,760
 Once you conquer gravity, you conquer everything.

952
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,840
 So there goes the fossil fuel-based economy of the world, and we can go on and on.

953
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,840
 The religious issues are pretty relevant.

954
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:47,400
 But Carl Sagan on his show, Cosmos, he admitted with 200 billion stars out there in the Drake

955
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,000
 Equation, they must be out there, but they can't get here.

956
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,440
 And what's locking that problem is the theory of relativity with Einstein.

957
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:02,360
 So what you really have to kind of take a look is maybe there's something beyond the

958
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:08,640
 theory of relativity, and what's faster than the speed of light, thought, from what I understand

959
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:16,480
 from scientists that have been involved with these projects is they've, they're thousands

960
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:21,280
 of years ahead of us, probably, and they've definitely used some kind of incredible thought

961
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:28,520
 process, some kind of inversion energy process to get here, and they basically warp time.

962
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:35,080
 So as profound as it sounds, if you told me that 10 years ago, people would be bumping

963
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:40,600
 into themselves in an airport terminal like zombies looking down at these devices there,

964
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:44,200
 these cell phones, I wouldn't have believed it.

965
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,120
 And so anything's possible.

966
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:52,720
 But we do have, based on what I understand, aircraft called a TR-3B.

967
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:58,080
 There's probably either many other advanced craft that we've developed at some of these

968
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:07,240
 installations like 51 or Pine Gap in Australia, possibly, that do hover silently, and they

969
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:14,000
 can duplicate some of the technology, but we haven't been able to replicate it 100%.

970
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
 Thank you.

971
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,760
 I don't know if anyone wants to volunteer for this question, but nobody talks about

972
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,760
 the sound.

973
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:31,920
 Are there no sounds that you heard when you saw a spaceship or saw a flying object?

974
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,920
 Did they make any sounds?

975
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:38,880
 So you have to be, is that why more pilots have seen them than anyone else because you're

976
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,680
 in the air space with them?

977
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,680
 Yes, Mr. Piler.

978
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,680
 I'd like to answer.

979
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:50,560
 I'm with the MUFON organization, and we investigate these sightings, and we get about a thousand

980
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:55,280
 sightings per month per month.

981
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:00,120
 And actually, I write about it in my filers' files, which I'm happy to send to anyone.

982
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:09,480
 I'm sending out 17,000 emails a week discussing these sightings that we're getting, but generally

983
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,280
 people say that there's no sound.

984
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:19,080
 Occasionally when the UFO goes right overhead, they can see it go right overhead just a few

985
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:28,920
 hundred feet above them, they'll hear what sounds like an electric motor, and that description

986
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:35,360
 has been given many times, sometimes a buzz sound, and it's very low, and obviously if

987
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:40,280
 you're in an aircraft you wouldn't hear it, or even if it's a little bit further away

988
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,280
 you wouldn't hear it.

989
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:48,200
 The point is that there apparently is, at least on some of the UFOs, a small, almost

990
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,080
 indistinct sound.

991
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:56,100
 And that's probably to do, like you mentioned, with the overcoming gravity, and it seems

992
01:17:56,100 --> 01:18:03,840
 to have a lot of electrical energy surrounding it, and not only radar has picked it up, but

993
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:11,960
 other types of instruments, for example, just your typical compass that you can buy.

994
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:18,680
 In any case, the UFOs nearby, it will usually turn the compass to directly point towards

995
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,680
 them.

996
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:24,280
 Can I give you just a little extra?

997
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,280
 Of course.

998
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:30,480
 Whenever I spoke, I was invited someplace to speak on TV, they always brought in this

999
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:37,440
 little Japanese guy who's on Channel 5, Michi Kuka or something like that, he would get

1000
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,840
 up and explain how it's impossible to go from one planet to the other, and he would explain

1001
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,560
 the thousands of light years.

1002
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:50,960
 Now a few months ago he was on Fox News, and sitting behind him was a picture of the Earth,

1003
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,980
 and they asked him what that was, and he says the Hubble telescope sent this picture back

1004
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,760
 the other day, last week.

1005
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:04,560
 He says this is a small planet similar to Earth, it has atmosphere, and it could probably

1006
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:10,360
 have life on it, and if they were a thousand years older than us, they may have developed

1007
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,360
 some type of travel.

1008
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:17,880
 A week or two later, he's back on there, and now there's a big Earth right behind him,

1009
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,920
 big Earth.

1010
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:27,160
 He says this planet came from the Hubble telescope, it is a hundred times bigger than Earth, and

1011
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:32,360
 it has atmosphere, and it could have life, and if they were one to two thousand years

1012
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:37,840
 older than us, they could have developed space travel, and they could do the wormholes, and

1013
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,120
 they could go from place to place.

1014
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,360
 And they said well what else does that tell you?

1015
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:48,840
 He says well the biggest thing it tells us is that the universe goes on forever.

1016
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,680
 Apparently they had thought before it was like the Earth was flat, and eventually you

1017
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:56,240
 would run out of the universe, but now he says it goes on forever.

1018
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:00,800
 And there's two planets that they have identified through the Hubble telescope that have been

1019
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,880
 there longer than us.

1020
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,160
 So you might want to consider that.

1021
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,160
 Okay.

1022
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:12,040
 May I make one closing remark?

1023
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,500
 Yes, of course.

1024
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:20,200
 Had I came in here, I was not a skeptic when I came in here, I already believed in them,

1025
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:25,000
 but I say very clearly that had I been a skeptic when I came in, I would have been convinced

1026
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:31,680
 by the simple testimony of my cohorts.

1027
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:48,200
 Let me say that the testimony I think has been outstanding, and your backgrounds and

1028
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:53,560
 where you come from, and the fact that you are willing to come forward and talk about

1029
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:59,040
 this I think is a credit to all of you, so thank you for doing that.

1030
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,040
 I have two minutes left, and I'm going to reserve my time.

1031
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,280
 Mr. Thayer?

1032
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,280
 Okay.

1033
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:08,320
 I'd like to ask Senator Gravel.

1034
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,760
 Two questions.

1035
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:18,200
 One when we look at the shape of the vehicles that have been observed, the two shapes stand

1036
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:24,200
 out, one is something flat like a disc, and the other is cigar-shaped.

1037
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:33,920
 Could the cigar-shaped, which is substantially different, could it be the angle of observation?

1038
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:44,060
 Because if you observe a disc shape at a certain angle, it looks cigar-shaped.

1039
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:52,880
 Could that be the case, and that we're talking more uniformly about disc shapes than disc

1040
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,200
 and cigar shapes?

1041
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,980
 Anybody could answer that.

1042
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:05,080
 One of the pilot reports was on the news for a while, but then the pilots were told to

1043
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,080
 not talk about it.

1044
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:10,560
 They never gave their names, but they were watching.

1045
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:17,400
 They were thousands of feet in the air, 737, and out of the clouds came this giant mile-long

1046
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,280
 cigar-shaped craft, and it was cigar-shaped.

1047
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:27,420
 They aren't disc-shaped, so unfortunately, the pilots never wanted to talk about it again

1048
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:33,520
 after it hit the news, and they played their voice tapes over the television, and they

1049
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,720
 took some heat for it, but thank God I've got Danny Sheehan over there to protect me

1050
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,400
 as a good attorney in case I get in trouble here.

1051
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:47,760
 You're talking about a cigar-shaped of a mile long.

1052
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,760
 Yeah.

1053
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,120
 We have dozens.

1054
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,040
 It could be a confusion of a contrail, which could be a mile long.

1055
01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:01,560
 No, and I know you're hearing reports of size of three aircraft carriers, or in my friend's

1056
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:06,840
 case over the Pacific, they said it was the size of an aircraft carrier, and they're in

1057
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,560
 a 747.

1058
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,680
 Are they Looney Tunes?

1059
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:16,000
 Are they pilots like this movie, Flight with Mr. Washington?

1060
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,240
 No, the pilots are very serious in their profession, and they know what they see.

1061
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:26,880
 I can understand where it might look like a disc, but they usually know if it's oval-shaped,

1062
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,060
 spear-shaped, or a mile long.

1063
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:35,880
 That's a big exaggeration that a pilot wouldn't make.

1064
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:44,520
 I have a boyhood friend who was a captain in Pan Am, and flew the largest of four.

1065
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:50,300
 The other thing I want to touch on, which really doesn't surprise me, but maybe a little

1066
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:55,160
 angers me, and that is the back engineering.

1067
01:23:55,160 --> 01:24:02,480
 I think you referred to somebody from Lockheed or Grumman or a company saying that they back-engineered

1068
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:08,480
 what was the debris, or whatever, they got their hands on through the government, and

1069
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,880
 they can take ET home.

1070
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:17,000
 That sounds like an exaggeration to me, because if there's a company that's developed a propulsion

1071
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:25,880
 system equal to what's been observed by all of our witnesses, and based upon Dr. Greer's

1072
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:37,360
 testimony, we just alter life on this planet if that form of energy is known.

1073
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:46,120
 For somebody who's an engineer at a major contracting firm can boast to you or anybody

1074
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:52,520
 that we can take ET home, then that son of a gun is denying the planet something very

1075
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:59,520
 vital, and that's what angers me.

1076
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,320
 I question, I think it's boastfulness, but correct me, I give you the opportunity to

1077
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:09,880
 correct me, was the person who told you that they could take ET home, was he Looney Tunes,

1078
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,000
 or was he a serious engineer, or was he just boasting in your judgment?

1079
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,240
 Well, he's worked for Lockheed, he was head of Skunk Works, he was in a very important

1080
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:27,560
 position, and I have friends who were at the briefing where he said this, Jan Harzen at

1081
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:33,120
 UCLA, and he said it in front of like a hundred engineers.

1082
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,060
 I don't know if he was bragging or not, but he said it very clearly.

1083
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:42,480
 But the implications of that, now I've met people in very high places that are Looney

1084
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,480
 Tunes.

1085
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:44,480
 Well, I know.

1086
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:51,240
 That's not a criteria of credibility, you know, all that is is that he's walking around

1087
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:57,920
 or she's walking around, but the implication of that is what really must be focused on,

1088
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:04,400
 is that if somebody who's in any responsible corporate activity, obviously funded by the

1089
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:10,120
 government to some degree, and can make the statement with any degree of credibility that

1090
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:16,200
 we can take ET home, then there's grounds for prosecution, you know, or there's grounds

1091
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,200
 for something.

1092
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:22,800
 It doesn't strike me as a proper assessment, it strikes me as boastfulness, the bravado

1093
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:31,080
 that exists many times with technicians, or politicians, I just don't want to tag technicians.

1094
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:38,700
 Well, obviously what we're studying here has all kinds of implications, and one of the

1095
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:45,220
 implications that was written about in the Air Force physics books that was taught at

1096
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:54,160
 the Air Force Academy said that if these craft really exist, and I've seen them and everyone

1097
01:26:54,160 --> 01:27:01,120
 here has seen them, that much of what we have concerning our laws of physics, our laws of

1098
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,520
 biology and so on, are probably incorrect.

1099
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,400
 So you can see how it would affect the whole civilization if it was released to the public.

1100
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,440
 And I agree with that statement, totally, and that's the reason why I questioned the

1101
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,760
 statement that we can take ET home.

1102
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,920
 Can I give you one more thought?

1103
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:27,580
 Assuming that the UFOs are there, correct, they travel from one planet to the other,

1104
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:33,400
 where they stop for a gas station, what do they do for oil, what do they do for medical,

1105
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,720
 for the people that's there?

1106
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:42,400
 My own personal thing, there's enough people here in the United States or on this planet

1107
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:49,440
 that would not want the rest of the people to know how they could get this free power

1108
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,080
 and the better medical stuff.

1109
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,980
 So some of that's kept aside also.

1110
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:59,280
 The companies or the corporations or whoever's in charge, they're not going to want you to

1111
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:04,840
 know that you can take a toaster and give New York City all the power they want.

1112
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,560
 They don't want you to know that.

1113
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,320
 They're selling their product and they got to keep control of their product.

1114
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:20,560
 They're paying for gas today, almost $5 a gallon.

1115
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:26,160
 Jim, please.

1116
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:31,900
 The man that the world doesn't give enough credit to that started this in the late 1800s

1117
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:40,800
 is Nikola Tesla.

1118
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,600
 He's almost like Forrest Gump.

1119
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:48,520
 He was everywhere, working with Edison and Alexander Graham Bell and Einstein.

1120
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:52,400
 They finally gave him credit for inventing the radio over Marconi.

1121
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,080
 I'm sure they're going to give him credit for television, radar, but we would not have

1122
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,320
 the world we have today without his invention of alternating current, but somebody starts

1123
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:06,840
 needing to educate the kids in college and the world a little better other than that

1124
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:14,160
 very good show on PBS of the man who created lightning and give this man, whoever he was,

1125
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,440
 credit for the world he brought us.

1126
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,880
 Nikola Tesla, start doing some homework on him.

1127
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:30,520
 I would only respond to what you had said, John, that was that I found in my life and

1128
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:37,360
 in my career that there are more conspiracies than people are aware of, but there are less

1129
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:41,040
 conspiracies than people think.

1130
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:45,720
 It sounds like oxymoron, but it is.

1131
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:51,480
 We can, and of course the audience reacted to your statement in that regard.

1132
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,960
 Sure, there's conspiracies.

1133
01:29:53,960 --> 01:30:00,880
 We know it all the time where new technology is bought up by a corporation because it impacts

1134
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:07,700
 and we know that the corporate interest is more interested in maximizing the profits

1135
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:10,400
 from what they already have in place.

1136
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:15,920
 We see this with refineries, they should be shut down, but they're still making money

1137
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,320
 with them and they're not going to build a new one because they got the old one that

1138
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:23,440
 they're making more profit on.

1139
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:30,280
 But you come to the reality, and this is where I come back, something as significant as the

1140
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:37,680
 unknown, the scientific unknown and the lack of rationale we have to understanding fully

1141
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:43,400
 what these ETs are all about, and primarily the propulsion.

1142
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:49,440
 You know, we've seen testimony, it may be thought.

1143
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,440
 I don't know.

1144
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:57,240
 I'm not enough scientist, I defer to my colleague, Congressman Barrett, who's a lot more educated

1145
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,960
 in that area, but he comes up with the same queries.

1146
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:04,360
 I notice our questions are very similar in that regard, but I just want to underscore

1147
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:07,760
 -- Excuse me, with all due respect, the gentleman's

1148
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:08,760
 time has expired.

1149
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,760
 Well, fine.

1150
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,760
 Good.

1151
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,760
 Thank you.

1152
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,720
 We could go to Representative Patrick.

1153
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,760
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1154
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:23,120
 I came to this conference at the invitation of Citizen Hearing to find out more about

1155
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,440
 the world and the universe.

1156
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:29,840
 When I first got the letter inviting me to participate, I did my homework and looked

1157
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:35,560
 at the 1968 report of the Science Committee in the United States House of Representatives,

1158
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:41,720
 read it, was real briefed on it, and thought it was a beginning.

1159
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:46,040
 Did not confirm, but had a lot of evidence that something else is among us.

1160
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:49,120
 So I thought I'd better look earlier and look more into that.

1161
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:55,280
 When my local newspaper decided to publish it, I agreed to participate.

1162
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,760
 It even opened wider from people I did not know and from around this country and out

1163
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,480
 of the country.

1164
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:08,120
 Some cynics, but mostly scientists and intelligent people who, after years of watching the phenomenon

1165
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:12,300
 and participating in it, came to the conclusion that there is something and that we ought

1166
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,400
 to look into it.

1167
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,760
 So I agreed to come.

1168
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:22,480
 When I came in on Monday, now Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and now Friday, from 9 to 5, I heard

1169
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:31,480
 some of the most intelligent, the most scientific, the most universal knowledge on the topic

1170
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,880
 that I didn't know I was going to witness.

1171
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:41,520
 So when I came in here today, and mockery is being made of it, I'm disturbed.

1172
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:47,760
 I think it's unfortunate, yesterday we heard from 12 different countries who have hundreds

1173
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:52,640
 of years of scientific, intelligent information on this subject.

1174
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:59,800
 They mentioned another 12 or 13 that weren't here yesterday but also believe.

1175
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:05,440
 It behooves us as human beings in what is known as the greatest country in the world

1176
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:10,720
 to participate in that discussion, not just to seize or to take, but to participate and

1177
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,840
 find out what it is.

1178
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:17,320
 As a grandmother of six, two sets of twins, I want them to have the kind of world that

1179
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:24,480
 we've enjoyed all my 60 plus years, and to not act like something exists, and then further

1180
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,560
 to act like it's a joke.

1181
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:37,080
 We do a disservice to our ancestors, to God, and to the people of the world.

1182
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:41,480
 So I'm very new with this.

1183
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:46,400
 I served 18 years in Michigan State House and 15 years in this Congress, now here sitting

1184
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,600
 with you, I'm a high school teacher, two children, six grandchildren.

1185
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:55,120
 I want the world and the universe to continue, and if there is something out there, and I'm

1186
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:59,440
 not a scientist, I have a master's degree from the University of Michigan, I'm learning

1187
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:04,160
 it as you would call it, but there's a whole lot we don't know.

1188
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:08,920
 I think it's ignorant of any people not to seek out what we need to know to continue

1189
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,800
 the universe.

1190
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:17,120
 I was convinced before this morning's panel that there probably is something out there,

1191
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:22,480
 and I'm willing to work the rest of my life to see that it, if it is, and how we can enhance

1192
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:26,760
 the universe to see that we all have a better quality of life.

1193
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:30,360
 As an appropriator on the House Committee here, and the first African American woman

1194
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:35,800
 to serve on appropriations in Michigan for 18 years, and 12 of my 14 years here in Congress

1195
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:41,240
 on the Money Committee, this federal budget is almost $4 trillion.

1196
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:45,960
 The defense budget is $700 billion of that.

1197
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,960
 I served on that appropriations bill for many, many years.

1198
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,360
 Much has been said already, that's why I'm giving you this, because I want to bring it

1199
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,080
 back to what I came here for.

1200
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:57,080
 I don't want to leave it with some yellow guy with stuff sticking out of his head.

1201
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,400
 It's way more serious than that.

1202
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,440
 I can't laugh, I haven't laughed at anything in here, because nothing's funny to me.

1203
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,760
 I don't mean today, I mean all week.

1204
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,520
 It's very serious.

1205
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,520
 The world is in peril.

1206
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,960
 Our country is economically, socially, and economically at a disadvantage right now.

1207
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,280
 But we fix that by being partners in what we believe is correct, and what issue you

1208
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:24,320
 pick to work in, and not to put down historical data that's scientifically proven.

1209
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,160
 You may not believe it, but don't work in that era.

1210
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:30,960
 Don't come in here and just castigate those who do.

1211
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,400
 That's what's wrong with our nation, I think, and our country, and our world.

1212
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,600
 We don't work well enough together.

1213
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,720
 If someone doesn't look like we look or think like we think, we think something's wrong

1214
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:46,440
 with them, rather than grabbing it and let's enhance what we already know.

1215
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:50,920
 Jim Coran, that's my editorial, and I think being last I could say that, because you guys

1216
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,320
 have kind of disturbed me this morning.

1217
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:56,320
 I think the citizens' hearing on disclosure is real.

1218
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:01,160
 I thought before today that most of you thought that too, when two or three people can come

1219
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:05,640
 in the room and change a very intelligent subject such as this to something other than

1220
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:10,920
 what it is, that does a disservice to our country and to our world.

1221
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:17,680
 I think Mr. Coran, if I'm pronouncing that right, Coran, you said something about proof.

1222
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,240
 What is the proof?

1223
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:24,480
 We've been sitting here for 10 hours a day and some people half the night discussing

1224
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,060
 the scientific proof that's been revealed.

1225
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:32,460
 You sound very learned in the subject, but I'm not sure, do you believe in UFOs?

1226
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,700
 Is there an extra SAO presence in the world?

1227
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:37,860
 Ought we be more involved in that?

1228
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:50,080
 Well, I've still got three years left to fly, so Ted Koppel once said on his ABC news show,

1229
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:56,000
 which I thought was a very good statement in my opinion, is who's the most wonderful

1230
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:03,600
 and greatest extraterrestrial never seen, and that was God.

1231
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,220
 It's a big universe out there.

1232
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:14,360
 The proof as far as how they're getting here and their craft and that type of thing, this

1233
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,600
 gets deeper than that.

1234
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,720
 I have run into people that probably have the proof you're talking about, but they're

1235
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:24,440
 not going to risk their security clearance or whatever else they're risking, their families

1236
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:28,440
 for one, to make that possible.

1237
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:35,560
 I would say the reason I've stuck in this so long and stuck my neck out so far is not

1238
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:43,600
 just about losing a career, but it's because there are certain things that I've been privy

1239
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:53,080
 to to keep me going, but at this point I can't get into that, and I wish I could.

1240
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:56,860
 You know, we do, and there have been some military men who've come to this table this

1241
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:00,160
 week and paroled to their own.

1242
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:04,480
 There's people out there that have the proof you're looking for, but it's, you know, we're

1243
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:09,640
 talking on a need-to-know basis, very, very high security clearances.

1244
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:10,640
 Absolutely.

1245
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,960
 National security is her and should be.

1246
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,320
 You know, I understand that, and then I was going to say the military people who came

1247
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,640
 before us, and just coincidentally they were all men, but I know that there are many.

1248
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:23,800
 I served for this room, so it seems like a different room than the other four days.

1249
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:29,000
 And I'm not trying to take anything away from the intel field or the military officers that

1250
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,680
 are a bit involved with this.

1251
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:32,960
 They're doing their orders.

1252
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:38,760
 This, from what astronaut Gordon Cooper told me, they started these lies in '47 after Roswell,

1253
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,480
 and Roswell wasn't the first.

1254
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,480
 Okay.

1255
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:42,920
 Let me reclaim my time.

1256
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,920
 Thank you so much.

1257
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:44,920
 Thank you.

1258
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,320
 Just lastly for me.

1259
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:53,360
 Gordon mentioned maybe it was our UFOs, which said to me, and I think it's one of the two

1260
01:38:53,360 --> 01:39:00,000
 of you guys, gentlemen, that it might have been one of our UFOs, which to me says to

1261
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,760
 me, America's UFOs.

1262
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,120
 Does America are producing UFOs to confuse the cosmos or what?

1263
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,120
 One of you said it.

1264
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,280
 I'm not sure if it was you, Major, or I think it was Major.

1265
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,280
 Did you say that?

1266
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,280
 Or it might have been the gentleman.

1267
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:17,880
 I think I said it also is that it could be ours because they've been doing reverse engineering

1268
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:23,280
 for 30, 40 years now, and there's no telling what they've developed.

1269
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,900
 I don't think anybody here is- So there might be an existence that we're

1270
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,900
 creating also out there.

1271
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:33,980
 And I'm not saying that's good or bad, I just want to make sure I was understanding.

1272
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:34,980
 That's what was said.

1273
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:35,980
 That's what I'm saying.

1274
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:41,600
 Because they say out in Area 51 they do have ships that come up from down, so yeah, we

1275
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,280
 probably have them.

1276
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:44,280
 Okay.

1277
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:49,680
 One thing, and I'm going to end on this, that came out in the scientific, intelligent discussions

1278
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:56,400
 and testimony and lectures that we've heard this week is that whatever's out there, extraterrestrial

1279
01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:03,080
 UFOs, and I haven't yet defined the difference, I know some similarities, some differences,

1280
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:07,720
 is way more intelligent than our technology today, can do more.

1281
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:13,240
 The ships, the UFOs speeding up and stopping and turning and all the things that we haven't

1282
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:18,080
 yet mastered that, that doesn't mean that we can't, or that it doesn't exist.

1283
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:23,040
 It just means that we have more work to do, and we have it more to do universally.

1284
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:33,200
 Thank you very much.

1285
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:39,200
 Steve Allen would like to talk to you about, now, you were a pilot, and you've done a lot

1286
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:45,640
 of flying, but the thing you observed, the incident you observed, you were on the ground

1287
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,640
 at the time.

1288
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,640
 Yes, sir.

1289
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,640
 Yes.

1290
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,720
 A whole lot of people in Stephenville saw what you saw.

1291
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,440
 It's obvious from your testimony.

1292
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:55,560
 Yes, close to 200 witnesses.

1293
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:58,480
 There were, was that what was established?

1294
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,480
 I believe so, yes.

1295
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:10,160
 And the F-16s that you say pursued, whatever that object was, was also seen by how many

1296
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:11,160
 people?

1297
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:15,760
 I'm not sure of the number on that one.

1298
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,880
 There was several, though, quite a few.

1299
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:21,400
 Right, okay, and do we have, is there, and I know there were newspaper reports of exactly

1300
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,760
 what you said.

1301
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,000
 Was the radar involved in that one?

1302
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,680
 Yes, radar reports show the F-16s in pursuit.

1303
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:32,840
 Well, they show the F-16s.

1304
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:38,640
 Was radar involved in the object itself, is what I'm asking, at any stage?

1305
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,440
 I don't feel like it was, no, sir.

1306
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:43,200
 It's probably not.

1307
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:51,800
 And okay, that's consistent with what a lot of the people observed, and all, well, let's

1308
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:57,520
 see, now, was radar, Jim, involved in either of the incidents?

1309
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:03,600
 I think one was in '95, the others were earlier, about 10 years earlier, but was radar involved

1310
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,600
 in any of those?

1311
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:12,320
 There was no radar contact, and we had no TCAS warning, the traffic control warning

1312
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,480
 system in the aircraft did not go off.

1313
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:20,960
 And I thought John Callahan had some pretty good information on why radar might not be

1314
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,200
 involved.

1315
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:28,780
 If radar is not involved, does that lead less credence to the idea that there might be an

1316
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:33,960
 extraterrestrial origin then, if radar is involved?

1317
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:39,040
 Well, obviously, we have stealth technology now, where that came from, I'm not going to

1318
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:48,080
 speculate on, but I know they just had a site, it's in the news this week, Airbus Aircraft

1319
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:54,000
 British coming into Glasgow, Scotland, December 2nd, and it just broke in the news yesterday

1320
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:00,420
 or two days ago, and they were at 4,000 feet, and this disc-shaped thing came under them

1321
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:05,680
 with, you know, strange lights and all that, and they never got any warning from their

1322
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,840
 TCAS system or wasn't on radar.

1323
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:09,840
 So this is --

1324
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,160
 And yes, Mr. Fryler, please.

1325
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:18,720
 Richard Haynes is the -- he's the ex-NASA expert on this, and he's -- all his books

1326
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:25,280
 and studies for years are on pilot sightings, and one of the strangest cases was this Melbourne

1327
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:33,880
 episode in 1978 where the pilot on a Cessna 182 disappeared after he was talking on terror

1328
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:38,120
 traffic control about this craft coming down bright light during the day, and they did

1329
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:44,720
 have radar -- somebody got hold of the tapes from Pine Gap, Australia, our space monitoring

1330
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:50,320
 agency down there, showing something coming at him, and then they never found any wreckage.

1331
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,620
 He's never been heard from again.

1332
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:56,160
 But they're -- Richard Haynes is the expert on pilot sightings.

1333
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,160
 Read any of his books.

1334
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:04,080
 If you're wondering about articles from around -- since the '50s, Rob Simone did an excellent

1335
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:08,240
 job on UFOs and the headlines, real reporting on a real phenomena.

1336
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:09,240
 Okay.

1337
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:12,440
 Mr. Callahan, we've been talking about radar.

1338
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:18,080
 You seem to know a lot about radar, probably the -- probably more about radar than any

1339
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,120
 other expert we've heard this week.

1340
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:22,400
 I think -- and that's not just a compliment.

1341
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:28,200
 I think it's a fact from everything I've heard, at least.

1342
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:35,080
 The question I've asked is you gave some -- repeat, just very briefly, why you think radar does

1343
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,720
 not show up in some of these sightings.

1344
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:41,920
 Well, the radar always shows up, but you can't see it.

1345
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:42,920
 That's the problem.

1346
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:43,920
 Oh, okay.

1347
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:48,840
 You've got to remember now if a UFO or even a Russian or some other come into our air

1348
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:56,320
 space without a working transponder, then the computer would recognize that little dot

1349
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,880
 that the radar picks up as nothing.

1350
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:09,240
 And if it was a huge mass of raw radar, our system says it can't be an airplane.

1351
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:10,880
 It must be weather.

1352
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:16,760
 So it puts it on what they call the WIFMU, Weather Fixed Mapping Unit, and it tells the

1353
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:22,120
 computer says I'll put it on the scope as a cloud unless the controller says I don't

1354
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:23,720
 want to see the weather.

1355
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:26,400
 And if that's the case, it shows up.

1356
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:31,560
 Well, I'm glad I asked you this because, at least for my benefit, this has certainly illuminated

1357
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:33,040
 the understanding.

1358
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:37,440
 And so it would not be fair to say if something did -- go ahead.

1359
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:45,920
 A number of military radar operators and FAA radar operators have called me.

1360
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:53,080
 And basically, what they said was that they were told not to tell the pilots that there

1361
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,640
 was a UFO out there.

1362
01:45:54,640 --> 01:46:02,200
 Always deny the fact the UFO exists and turn the aircraft away so there, you know, there's

1363
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:05,600
 no chance of hitting it or whatever.

1364
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,760
 The point is, is that the -- I don't think there's any radar people here, but that's

1365
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,400
 what I've been told.

1366
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:19,040
 Also, they -- I understand there's some way that they program the computer so they're

1367
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:25,040
 less likely to show the UFOs because they're usually moving at very low altitude or very

1368
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:28,720
 high altitude at very high speeds.

1369
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:32,560
 And the tendency for the radar not to pick them up.

1370
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,520
 But if you go back to the raw radar data, you can get it --

1371
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:35,520
 And I see now -- excuse me.

1372
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,520
 I hate to do this.

1373
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:40,440
 I really do because I love what you're -- to give you this information, but my time has

1374
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,440
 expired.

1375
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:44,440
 Oh, it's too bad.

1376
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,440
 I think I'm next.

1377
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,440
 Yes.

1378
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,440
 Oh, excuse me.

1379
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:50,440
 Go ahead, you have, in fact, four minutes.

1380
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:51,440
 Okay.

1381
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:59,000
 Pilot Courant, can you -- you mentioned in your testimony that you had -- you and a group

1382
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:05,160
 had met with a group of representatives on the Hill.

1383
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,160
 Senators and --

1384
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,160
 Right.

1385
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,160
 And this was 20 years ago.

1386
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:14,520
 There were private meetings where I'd met these people on flights and we got talking

1387
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:17,600
 and they invited me to meet them on the subject.

1388
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,680
 They were interested.

1389
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,320
 Some of them are still active.

1390
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:26,000
 Well, so, you know, oh, it was on the airplane.

1391
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,640
 It was not in their office.

1392
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,360
 They invited me into their office after I met them on their flights.

1393
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,800
 Okay, well, if you go in their office, you know, guess what?

1394
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:32,800
 I know.

1395
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:33,800
 It's public.

1396
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:35,240
 They work for everybody out there.

1397
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:39,200
 They don't -- but you don't have to tell who they are.

1398
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:48,400
 But they would be -- if you would let -- if they were as interested as you say, if somebody

1399
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:55,120
 in the paradigm group or this -- the organizers here knew who they were, that might be a first

1400
01:47:55,120 --> 01:48:07,120
 step for us to get this back onto the radar of the Congress to ask for a hearing.

1401
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:10,880
 That's -- I mean, that would be -- you've got to find this -- we've got to find the

1402
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,880
 thread.

1403
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:12,880
 You'd think we'd know.

1404
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,400
 But we don't know the person that's going to be willing to do that.

1405
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:22,440
 But if you -- somebody has expressed interest to you or you could call them maybe directly

1406
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:25,520
 yourself if you were -- would be willing.

1407
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,280
 It would be a start.

1408
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:32,880
 I wish it was that easy, but even you folks the other day said if you were active in Congress

1409
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:37,280
 or Senate at this time, you probably wouldn't ask for a hearing on this.

1410
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:41,080
 Well, I probably would on the science committee because that would be the perfect committee

1411
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:48,400
 for this because it's not a very -- it's not really political and -- but I mean, after

1412
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,360
 this week, I would now that I've got information.

1413
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:56,720
 No, I -- on one of my flights, I asked -- it kind of went the wrong way where I asked the

1414
01:48:56,720 --> 01:49:03,140
 senator -- he was friends with some very well-to-do friends of mine, and they were main campaign

1415
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:04,880
 fundraisers.

1416
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:09,760
 So we got talking, and it was just he and I in the -- out in the waiting area before

1417
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,960
 his flight.

1418
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:15,680
 And I asked him, "Senator, do you think there's a chance of ever having another congressional

1419
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:21,200
 hearing like 1968 with Gerald Ford?"

1420
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,320
 And he said, "No, never.

1421
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:24,520
 It's all been explained away.

1422
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:25,520
 There's no need for that."

1423
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,360
 There's only one of them, but I just thought maybe you'd found somebody that had some interest.

1424
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:30,360
 Can I --

1425
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:31,360
 Oh, there is.

1426
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:32,360
 They're still active, the people there.

1427
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:38,120
 I would like Mr. Callahan to be able to complete his -- you have something you wanted to say.

1428
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,120
 And I want to make --

1429
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:40,120
 Well, I started --

1430
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:41,120
 I have a minute.

1431
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:42,120
 -- the military is in charge of control.

1432
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:48,960
 I started with the FAA when it was known as the CAA before radar when controlled with strips.

1433
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:55,920
 When they brought the first radar unit into the facility, it was an old VG scope that

1434
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,800
 the Navy used to use.

1435
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:03,200
 And the instructions was 26 pages, and nobody knew how to use radar.

1436
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:09,080
 We started off with what they had was just a broadband radar, raw radar.

1437
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:15,000
 And eventually, they were able to draw airways on this VG scope that we're looking at.

1438
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,800
 We had to do all kinds of things when the pilot called on the frequency, and he's approaching

1439
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:24,760
 Harrisonburg, you look down there, and there's like 15 people all in that area.

1440
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:29,160
 So you would tell them to make a right turn, 30 degrees for 30 seconds, then resume your

1441
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:33,200
 navigation, and you would look to see who's turning.

1442
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:38,400
 Sometimes, two or three people would turn, because sometimes the pilots have a real sense

1443
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,400
 of humor.

1444
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:43,120
 And eventually, you give this guy a couple turns, and you'd pick him up and say, "He's

1445
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:44,120
 there."

1446
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,120
 It's a primary target.

1447
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:46,320
 It's only a dash.

1448
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:52,080
 We had all kinds of trouble keeping them separated from one another, because they weren't all

1449
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,600
 flying under the FAA control.

1450
01:50:54,600 --> 01:51:00,320
 They invented the transponder, and they made it mandatory that you have to have a transponder

1451
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,520
 to fly above certain altitudes.

1452
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:07,960
 The transponder now gives a signal so that you'll always see the target.

1453
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:13,160
 But if there's somebody flying alongside of them that doesn't have a transponder, he shows

1454
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:14,160
 up as a dot.

1455
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:16,040
 The dot is always there.

1456
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:21,480
 If it's a UFO, and he's traveling at 3,000, 4,000 miles an hour, when you look at your

1457
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:24,860
 scope, you see him here, okay?

1458
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:27,000
 Ten seconds later, he's over here.

1459
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,800
 He's nowhere near your area that you're controlling traffic on.

1460
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,520
 You get one hit, maybe two.

1461
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:35,640
 He gets one hit on his sector, and it's gone.

1462
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:38,200
 He wouldn't know that was a UFO.

1463
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:42,920
 And as long as I've been in the FAA, and I had worked up to the position where I was,

1464
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:49,920
 the guy in charge of all the air traffic people in the United States, if they screwed up on

1465
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,720
 their phraseology, it was my fault.

1466
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:55,280
 That was the new thing after the strike.

1467
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:58,840
 So I knew everything, and we did everything.

1468
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:03,260
 We never told our controllers not to report a UFO.

1469
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:09,160
 We did tell them not to solicit a near miss report, because when you bring two airplanes

1470
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:13,240
 too close together, they would file what we called a near miss.

1471
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:18,560
 Well they were getting too many near misses, so they said, "Do not ask the pilot if he

1472
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,360
 wants to file a near miss.

1473
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:22,040
 When he gets on the ground, he can do it."

1474
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:30,240
 But that's the only thing we restricted of filing, was a near miss report, not a UFO.

1475
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:33,600
 And I see that our time for this panel has expired.

1476
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,560
 I want to thank the panel.

1477
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,560
 This has been very interesting.

1478
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:41,160
 Thank you.
