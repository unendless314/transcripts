1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
 And we'll begin with the two witnesses that are here.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,140
 If you would be so kind as to repeat after me, I do hereby affirm that I will tell the

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:24,660
 truth and nothing but the truth to the members of this committee today.

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,560
 Thank you both.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,480
 And we're going to begin with Dr. Greer.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,480
 Thank you.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,160
 It's an honor to be here.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,040
 And I would just like to summarize this subject by saying that I got involved in 1990 when

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,800
 I formed the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and put together some of the early

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,640
 briefings for folks in the administration of President Clinton.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,440
 This occurred because in 1992 I was leading a team of people where we had a contact event

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,040
 on a beach in Florida.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,040
 And this got reported into a Department of Defense memo or report that was done by John

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,040
 Peterson at the Arlington Institute.

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,560
 And he was friends with the man who became CI Director Woolsey.

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,680
 CI Director Woolsey invited us to come to Washington to meet with him and some folks

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,040
 to discuss this.

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,720
 And it was to my great surprise and dismay to learn that the CI Director had made inquiries

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,460
 into this subject and had not gotten any information.

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:40,640
 This was also true of President Clinton who, through Webster Hubbell, had also made inquiries.

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,440
 Because of this, we decided to put together an initiative which was called Project Starlight

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,840
 and it was very much involved in the early days with briefing senior people in the military

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
 and government.

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,980
 And to my dismay, I have to say at this point that we discovered that there was an extra

25
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,960
 constitutional management of this subject, which continues to this moment, which I find,

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,480
 as Eisenhower said, an existential threat to our democracy.

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,920
 It's for that reason, a few years ago I left my medical career to pursue this and to get

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,160
 the truth out to the public because I feel it's a matter of very pressing concern.

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,960
 I'm an emergency doctor and I always kind of halfway jokingly say I know an emergency

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,360
 when I see one and our planet and our government is in an emergency.

31
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,740
 During the period around the time we had our meetings with Mr. Rockefeller, I had already

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:48,680
 set up briefings through the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Kramer,

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,240
 meeting at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to which the remains of the Roswell event

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,800
 was sent.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,560
 They initially did not want to have this meeting.

36
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,800
 It was ordered by the head of Air Force intelligence under the orders of J2, which as you know

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,020
 is head of intelligence, joint staff, Admiral Kramer.

38
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:14,760
 That then led to a series of events where we decided what we needed to do was pull together

39
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,280
 the best military, intelligence, and corporate, Lockheed, Northrop, and other witnesses as

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,200
 we call them, to this issue and begin to do briefings for various members of Congress

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,360
 and people in the administration.

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:39,440
 In 1995, I organized, and Mr. Rockefeller funded, a gathering of the first of witnesses

43
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,420
 at Isilomar near Monterey in California.

44
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,400
 These were people, they were cosmonauts, they were from Russia, they were astronauts such

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,020
 as Edgar Mitchell, they were people who had worked with Eisenhower and knew of Eisenhower's

46
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:01,840
 concern that he had lost control over the secrecy on this issue around 1956.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,240
 Then ironically, the Rockefeller commission reorganized the Department of Defense and

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,060
 the CIA into such a Byzantine mess that to this day these projects have not had proper

49
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,880
 oversight at that level.

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,900
 This then led to us doing some meetings for members of Congress.

51
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,520
 We did in 1997, and Congressman Dan Burton, who was chairman of the House Government Oversight

52
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,980
 Committee came, along with a number of other congressmen and senators, and also following

53
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,080
 that, we did what's called a stand-up briefing, Edgar Mitchell and I did, the Sixth Man to

54
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,640
 Walk on the Moon, with some of our military sources for then head of intelligence joint

55
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,240
 staff, Admiral Tom Wilson.

56
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,280
 To my astonishment, when I had this meeting, I had sent in advance a briefing similar to

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,320
 the one that I provided here, this is the one I provided for President Obama.

58
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,520
 What I was astonished and appalled to learn is that the first document that I have in

59
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,120
 this document is a National Reconnaissance Office document that has actionable intelligence

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,680
 listing project code names and code numbers, effective as of the early '90s.

61
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,640
 This Admiral, Tom Wilson, looked through this document, identified one of the compartments,

62
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,680
 contacted them and was told, and I'm quoting, "Sir, you do not have a need to know."

63
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,040
 This is the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he said to the person,

64
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,880
 it was a contractor, I cannot disclose which one, he said that basically, "Sir, we will

65
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,600
 not discuss this with you further," and basically hung up on the Admiral.

66
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,200
 Because of that event, we then wrote a unless otherwise directed letter.

67
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,920
 My military advisor said, "Dr. Greer, what you need to do is do a UNOD letter that goes

68
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,160
 to all branches of government that says that we have concluded that this subject is being

69
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,480
 managed in an extra-constitutional fashion.

70
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,880
 A priori, the National Security Act no longer applies to those under those, and they are

71
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,640
 hereby exonerated or freed from them."

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,880
 We wrote such a letter to the heads of all agencies.

73
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,640
 It was never contested, and the way unless otherwise directed letter works is that unless

74
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,800
 you hear back from the agency, you are allowed to proceed with your assessment, and our assessment

75
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,800
 was that we were going to go forward with these men and women and documents.

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,440
 In fact, there was a senior CIA official who I have been asked not to name who is still

77
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,080
 in the science directorate of the CIA who said, "Please do this for our nation."

78
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,040
 At that point, we began to gather together more of these so-called witnesses.

79
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
 They've been called now.

80
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,360
 I call them patriots who want to have the truth out.

81
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,480
 We then did the 2001 disclosure project in this ballroom, and we're about at our 12-year

82
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,960
 anniversary of that, and I organized that for the purpose of getting the public informed

83
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,600
 and also Congress.

84
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,360
 There were tens of thousands of petitions sent to members of Congress in faxes asking

85
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
 for hearings.

86
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,480
 Unfortunately, a few months later, 9/11 happened.

87
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:25,400
 The day before 9/11, September 10th, that there was a memo from a comment, I should

88
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:33,040
 say, in a speech by then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld who stated that there is $2.3 trillion

89
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,520
 unaccounted for in the Department of Defense budget.

90
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,080
 Let me repeat that number, $2.3 trillion.

91
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,880
 This was on September 10th, 2001.

92
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,440
 Now, prior to that, I was not surprised at that comment because back in 1994, I had a

93
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,040
 meeting with Mr. DeMato, not the senator, who was the chief counsel for the Senate Appropriations

94
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,400
 Committee, and he informed me that they felt that there was upwards of or in excess of

95
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,040
 $900 billion a year missing out of the Treasury going into so-called black projects.

96
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,760
 Now, this is a misnomer, just so that the committee knows, the proper term in the military

97
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,120
 and intelligence world is an unacknowledged special access project.

98
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,400
 Now, special access projects are projects that, of course, you have to be read into

99
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,480
 with various clearances.

100
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,240
 The unacknowledged ones are ones for which there is no acknowledgment on paper, and anyone

101
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,080
 in the project is ordered not to speak about it under threat of termination with extreme

102
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,080
 prejudice, which is death.

103
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,960
 My senior military advisor was in one such project.

104
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,680
 He has not even informed me what it concerned.

105
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,480
 It was under Admiral Harry Train.

106
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,580
 It was a $3 billion project.

107
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,160
 This is one project that was unacknowledged.

108
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,480
 So this is not a theory.

109
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,800
 This is how the deep national security state actually operates that the members of Congress

110
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,960
 usually are not aware of.

111
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,640
 Now, in the ensuing year, since 2001, we have continued these briefings.

112
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,400
 We've had greater success in other countries.

113
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,920
 There are now more than 14 countries that have opened their UFO files.

114
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,680
 We've been very instrumental in this.

115
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,800
 I've worked with people at the Vatican, the French government, and what is also very exciting

116
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,320
 is that one of the most important documents in history, which I'll provide to the committee,

117
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:41,560
 is a document from the Ministry of Defense of France committing to my organization to

118
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:49,040
 engage in a long-term project to make peaceful contact with these "visitors."

119
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,600
 This document has not been yet released.

120
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,040
 I will provide it to the committee, and there is great progress being made in other countries.

121
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,200
 Admiral Moran, who won the Ampere Prize in France and is an MD, as I am, and also a PhD

122
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,800
 physicist, and has been an advisor and was an advisor to President Sarkozy and others,

123
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,640
 has been meeting with us and we have been involved with projects in other countries

124
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
 to do this.

125
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,840
 I will tell you, however, that as they began to step into this, they were warned off by

126
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,560
 someone within the national security state saying, "Do not pursue this."

127
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,200
 We went to France about two years, three years ago, and we had an expedition to actually

128
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,640
 make contact with these extraterrestrial civilizations.

129
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,720
 The admiral later informed us that their radar tracked objects that came over the site at

130
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
 between 100,000 and 200,000 kilometers an hour.

131
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,520
 Now, what is fascinating about this is that the French were not deterred from doing this

132
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,800
 project with us, but they have to date remained fairly quiet.

133
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,480
 There is, therefore, progress being made in other G7 countries.

134
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,800
 As you know, we have a former Minister of Defense of Canada here who is very supportive,

135
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,280
 the Honorable Paul Hellyer, and what we find, however, is that the United States has remained

136
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,920
 a black hole of secrecy.

137
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,200
 Now, the reason for this is complex.

138
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,280
 One of the reasons is inertia.

139
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,160
 Once you go into an unacknowledged special access project, it's very hard to bring things

140
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
 out.

141
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:34,000
 Number two is that this is the crown jewel in America of the defense industry and the

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 aerospace industry.

143
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,240
 My uncle was a senior project engineer at Grumman that became North of Grumman that

144
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,280
 put the first man on the moon with the lunar module.

145
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,560
 He worked on the lunar module, which is part of how I got involved with this.

146
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,200
 What I have found through my uncle and other contacts at Lockheed is that we have had since

147
00:11:52,200 --> 00:12:01,240
 about the mid-1950s operational electromagnetic-gravitic devices, basically in parlance of the pop culture

148
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,560
 anti-gravity devices, that are deeply classified and are the next generation beyond rockets

149
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,340
 and jet aircraft.

150
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,200
 These are fully operational and not experimental.

151
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,400
 These have been used very discreetly.

152
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,160
 We have an enormous amount of information on this, including a facility, Norton Air

153
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,320
 Force Base, where we had Frank Carlucci, the Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan, was

154
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,480
 ushered in there, and some people who were with him, such as Brad Sorensen, have given

155
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,800
 us information and actually have helped us provide schematics and drawings for these

156
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,480
 so-called alien reproduction vehicles, a bit of a misnomer because in reality advanced

157
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,200
 anti-gravity research began with T. Townsend Brown in 1929.

158
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,480
 We will get more into this on Friday.

159
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,160
 The key point here is that the technologies that would give us a new civilization without

160
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,520
 oil, without gas, without coal, without nuclear power are extant.

161
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,820
 They already exist, they've been developed, and it is a matter of the utmost national

162
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:18,960
 security and world peace and justice that we bring these sciences out and start a new

163
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,640
 chapter in the human experience.

164
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,160
 Thank you.

165
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,040
 Daniel.

166
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:40,800
 I'd like to address the issue from the point of view of a practicing attorney in these

167
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 particular areas.

168
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:50,120
 I just touched on it briefly earlier in the other panel that when I was at the Cahill

169
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:58,040
 Gordon law firm in New York, we were brought the Pentagon Papers at that time, and Jim

170
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,400
 Goodell, the chief counsel for the New York Times contacted us.

171
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,160
 I had been working on the briefs for the New York Times because I happened to have initiated

172
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,280
 the case that established the right of journalists to protect their confidential news sources

173
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,800
 when I was at the Harvard Civil Rights Law Review.

174
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,560
 So I was at the firm and was working on the briefs, and Jim Goodell brought us the information

175
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,360
 that they had the Pentagon Papers, and so it was the first time that I found myself

176
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,440
 in a situation where I had to kind of try to put myself in the shoes of people that

177
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,560
 I had the luxury prior to that time of just saying, "We ought to get it all out.

178
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,800
 We ought to just reveal everything.

179
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,760
 We ought to tell all the people have a right to know everything."

180
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,560
 And I found myself in this peculiar situation of starting to ask questions about what might

181
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,120
 be in there that we had to try to be careful about revealing.

182
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,160
 Now in that particular case, it wasn't a hard question because we found things about the

183
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,180
 assassination program of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Phoenix program.

184
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,040
 We found out that they were smuggling opium in Southeast Asia to help fund it.

185
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,320
 We found out about the Nugent Hand Bank that was set up by Theodore Shackley, who was the

186
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,280
 CIA station chief in Saigon.

187
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,160
 All the things that we found out about in that particular instance I felt were criminal

188
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,920
 conduct, unlawful conduct.

189
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:26,120
 And it had occurred because the Central Intelligence Agency, when it was created in 1947, was out

190
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:32,000
 of Section 5412, the 5412 committee was set up inside the National Security Council to

191
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,360
 actually oversee covert operations.

192
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,040
 For the first time, it actually legitimized the undertaking of covert operations that

193
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,760
 were not going to be revealed to the Congress.

194
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,760
 It was before we had an intelligence committee.

195
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,160
 You remember that Prescott Bush, the United States Senator from Connecticut, was the one

196
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,080
 who would brief in certain Congress people and certain senators about this.

197
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:02,960
 So there was this entire kind of extra constitutional process or protocols that began to be undertaken

198
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,240
 right at the very beginning.

199
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,200
 Finally, they set up the 5412 committee inside the National Security Council that oversaw

200
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,920
 those things.

201
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:17,680
 And as I said, I had never had access to that until we saw the Pentagon Papers, and on reviewing

202
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,260
 it with Neil Sheehan and the others, I came to the conclusion that all of this should

203
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,920
 be revealed, that these were criminal activities that had happened that were all happening

204
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,400
 outside of the United States, but they were having such dramatic effects inside the United

205
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,660
 States that I thought they ought to be talked about.

206
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,480
 But that was my first experience with this.

207
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,440
 As it proceeded, I ended up becoming chief counsel in the Karen Silkwood case, the woman

208
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,440
 that was killed out in Oklahoma at the nuclear site out there.

209
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:56,480
 And during our investigations of that, we discovered that 98 pounds of bomb-grade plutonium

210
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,440
 were being smuggled out of the Kermage nuclear facility, the reprocessing plant, and we discovered

211
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,080
 that it was actually being transported secretly to Israel.

212
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,240
 So I touched on that old third rail.

213
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,240
 There it was, and we went and we briefed Peter Stockton.

214
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,800
 He was the chief investigator for John Dingell.

215
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,480
 John Dingell was chairing the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, and because

216
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,680
 of the oversight of authority they had over nuclear facilities environmentally, we briefed

217
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,320
 them and told them all about this, and they actually set up a -- they tasked a real-time

218
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:42,480
 national security agency satellite to actually monitor the smuggling of these materials and

219
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,000
 actually track them onto being put on charter oil company ships and then boarded by Mossad

220
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,420
 and brought to Israel, and at that time they were under the condition that they had to

221
00:17:53,420 --> 00:18:00,120
 share some of the special nuclear materials, 98 percent pure bomb-grade plutonium, that

222
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,760
 they had to share them with the Shah of Iran.

223
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,140
 So that they actually were providing 98 percent pure bomb-grade plutonium, reprocessed plutonium

224
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,600
 to the Shah of Iran and to South Africa, the Afrikaner government.

225
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,320
 Now because of my discovery of that, it was a clear absolute blatant violation of the

226
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,800
 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and so I briefed the judge.

227
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,120
 We had the Judge Tice, Frank G. Tice, was the chief counsel -- was the judge on that

228
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
 case.

229
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:38,360
 I provided a memorandum to him, an affidavit to him explaining the whole thing, and the

230
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,160
 following Monday he contacted me and said the Central Intelligence Agency had contacted

231
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,960
 him and wanted to have an in-camera ex parte meeting with him, and he met with them and

232
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,160
 immediately dismissed one of the counts in our case, in the Karen Silkwood case, the

233
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,520
 whole -- her death on the highway.

234
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,560
 The whole interfering with her right to travel on the highway, her First Amendment right

235
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,580
 to meet with the New York Times, because David Burnham was waiting for her at the Holiday

236
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:11,480
 Inn to receive the documents showing that these -- it was 40 pounds, 98 percent pure

237
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,400
 platinum grade plutonium was missing.

238
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:22,720
 And when we gave that information to the congressman, nobody ever talked about it after that.

239
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,960
 They called Stan Turner in, they brought him downstairs, put him under oath, challenged

240
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,400
 him about this, and the only reason I knew about it was because Peter Stockton told us

241
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,960
 about it.

242
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,800
 So it became obvious again to me at that point that there were secrets that virtually everybody

243
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,520
 agreed within the political circles had to be kept secret, and this supplying -- our

244
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,920
 supplying in complete violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, 98 percent bomb grade

245
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,080
 plutonium to Israel was one of those things.

246
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,600
 And so I realized that at that time there were these -- there was this dimension, such

247
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,500
 as Dr. Greer has talked about, there are levels of classification that are way beyond people

248
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,980
 in the congress, way beyond us as civilians, but I spent a lot of time looking into this

249
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,440
 whole process.

250
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,680
 And as you know, I was the one that filed the original Iran-Contra case that got the

251
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,160
 special prosecutor appointed.

252
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,080
 We uncovered all the smuggling of the weapons that were going on, the cocaine smuggling

253
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,040
 operations that were going on.

254
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,920
 It became clear to me that everybody knew about this, that all kinds of people knew

255
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,280
 about this going on, but the citizens didn't.

256
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,880
 And as I tried to bring information to some people in congress and the senate, et cetera,

257
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,980
 talked with Tip O'Neill about all of this, and we -- as I discovered all this stuff was

258
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:46,240
 going on, I was then later contacted by Dr. John Mack, as I told you, to represent him,

259
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,680
 and I was aware of the fact that there was this realm of ultimate secrecy that existed.

260
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:59,360
 But I realized that there was a classification above everything that I'd ever seen that was

261
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,900
 cosmic, a cosmic top secret.

262
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:10,000
 There's a whole category of cosmic top secret that has to do with this particular category,

263
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,240
 and that there's information in there about contacts with these beings that were recovered

264
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,840
 from Roswell, a living being, one particular living being that they brought to Wright-Patterson,

265
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,240
 that they didn't know what to do with the being, they didn't know how to take care of

266
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,840
 the being, they had to keep the being isolated, but they were afraid of potential contamination.

267
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:39,840
 And I was challenged at that point to try to determine whether or not I would reveal

268
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,360
 these things to everyone.

269
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,880
 I kept trying to have contact with people inside the intelligence community to say look,

270
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,680
 if there's something that you think I ought to know that would convince me that the American

271
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,840
 people somehow shouldn't know about this, tell me about it, will you?

272
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,600
 Because if you're not going to tell me about it, I can tell you I'm going after it, and

273
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,480
 I'm going to be going after it in a context that may make it automatically available to

274
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,520
 anybody once I get it.

275
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,560
 And only a couple of times have I ever approached and said to stay away from these things.

276
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,160
 Well that's not an answer, just to stay away from it.

277
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:21,040
 And so what I've done is I'm just coming to you today to tell you that with my experience

278
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,960
 directly as one of the attorneys in the Pentagon Papers case, I was in F. Lee Bailey's office

279
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,640
 when we did the Watergate burglary.

280
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,680
 It was our office that got McCord to write the letter to Judge Sirica, blowing the whistle

281
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,800
 on the Watergate plumbers, the Karen Silkwood case with the smuggling of the plutonium,

282
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,360
 the Ron Contra case with all of the smuggling of cocaine that was going on.

283
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,540
 But nothing matches this issue.

284
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,200
 Nothing comes close to matching this issue.

285
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:58,240
 Because the reality of it is, is that because whatever this extraterrestrial intelligence

286
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:07,080
 is, they obviously share the belief that somehow we shouldn't be just told right straight outright.

287
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,780
 As people have said, why don't they land on the White House lawn and just tell us?

288
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,840
 So there is obviously some type of consensus that exists at the highest levels of the security,

289
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,280
 cosmic, top-secret clearance in our government.

290
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,320
 And when I asked Gorbachev about this, because I was legal counsel to the State of the World

291
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,840
 Forum for Gorbachev and Senator Baker at the end of the Cold War, he told me flat out that

292
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,120
 these things existed and that they'd known that these existed and they were in communication

293
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,520
 with the United States government about this.

294
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:44,800
 So what I'm saying is that we need to as citizens be insistent upon finding out about this unless

295
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:51,340
 and until somebody communicates information to us that makes sense as to why it is that

296
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,040
 people all shouldn't know about this.

297
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,880
 And they haven't told me that yet, and so until they do, I'm going to continue to try

298
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,080
 to find out everything I can about it and share it with people who've had the kind of

299
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,300
 responsible positions that you have had in your lives and still have in your lives.

300
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:13,600
 Because the reality is you still have political capital, whether you're 87 years old or 39

301
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,640
 years old or whatever your ages are now, that you still have political capital that can

302
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,160
 effectuate a change and that for you to go collectively to sit down with certain members

303
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,640
 of Congress or certain people together to say, "Look, this is what we know and we want

304
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,100
 to act responsibly.

305
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,900
 Can you please help us act responsibly, but we're going to act in any event?"

306
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:48,560
 And that's how you will find out, I believe.

307
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,600
 Mr. Cameron.

308
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,480
 As I explained this morning, my name is Grant Cameron.

309
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,920
 I'm a private investigator for 38 years.

310
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,260
 I've spent most of my time looking at what the highest levels of U.S. government, military

311
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,080
 and intelligence agencies know about the UFO phenomena.

312
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,780
 This afternoon, I'm speaking about the Rockefeller Initiative.

313
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:17,280
 My testimony is based on 1,000 pages of documents that were released to me in 2001 by the Clinton

314
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,520
 White House in response to an FOIAA for UFO files.

315
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,480
 It should be noted here that, like the documents you were talking about this morning, the Roswell

316
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,660
 documents that disappeared, these documents have now disappeared.

317
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,600
 Both the National Archives and the Clinton Library both maintain they do not have the

318
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,440
 documents.

319
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,160
 For example, I filed an FOIAA with the Clinton Library.

320
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,080
 I received about 1,000 pages of UFO documents, which included an awful lot of material that

321
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,320
 Stephen Greer had said to the President.

322
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,780
 The 1,000 pages that I'm going to talk about right now were not part of the disclosure,

323
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,880
 and both maintain that they don't have them.

324
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,720
 They are on my website, the President's UFO website, and basically what the documents

325
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,200
 show, these FOIAA documents show that billionaire businessman Lawrence Rockefeller had approached

326
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,560
 the White House to get the government to disclose the truth behind the UFO mystery.

327
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
 There was different Rockefellers.

328
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,840
 There was Nelson Rockefeller, who was the political guy who ran for government.

329
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,240
 There was David, who was the money guy, and Lawrence Rockefeller was this sort of humanitarian,

330
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,680
 had a philosophy degree from Princeton, and was very interested in this phenomena.

331
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,560
 Rockefeller also had other meetings outside the White House.

332
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,400
 One example was with Republican Stephen Horn, Republican from California, from the Government

333
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,360
 Reform and Oversight Committee related to government secrecy.

334
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,200
 Rockefeller's request for UFO disclosure was dealt with in the White House by the President's

335
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,820
 science advisor, Dr. Jack Gibbons.

336
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,640
 To prepare for the first meeting in March of 1993 with Rockefeller, Dr. Gibbons requested

337
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,700
 a UFO briefing from the CIA.

338
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,280
 That briefing was tasked at the CIA to Dr. Ronald Pandolfi.

339
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,800
 So if you want to know, that's probably the guy you should be phoning.

340
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,640
 Dr. Ronald Pandolfi, who's been identified by the New York Times as the top scientist

341
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,080
 in the CIA, and a man who is rumored inside the UFO community as the agency expert on

342
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,820
 UFOs, and a man that over the last 20 years has repeatedly interacted with many researchers

343
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,340
 inside the UFO community.

344
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:32,040
 As the CIA has a public position of no UFO involvement, Pandolfi gave the job of writing

345
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,520
 the White House briefing, which he knew would become public because Lawrence Rockefeller

346
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,680
 was involved.

347
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,800
 He gave that briefing job to a private UFO researcher, Mr. Bruce McAbee, who had done

348
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,040
 a couple of UFO lunchtime talks at the CIA headquarters.

349
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,800
 The briefing therefore became not an official briefing on the subject, but just a personal

350
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,240
 opinion of one researcher inside the UFO community.

351
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,920
 Rockefeller exerted great pressure on the Clinton White House, threatening to write

352
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,320
 an open letter demanding UFO disclosure from President Clinton, and to make this demand

353
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,060
 public in full-page ads in all the major newspapers in the United States.

354
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,280
 Under this pressure, Dr. Gibbons agreed to try to get some sort of disclosure on the

355
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,620
 UFO subject.

356
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,200
 He asked Mr. Rockefeller to pick one case that could be declassified, and then all the

357
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,760
 rest of the cover-up material could be dealt with.

358
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,360
 Mr. Rockefeller picked the 1947 UFO crash at Roswell as the case to investigate.

359
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,660
 And that is one of the reasons why there was a reinvestigation of the Roswell crash by

360
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,320
 the U.S. Air Force in 1994.

361
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,560
 The U.S. Air Force did not decide to do it on their own.

362
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,560
 At the same time, the White House was green-lighting a reinvestigation of Roswell.

363
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,840
 The Government Accountability Office was also doing a reinvestigation of the Roswell crash.

364
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:01,000
 That investigation was initiated by New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff, who ordered the

365
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,080
 GAO investigation after his requests for information were stonewalled by Clinton's first Secretary

366
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,680
 of Defense, Les Aspin.

367
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:20,560
 The G.O.A. study, however, was quite limited; only FOIA replies on the Roswell crash were

368
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
 used.

369
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,360
 Nothing was found except that a bunch of key Roswell documents from the time of the crash

370
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,200
 that would have indicated what had happened were missing.

371
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,640
 Therefore, no conclusion was offered.

372
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,320
 The U.S. Air Force reinvestigation discovered a way to bypass the actual reinvestigation

373
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,800
 of the crash, rather than following the testimony of many of the witnesses that will be appearing

374
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,600
 here this week.

375
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,800
 They simply published a final report stating that the whole 1947 crash event had been caused

376
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:57,720
 by the launch of a mogul balloon designed to monitor a possible Soviet nuclear test.

377
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:04,600
 In 1995, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, President Clinton challenged the official U.S. Air Force

378
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,560
 Roswell report, which had no discussion of the reported alien bodies.

379
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,680
 In a speech that he gave, he stated, "As far as I know, an alien spacecraft did not crash

380
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:23,280
 in Roswell, New Mexico, but if the United States Air Force did recover alien bodies,

381
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,280
 they didn't tell me about it either, and I want to know."

382
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,680
 This open challenge in Northern Ireland forced the U.S. Air Force to do a second Roswell

383
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
 crash report.

384
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,800
 The U.S. Air Force released this report to a room of laughing reporters as they described

385
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:46,800
 how six-foot tall wooden dummies dressed in Air Force uniforms in 1953 somehow explained

386
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,600
 what people had described as small four-foot gray creatures in 1947, including one alien

387
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,240
 that was still alive.

388
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,800
 The report was the Air Force's lame attempt intended to answer Clinton's challenge about

389
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,840
 the alien bodies mentioned in Belfast.

390
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,560
 Without any official record of the event, Lawrence Rockefeller did sit down with Bill

391
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,960
 and Hillary Clinton, and most of those documents were provided by Stephen Greer, who provided

392
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,920
 them to Lawrence Rockefeller.

393
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,240
 They met at the Wyoming JY Ranch, which was controlled by the Rockefellers.

394
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,920
 Rockefeller briefed both Bill and Hillary Clinton on the best available evidence for

395
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:34,520
 UFOs and for the need to make that information available to the American people.

396
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:41,560
 The mention of Hillary's name in the 1995 briefing at the Rockefeller Ranch is important

397
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,840
 because the Rockefeller Initiative documents that I recovered show that Hillary played

398
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,080
 a key role in the Rockefeller White House initiative on UFOs.

399
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,160
 There are two key documents.

400
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:03,160
 In November 1, 1995, there's a letter from Rockefeller's lawyer to the president's science

401
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:10,160
 advisor, and in that it points out that Hillary and her staff have been helping Lawrence Rockefeller

402
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,880
 edit a letter of UFO disclosure to the president.

403
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,840
 The letter was called "Lifting Secrecy of Information about Extraterrestrial Intelligence

404
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,160
 as Part of the Current Classification Review."

405
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,200
 What was happening was Lawrence was sending this document to various people, and he would

406
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,560
 threaten to send the letter to the president if he didn't get cooperation, and various

407
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,520
 people helped him edit the letter.

408
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,480
 Hillary was one of the people who helped edit this letter on UFO disclosure.

409
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,520
 In a second 1996 letter from Rockefeller to the president's science advisor, in the letter

410
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,600
 he clearly spells out the information that is coming from Rockefeller to the science

411
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:55,800
 advisor to President Clinton, and from President Clinton's science advisor to Rockefeller,

412
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:01,480
 all that material is going through Hillary Clinton's First Lady's office.

413
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,520
 In 2006, the initiative faded out after the briefing at the ranch, and Rockefeller moved

414
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,960
 on to fund other UFO research activities.

415
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,960
 1996, pardon me.

416
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,400
 If you just apologize, I have a meeting at the Justice Department, like at 3 o'clock,

417
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,040
 and I'll be gone until 5 and I'll be back.

418
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,720
 I apologize, but I have to go, okay?

419
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
 You've all been there.

420
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
 I think.

421
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
 We get it.

422
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
 Thank you.

423
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
 Thank you.

424
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
 Thank you.

425
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
 See you later.

426
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:47,480
 Okay, well I will be repeating obviously some of the material that has been covered by some

427
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,480
 of the other panelists, but this is my prepared statement.

428
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,960
 Throughout most of the 1990s, a significant amount of UFO-related research was funded

429
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,720
 by the billionaire philanthropist Lawrence S. Rockefeller.

430
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,520
 Yet with a few exceptions, this was mostly unknown by the general public, the media,

431
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,520
 and even the majority of the ufological community.

432
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,480
 It was also ignored by the mainstream world, who chose to ignore the unconventional side

433
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,560
 of one of the Rockefellers.

434
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,880
 His long official biography posted online by the Rockefeller Archive Center doesn't

435
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:29,240
 mention any of his UFO, paranormal, new age, and consciousness-oriented interests, and

436
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,440
 neither did the long obituaries published by the New York Times, the Washington Post,

437
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:41,000
 and other mainstream publications when he died in 2004 at the age of 94.

438
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,600
 And yet, these activities were not small in consequential part of the philanthropist's

439
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
 life.

440
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,720
 He seemed to have spent quite a bit of time thinking, meeting people, and funding research

441
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,160
 in the period going from the late 1980s to 2000.

442
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,600
 Without access to his financial records, there's no way of knowing how much money he spent,

443
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,640
 but it must be around a few million dollars at the least.

444
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,040
 Although I never met him personally, I know something about it because I had the opportunity

445
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,200
 of working firsthand in one of Lawrence Rockefeller's sponsored projects, the UFO briefing document,

446
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,000
 The Best Available Evidence, a special report published in December 1995 sent to the White

447
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,160
 House, selected members of Congress, and VIPs, which is now available for free at the OpenMinds.tv

448
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
 website.

449
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,560
 First activities, in fact, went beyond funding into actual lobbying at the highest level.

450
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,120
 President Bill Clinton and the First Lady and current secretary, well, no longer current

451
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,000
 secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

452
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,480
 Long before the term exopolitics was in vogue, Lawrence Rockefeller was practicing it in

453
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,760
 the White House from 1993 to 1996.

454
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,000
 This has come to be known as the Rockefeller UFO Initiative, a multi-pronged campaign to

455
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,160
 get the U.S. government to release sensitive information on UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence.

456
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,680
 The initiative is documented in hundreds of pages of correspondence, released a few years

457
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,080
 ago by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, or STP, under the Freedom

458
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,960
 of Information Act.

459
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,160
 These documents can be accessed at the Paradigm Research Group website, and also, of course,

460
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,000
 Grant Cameron has obtained lots of additional documents.

461
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,260
 I'm enclosing a long article describing all the various facets of the so-called Lawrence

462
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,600
 Rockefeller UFO Initiative, published in the Open Minds magazine, number 6, February, March

463
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,280
 2011.

464
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,280
 It is not necessary to go into the biographical background of Mr. Rockefeller in this short

465
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,560
 presentation, except to note that he was one of the original grandsons of the founder of

466
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,920
 the dynasty, John D. Rockefeller, that he was obviously extremely wealthy and well-connected,

467
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,240
 that he had studied philosophy at Princeton and was quite a visionary even in business,

468
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,980
 where he seemed to be always ahead of the curve, backing aeronautics in the '30s, electronics

469
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,920
 in the '60s, and conservation and environmental efforts throughout his long career.

470
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,840
 Although the mainstream media chose to ignore it, his intense interest in UFOs and ET issues

471
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,560
 in the '90s fits very well with this pattern.

472
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,560
 Mr. Rockefeller backed many UFO-related projects in the period between the late '80s and 2000,

473
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,520
 but for the purpose of this hearing, we will concentrate on his political initiatives in

474
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,080
 these areas.

475
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,560
 Lawrence Rockefeller's first forays in topology started sometime in the late '80s through

476
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:52,120
 Dr. Cecil B. Scott-Jones, a parapsychologist and former U.S. Navy commander who had worked

477
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:58,080
 as naval attache in Asia and at the Naval Scientific and Technical Intelligence Center.

478
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:04,840
 Between 1985 and 1991, Jones was special assistant to Senator Claiborne Pell, the powerful Rhode

479
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:10,080
 Island Democrat chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who was deeply interested

480
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,400
 in parapsychology and who probably many of you met personally.

481
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,240
 Senator Pell was also friends with Lawrence Rockefeller and both served on the board of

482
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,440
 the Human Potential Foundation, a small think tank launched in 1989 in Vienna, Virginia

483
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:34,280
 by Jones to conduct "research into all conditions of humankind, physiological, psychological,

484
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
 and spiritual."

485
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,160
 Many of the papers released by the White House OSTP come from Scott-Jones, who knew Dr. John

486
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,280
 Gibbons, a physicist who worked for many years as director of the Office of Technology Assessment

487
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,840
 for the U.S. Congress and was appointed in 1993 by the Clinton administration to direct

488
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,800
 the OSTP.

489
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,560
 What was the exact turning point of Lawrence Rockefeller's evolution from a general interest

490
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,000
 in consciousness studies into the specific area of UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence

491
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,340
 is still unclear, but the end of the Cold War and the arrival in Washington of a younger

492
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,140
 generation represented by Bill and Hillary Clinton are key factors.

493
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,320
 He felt the time was ripe for a new and fresh approach into an area that had been previously

494
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,720
 dominated by a Cold War mentality.

495
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,320
 Rockefeller recruited for these efforts a longtime associate, Henry L. Diamond, an environmental

496
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,520
 attorney from Washington, D.C., whose links to the family went all the way back to the

497
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,920
 1960s when he worked with Lawrence in his conservation activities.

498
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,760
 Diamond also knew John Gibbons, and so he was the right person to make the first contact

499
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:53,480
 with the OSTP chief when he sent a memorandum on March 29, 1993, requesting a meeting, and

500
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,000
 I'm quoting now the first paragraph.

501
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,400
 Lawrence S. Rockefeller, who is a leading U.S. conservationist, businessman, and philanthropist,

502
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,420
 is anxious to have a brief meeting with Dr. Gibbons to discuss the potential availability

503
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:13,200
 of government information about unidentified flying objects and extraterrestrial life.

504
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,240
 As one who has had a longtime interest in environmental and spiritual issues, Mr. Rockefeller,

505
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,360
 with other leading citizens, is planning to make an approach to President Clinton on this

506
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,360
 subject.

507
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:32,040
 The details of Rockefeller's White House lobbying effort are described in my article and also

508
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,680
 in the documents themselves posted by PRG.

509
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,120
 We know from the record that following the initial meeting with Gibbons and subsequent

510
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,420
 correspondence, the government decided to constrict the more general issue of UFOs into

511
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,600
 the specific and famous UFO crash of July 1947 in Roswell, New Mexico.

512
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,960
 This incident will be discussed in detail at a later session during this hearing.

513
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,000
 After ignoring it for decades, the Air Force had then taken the decision to finally make

514
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,520
 a big public statement, which took place in 1994 with its official report that explained

515
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,120
 or debunked the incident as a one-stop secret balloon project to detect the Soviets' first

516
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,040
 atomic bomb test codenamed Project Mogul.

517
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,760
 This derailed to a great extent the initial Rockefeller effort at the White House, but

518
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,040
 didn't stop him to try a different approach.

519
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:34,900
 By 1995, Lawrence Rockefeller switched his UFO-related coordinator from Scott Jones to

520
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:40,480
 Marie Goldbreath, the well-connected wife of investment banker Evan Goldbreath, who

521
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,540
 was ambassador to France during the Reagan administration, Republican candidate for New

522
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:52,600
 York governor in 1994, and chairman of William Buckley's National Review, among other things.

523
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,960
 Marie Goldbreath and Sandra S. Wright, another well-connected high society lady who run the

524
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,220
 BSW Foundation, had come up with the idea of preparing a comprehensive UFO briefing

525
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:08,200
 document that could be sent to members of Congress and VIPs in general.

526
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,640
 The original draft was written by Don Berliner, an aviation journalist and long-time ufologist

527
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,040
 with the Fund for UFO Research, FUFOR, in the Washington area, and I was brought in

528
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,320
 to help edit and expand the document from a small office ran by Marie Goldbreath in

529
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,520
 New York's Madison Avenue.

530
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,340
 The final briefing document was finished in December 1995, but sent out in early 1996.

531
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,560
 It was Rockefeller's and Goldbreath's idea to give the copyright to the UFO Research

532
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,320
 Coalition, a consortium of the three main American UFO organizations, MUFON, that is

533
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:51,440
 the Neutral UFO Network, CUFOS, Center for UFO Studies, and FUFOR, the Fund for UFO Research,

534
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,160
 whose directors endorsed the document.

535
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,900
 Copies of the report were sent to Dr. Gibbons at the White House, some members of Congress

536
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:05,800
 and VIPs worldwide, but there was no well-connected effort to disseminate the document, and as

537
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,800
 a result, its political impact was limited.

538
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,680
 The one exception was France, due to Marie Goldbreath's extensive connections there from

539
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,400
 her U.S. Embassy days back in the 1980s.

540
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,840
 Copies of the UFO briefing document were sent from President Chirac down the food chain

541
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,820
 in the French government.

542
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,720
 We had received, in fact, many interesting documents and reports from the official French

543
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,960
 UFO group at the National Center for Space Studies, CNS, the French equivalent to NASA,

544
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,920
 then called CEPRA, and now J-PAN.

545
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,640
 And one of the briefings' case histories was the famous UFO landing case in Transant

546
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,480
 Provence in 1981.

547
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,060
 I will have more to say about the French official UFO investigation at a later session in this

548
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,360
 hearing.

549
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,400
 There can be little doubt that the UFO briefing document became the model for the Cometa report,

550
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,920
 an important study conducted by a group of retired French generals and intelligence officers

551
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,040
 led by Major General Denis Letti.

552
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:18,440
 In their final 1999 report titled "UFOs and Defense, What Should We Prepare For?"

553
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,960
 the Cometa authors praised highly, quote, "the leading U.S. personality, Marie Goldbreath,

554
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,520
 who was supported both morally and financially by Lawrence Rockefeller."

555
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,600
 That's from the Cometa report.

556
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,480
 Marie Goldbreath was also the coordinator for a number of separate UFO-related projects

557
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,760
 funded by the philanthropists.

558
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,700
 By 1997, Lawrence Rockefeller dropped the political UFO initiatives and concentrated

559
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,160
 instead on the scientific angle.

560
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,480
 A major meeting, close to both the public and the press, was held from September 29

561
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,840
 to October 3, 1997, at the Pocantico Conference Center in Taritone, New York.

562
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:05,000
 The chief coordinator and author of the final report was Dr. Peter A. Sturrock, an astrophysicist

563
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,480
 from Stanford University who also directed for many years the Society for Scientific

564
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,280
 Exploration, SSE.

565
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,160
 The idea was to gather a group of professional scientists, many of them from Europe, and

566
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:25,360
 have scientifically trained UFO researchers present the best evidence to a panel of neutral

567
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,360
 scientists.

568
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:32,200
 The presentations touched upon all the main scientific areas, photographic evidence, luminosity

569
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,280
 estimates, radar evidence, the Hess-Dowling Project.

570
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,440
 This is a place in Norway where unexplained lights have been recorded for many years.

571
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,840
 Vehicle interference, aircraft equipment malfunction, apparent gravitational and/or inertial effects,

572
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:58,640
 ground traces, injuries to vegetation, physiological effects on witnesses, and analysis of debris.

573
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,720
 You can consult Professor Sturrock's final report on the scientific conference, the UFO

574
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,000
 Enigma, a new review of the physical evidence.

575
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,920
 It was published by Warner Books in 1999, and it's also available on the SSE's website,

576
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,680
 the complete report, for all the details and data.

577
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:22,200
 Rockefeller seemed very satisfied with the results of this event, and he even wrote the

578
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,760
 books forward, which became his only statement on UFOs written for publication.

579
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,400
 By 2000, Lawrence Rockefeller reached the age of 90 and was concentrated on his private

580
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,080
 family affairs.

581
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,600
 For all practical purposes, the Rockefeller UFO initiative and funding, whether scientific,

582
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,640
 political, or philosophical, was over.

583
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,920
 But his contribution to the field was certainly extensive.

584
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,920
 We hope that other philanthropists will follow in his path and try to solve the mystery of

585
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,280
 UFOs.

586
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,520
 Both the political and scientific approaches are valid and necessary in order to understand

587
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,520
 the complex ramifications of this phenomenon.

588
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
 Thank you.

589
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,520
 Thank you.

590
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:14,320
 I believe we're a little over time, so how much time will each panelist get?

591
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,320
 Six minutes.

592
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:23,520
 All right, and I will follow in the footsteps of my co-chair and waive my turn till the

593
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,520
 end.

594
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,440
 So Mr. Bartlett.

595
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,440
 Thank you very much.

596
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,560
 Dr. Greer, you mentioned that there was a very large amount of money that could not

597
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,640
 be accounted for in the Pentagon.

598
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,360
 The Pentagon still cannot be audited.

599
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,360
 They hope that they may have books in several years in the future that could be audited.

600
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,360
 They will not be.

601
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,920
 It's hard to believe that in today's world that, and you know, they spend about half

602
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:59,720
 of all the money we vote to spend in the Congress, and we don't spend 1% of our time in the Congress

603
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,720
 talking about this expenditure.

604
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,760
 There's a day or so, once a year, when we debate this on the floor and pass this bill,

605
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,720
 and this spends about half of all the money that we vote to spend.

606
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,280
 It's just incredible to me that it's been this long and they still do not have books

607
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,000
 that can be audited.

608
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,320
 You mentioned anti-gravity devices.

609
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,800
 I'd like to know a little bit more about that.

610
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:33,120
 I know that this is one of the things that Stephen Hawking is trying to harmonize, relativity,

611
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,680
 gravity and so forth.

612
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:41,040
 Many people believe that he may be the best mind in a millennium, the Britisher who...

613
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,040
 Yeah, right.

614
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,880
 Well, I think that actually there are two tracks in physics.

615
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,680
 There's the track you'd find at MIT and there's the track you'd find at the Naval Research

616
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,680
 Labs.

617
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,160
 There's the third highest ranking scientist there, and some other folks, as well as some

618
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,800
 physicists down near the Redstone Arsenal and the Marshall Space Flight Center.

619
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:08,160
 I can assure you that they have used very high voltage systems at low input of power,

620
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:16,920
 meaning low total energy consumption, to create what's called a pointy vector into space.

621
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,840
 This is tapping what's called the zero point energy field, the renowned defense journalist

622
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:28,440
 Nick Cook wrote a book about this called The Hunt for Zero Point.

623
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:34,180
 Without getting too much into the physics of this, I will just say that studies on this

624
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:40,120
 matter began actually in the 1920s with T. Townsend Brown, who later became key to the

625
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,320
 Rand Corporation.

626
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,840
 But also, I should point out that in Germany, the Koloski-Frost experiment, which we'll

627
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:52,560
 go into on Friday, using crystalline structures, and now we're using nano-crystalline materials

628
00:49:52,560 --> 00:50:01,240
 like you find in transformers to create a electromagnetic field, if you will, around

629
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,560
 an object that gives it lift.

630
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,400
 And there are classified aspects of some of our known aircraft, and I talked to Admiral

631
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,440
 Wilson about this, such as the B-2 Stealth, that involved this.

632
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:17,320
 But the ones that look like they're circular, so-called flying saucers, there have been

633
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:24,520
 prototypes of this for a number of years, and about October 1954, from sources I have

634
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:30,160
 who have been in what's called the Vault at the National Security Agency and other facilities,

635
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,640
 we really figured out gravity control, which means that we can do lifter systems, such

636
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,560
 as the ones that people report in UFOs.

637
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:43,520
 I'd like to reserve enough time to ask you about something else that you mentioned that

638
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,440
 really concerns me.

639
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:56,040
 Mr. Sheehan mentioned necessary secrets, things that we keep from the American people.

640
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,520
 I really am conflicted in this area.

641
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,920
 I will acknowledge that you may argue that there are necessary secrets, that there are

642
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,560
 black projects, you didn't characterize them that way, but some of these top, top secret

643
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,920
 things that you're talking about, above top secret, it's a black world, I've had several

644
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:19,160
 briefings and a special skiff on black projects.

645
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,680
 If you can do this, then for the good of the American people, you can ignore the Constitution

646
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,680
 to do good things.

647
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,040
 And we do that.

648
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,280
 We do ignore the Constitution to do good things.

649
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,880
 We're ignoring the Constitution to do all of the welfare we do, because it's not an

650
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,960
 Article I, there's not an enumerated power.

651
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,320
 We're ignoring the Constitution to do all of the healthcare that we do.

652
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,880
 We're ignoring the Constitution to do all of the education that we do, because none

653
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,600
 of those three things, where we spend a huge amount of money, are specific enumerated powers

654
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,680
 in Article I, Section 8, and both the Ninth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment, pretty

655
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,600
 clearly say if you can't find it there, you can't do it.

656
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:07,440
 Now my conflict is that whereas I recognize that there may be necessary secrets, if you

657
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,320
 extrapolate from this, then you can ignore the Constitution to do good things.

658
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,720
 If today you ignore the Constitution to do good things, tomorrow you can ignore the Constitution

659
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,720
 to do bad things.

660
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,680
 Well, I think that's where we are today, and I think this is what Dwight Eisenhower, President

661
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,480
 Eisenhower said in his last address when he said, "Beware the military-industrial complex."

662
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,320
 And if I might say so, I think that the withholding from the public of this information is not

663
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:39,400
 only a crime against humanity, it is actually causing us to stay on a petrodollar system

664
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,800
 that is destroying the environment.

665
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,040
 I think most people miss the reason.

666
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:49,560
 My meeting with the CIA Director Wolsey, the only thing he wanted to know is, "Why won't

667
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,960
 they tell me about this?"

668
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,520
 And the same thing with Lord Hill Norton, the Minister of Defense of Great Britain,

669
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,000
 and I said, "Sir, the reason they don't is that you're good folk, and you would not go

670
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,640
 along with criminal secrecy, illegal secrecy, that is withholding science and technologies

671
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,520
 that would give us a civilization without oil."

672
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,080
 Now, but that's a multi-trillion dollar problem, and I think we've reached the point where

673
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,520
 the tail is wagging the dog.

674
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:19,520
 The special interest and the influence from corrupting, I'm going to use the word, corrupting

675
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:26,960
 influences within the national security state ties right straight into the macroeconomic

676
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,400
 order and the petrodollar system.

677
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,520
 The secrecy isn't because people are going to hurl themselves off the bridge into the

678
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,040
 Potomac River because we're not alone in the universe.

679
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,600
 Sixty-five percent of the public believe there's intelligent life out there.

680
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,880
 Over half the public believe we've been visited.

681
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,160
 Forty-three percent believe they're here and visiting us currently, and these are in recent

682
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
 polls.

683
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,840
 The bigger issue is, why would we be keeping this secret?

684
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,680
 There is a document that I have from the Federation of American Scientists released two years

685
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:01,720
 ago that there are 5,135 patents that have been seized under the National Security Act.

686
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:09,600
 Dr. Greer, we have to end your response, and it is Senator Gravel.

687
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:17,600
 I won't take my full time because some of these questions need to be elaborated like

688
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:25,080
 Dr. Greer was doing, but let me add, because of our view that we want to get the Congress

689
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:31,040
 to do something, there's a ruling of the Supreme Court, and my colleague will be interested

690
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,960
 in about the constitutionality of it.

691
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:40,480
 I was prosecuted by the Nixon administration, and my defense, which Danny Sheen is very

692
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,520
 knowledgeable about, was the speech and debate clause of the constitution.

693
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,280
 I released the Pentagon Papers as a sitting United States Senator.

694
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,520
 That ruling was finally rendered in 1972.

695
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:00,200
 It was a 9-4 that still left me exposed because I published the papers outside of the Senate

696
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,560
 in addition to releasing them in the Senate, but it was a unanimous decision that I had

697
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:15,080
 the right to reveal any secret that I had knowledge of to the public and could not be

698
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,920
 questioned in any other domain of the government.

699
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:25,160
 That is the law of the land since 1972, and it hasn't been changed.

700
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,800
 No, there's the law, and there's the law that's sanctified by the Supreme Court decision,

701
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:36,120
 and so this element of the constitution is rock solid, and yet, when we turn to the Congress,

702
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:42,040
 oh, why don't they ... First, they're being lied to, but what little information you get

703
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:50,160
 like the various committees on secrecy and defense, I mean, they have bodies of knowledge

704
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,800
 that they should just as a matter of course release to the American people, and that would

705
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:04,080
 begin to alter this paradigm that we accept as a nation that we can be lied to by our

706
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:09,080
 politicians wantonly, and nothing is ever done about it.

707
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:14,880
 That's one comment I wanted to add, and I want to add to him also, he was saying it,

708
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,680
 but I want to say it more clearly.

709
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,440
 The Defense Department has never been auditable.

710
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,720
 You can't audit it, and it's wishful thinking that you think that they'll ever get to

711
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,760
 that because it's convenient to not audit what's going on.

712
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:35,880
 The other is I want to add to Sheehan's comments, which of course was I'm sure a revelation

713
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:42,800
 to a lot of people, that here in Israel, we shipped this nuclear capability to Israel,

714
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,000
 and one of their tasks was to share it with the Shah.

715
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,960
 Well, the adding to that is we gave the Shah an experimental nuclear reactor, which is

716
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:00,240
 in Tehran today, and the plan for that reactor was to be able to build bombs that would be

717
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,400
 under the control of the Shah or under the control of the United States.

718
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,600
 What had happened after the revolution, and this is what most Americans don't know right

719
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:14,680
 now, is that it was the Ayatollah Khomeini who made the decision that that reactor would

720
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:20,660
 not be used for any nuclear devices, bomb-making devices.

721
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:25,960
 It was an internal decision by the supreme, the imam, that they would not do that because

722
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,960
 the Quran did not sanction weapons of mass destruction.

723
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,400
 And now when you get the take by American media that, "Oh my God, they're searching

724
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,820
 for the bomb."

725
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:40,880
 We tried to give them the bomb under the Shah, and they're the ones that decided they don't

726
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,880
 want it.

727
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
 It's immoral.

728
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,880
 I just wanted to add that.

729
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,600
 Those are the two points that I wanted to make.

730
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,480
 I'll yield back the balance of my time because I can't think of an intelligent question I

731
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,520
 could ask to the intelligent testimony we just had.

732
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,280
 That's nice.

733
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,280
 Congresswoman Kilpatrick.

734
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,780
 Thank you very much, and again, thank you for your testimony.

735
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,880
 You're absolutely right, Senator.

736
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,760
 I think today's whole experience has been one of intelligence, higher than we're normal

737
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,480
 in our society.

738
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,960
 Maybe this room itself and our subject matter may have something to do with that, but we

739
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,960
 appreciate your service.

740
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,120
 Thank you.

741
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:31,720
 Going back to the millions of dollars that are missing, or inaudible, or missing, in

742
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:38,240
 the defensive budget over several years, 2.3, Dr. Greer, I think was the number you gave,

743
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,320
 2.3 trillion, 2.3 trillion, and that's over several years.

744
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,680
 I know most of you know at the table that we have also passed an intelligence budget

745
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,240
 in the Congress.

746
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,960
 All intelligence matters are funded in that budget, and as members of Congress, we don't

747
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,240
 debate it.

748
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:00,080
 We don't know its bottom number or any of that because, quote, it's over our classified.

749
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,280
 Members of Congress are also classified to a point.

750
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:09,460
 When we come in office, as you know, I'm sure we take an oath and sign for the intelligence

751
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,000
 level that we can hear.

752
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,080
 Of course, there's super, super intelligence that we don't, and I think we're discussing

753
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,960
 much of that today, which is where the money is and where that intelligence budget is gone.

754
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,440
 You mentioned emergency and everything we talked about today, and my newspaper person

755
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,120
 came up to me this ... I told them I'll speak to them on Friday after I learn more, but

756
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,120
 they still keep coming.

757
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,480
 I don't usually speak unless I know something.

758
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,640
 I'm trying to learn, so I don't have much to say.

759
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,640
 You mentioned that it's emergency.

760
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,640
 It's emergency now.

761
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,380
 Several other speakers this morning mentioned that they're here.

762
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,240
 They're not the only ones here, and that God is the universe.

763
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,960
 I just believe there's got to be a whole lot of other things that we don't yet know, and

764
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,960
 will soon, hopefully.

765
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,240
 Is there an emergency?

766
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,840
 What happens if we do nothing?

767
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,840
 What ought we do?

768
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,080
 How should we do it?

769
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:59,720
 Well, I think that there's a wonderful Chinese saying, "Unless we change directions, we're

770
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,360
 likely to end up where we're going."

771
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,780
 The point is, if you look at the trend lines of where our civilization's going, the intractable

772
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,320
 mess we have in the Middle East, and of course, when we say national security interests in

773
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:15,200
 the Middle East, it means oil.

774
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,840
 As pointed out, Israel has about 200 or 300 thermonuclear weapons.

775
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,320
 They can take care of themselves.

776
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,180
 Why are we still on oil?

777
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:30,000
 I think we're on oil, and coal, and nuclear power, because there has been an active longitude

778
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,080
 and a long-term suppression of really advanced sciences and technologies.

779
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:42,040
 I think that this has created both a geopolitical emergency and a geophysical emergency.

780
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:46,480
 Whether you believe in global warming or not, you cannot have seven billion people burning

781
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,480
 oil, and gas, and coal indefinitely.

782
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,480
 What are going to be the solutions?

783
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,040
 Now, my farm in Virginia runs on solar.

784
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,440
 Luckily, I was, I guess, affluent enough to put in a huge solar farm.

785
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:03,380
 It's the biggest private solar farm in Virginia, but it's not practical for most people, whereas

786
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:07,560
 there are advanced technologies dealing with the physics of zero-point energy, so that

787
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:13,440
 every home and car would have a generator pulling energy out of the fabric of space-time,

788
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,960
 and you would never have to burn another drop of oil.

789
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,960
 Why are we not there?

790
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,120
 Why are we not doing that?

791
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:22,320
 Because there has been active suppression of this information.

792
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:27,960
 As Mr. Sheehan reported, there are people on my team who have been threatened.

793
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,320
 There is a man working on one of these devices for my group.

794
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:37,840
 We provided some grant funding, and about two or three years ago, a former CIA director,

795
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,600
 who I don't want to talk about, with a group of people went down there and threatened him

796
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,960
 and his wife if he didn't stop.

797
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:49,280
 So this is a man who is attached to IT&T and does contract work for the CIA.

798
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,400
 He had been clear to do it for us.

799
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,400
 Why then?

800
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,400
 Wait, doctor.

801
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,520
 If people have been, what was that word?

802
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,520
 He was threatened.

803
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,520
 Threatened.

804
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,520
 Yeah.

805
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,960
 Threatened, near-death, exercise, eliminated, or whatever that means.

806
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,960
 Right.

807
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,000
 Why then are we talking to you today, and how are you so healthy today?

808
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,400
 Any of them is threatening you, or are you just strong?

809
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,400
 I'm strong.

810
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
 Right.

811
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,760
 And we have a lot of good friends, and there are folks.

812
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,760
 People mentioned Dr. Ron Pandolfi at the CIA, and I did spend a lot of time with Lawrence

813
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,760
 Rockefeller.

814
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,680
 There are a lot of people who have supported what we're trying to do.

815
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,120
 There are a lot of people who are opposed to what we're trying to do.

816
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,400
 There is a committee, it used to be called Majestic, that deals with this issue.

817
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:36,440
 And I will give the committee a document, this document I refer to, and the second one

818
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:42,360
 down is Cosmic Ops, and the third one is Magic Ops and Magi Ops.

819
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,360
 You know how important that would be if we had it in front of us?

820
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,360
 Which is my point.

821
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,680
 We're going to get it for you.

822
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,680
 We need all of it.

823
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,680
 Yeah.

824
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
 We need your testimony.

825
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,680
 It helps us prepare.

826
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,080
 And when you refer to things, we can see it as well as hear it, and it's internalized

827
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,080
 better.

828
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,080
 I appreciate it.

829
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,800
 And we have a computer disk we'll give each of you that has all of this.

830
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,600
 What's key about the document, however, is that these compartmented operations that are

831
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:09,760
 known to exist work mainly in the science and technology area.

832
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,480
 And this particular document is from the National Reconnaissance Office, and it was a security

833
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,640
 breach warning for Nellis Air Force Base.

834
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,600
 And of course, we would only need things that we can see legally, you know, whichever classifications

835
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
 we are.

836
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,320
 You may have something that you cannot share, and that's okay, too.

837
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,320
 Well, no, I don't.

838
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:30,680
 Actually, everything that we have, even if -- we have determined, as I said through the

839
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:35,800
 unless otherwise directed order that we sent out a letter, that all of this information

840
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,800
 is declassified.

841
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,800
 All right.

842
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:42,600
 Because we have determined that the secrecy has been maintained outside a proper constitutional

843
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:47,560
 -- look, I met personally with the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency for a very

844
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,020
 long period of time.

845
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:54,640
 He was given information, actionable intelligence, and he, along -- as well as Admiral Wilson,

846
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,040
 and this man is General Patrick Hughes, and many of you may have known him.

847
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,640
 He was denied access.

848
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,900
 That has got to be illegal.

849
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:05,200
 You cannot be denying senior people who are in the chain of command.

850
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
 And so --

851
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,200
 Okay.

852
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,200
 You have to stop there, because my minute is up.

853
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,200
 Yeah.

854
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,200
 Yeah.

855
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,200
 But just thank you for that.

856
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,200
 Thank you.

857
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,200
 And we want to work with you.

858
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,200
 We want the information --

859
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,200
 Thank you.

860
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,200
 -- in writing, as well as verbally, and I yield back the balance of my time.

861
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,200
 Thank you.

862
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,200
 Yes.

863
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,200
 You'll get all of this.

864
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,200
 This is all for you.

865
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,200
 Thank you very much.

866
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,200
 [Applause.]

867
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,960
 Congressman Cook.

868
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,960
 Yes.

869
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,480
 I'd like to continue with Dr. Greer for a moment.

870
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:40,160
 You talked about 14 countries that have opened up UFO files, and I take it that these are

871
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,640
 probably similar to files that the United States has that the United States government

872
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,000
 has refused to open up.

873
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,640
 Am I right in that implication?

874
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,640
 To clarify, those are the documents that would be available within those governments that

875
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,720
 are not in an unacknowledged special access project.

876
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,640
 Great Britain, for example, has recently opened up a large number of files, but those are

877
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:06,440
 the ones that can be obtained by a FOIA-type officer, same thing in France.

878
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,960
 There are corollaries to these unacknowledged projects in some of these other countries,

879
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,800
 which we have discovered -- Great Britain, certainly, Canada, certainly, and also France.

880
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,960
 But I think that what we have to understand is that they have at least been making the

881
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,240
 attempt to show interest and support for bringing out this information.

882
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,440
 I think in South America, we've even seen more support, with some governments having

883
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:35,880
 offices in their ministries of defense, investigating this and releasing information almost in real

884
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,880
 time.

885
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,760
 So I think we're seeing more disclosure in some of these other countries.

886
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,200
 The United States has been the most recalcitrant.

887
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:52,200
 You've indicated, as we've just talked about, the $2.3 trillion that you said is completely

888
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:57,240
 missing from the Department of Defense budget over, what, a couple decades?

889
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,560
 Well, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld didn't comment on how long.

890
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:05,480
 Now, Secretary of Defense Cohen -- I think most of you may have known him during the

891
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,880
 Clinton years -- he was given information also from Gordon Cooper, one of our witnesses

892
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,320
 who was an astronaut, and he also said, "Look, I've looked into this, and there's a great

893
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:20,080
 deal of activity, but they won't share it with me," from the secretary of defense.

894
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:24,040
 So yeah, but that $2.3 trillion, we don't know quite where it's going.

895
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:29,760
 Okay, but when you say that we don't know quite where it's going, is it part of that

896
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:36,320
 or all of that or some of that, the unacknowledged special access processes that you talk about?

897
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,320
 Projects yet, USABs.

898
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,320
 Projects.

899
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,320
 Unacknowledged special access projects.

900
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,320
 Projects.

901
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,840
 Those, yes, by definition, if the secretary of defense keeps tracking --

902
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,100
 So a lot of that $2.3 trillion is those?

903
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:52,840
 Over several decades, and we estimate it's between, at this point, $100 billion and $200

904
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,840
 billion a year.

905
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,840
 Okay.

906
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,840
 That would give us universal health care, by the way.

907
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,520
 And I'm not defending any of this part, but look --

908
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,860
 [applause]

909
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:08,920
 I'm not defending this aspect of it, but if $2.3 trillion is, in fact, the unacknowledged

910
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,600
 special access project, is that what you're saying?

911
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,400
 Apparently, if the secretary of defense --

912
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,880
 Well, that's not really -- oh, you're saying it could be.

913
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,880
 You just don't know.

914
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:21,160
 We think it is, and in fact, I believe that's what he was saying over a number of years,

915
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,160
 many years.

916
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:31,240
 If we have counted in those projects things like anti-gravity machines, things like space

917
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:37,920
 elevators that are based on anti-gravity research and magnetism and electricity that goes far

918
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:44,100
 beyond any of us are really totally aware of right now, or some may be, or I can think

919
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:48,200
 of a number of things, but here's my question.

920
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,200
 Yes.

921
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:57,380
 And I want you to really give me your best possible feeling on this.

922
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:01,760
 Is some of that clearly, legitimately, withheld for national security reasons?

923
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,760
 Yes.

924
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,680
 In fact, I was approached by some folks after Obama was elected to support an initiative

925
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:16,280
 to privately bring out the lifter or electromagnetic gravitics, and I said because they could become

926
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,760
 a delivery system, and I was meeting with an Air Force colonel at the time, I think

927
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,680
 that some of that needs to be looked at very carefully.

928
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:28,240
 However, the stationary energy generation systems that would get us off oil, gas, and

929
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,160
 coal tomorrow, those should be brought out.

930
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,160
 So I think that --

931
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,160
 Of course.

932
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:37,360
 So I think you do have to have a very -- and I'm saying this, and I know there are people

933
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,880
 who probably in the disclosure movement are going to be appalled by what I'm about to

934
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:47,480
 say -- is that we do not yet live in a world where everyone on the planet should have a

935
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:52,600
 lifter and transfer transportation system that could get us from here to Paris in two

936
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:58,760
 or three minutes, and I think that those sort of technologies obviously have weapons delivery

937
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,760
 applications.

938
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:06,760
 However, the part of the technology that deals with energy generation should come out and

939
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:12,720
 has also been suppressed for reasons mainly of macroeconomic stability, because as you

940
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:18,240
 know, part of the national security discussion has always been these would be highly disruptive

941
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,360
 technologies, to which I say, well, good, you want to be disrupted now or later when

942
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,800
 we go through a terminus with the environment melting down around us.

943
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,560
 We have got to make these hard decisions.

944
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:34,480
 Okay, well, then my last question to you, Dr. Crere, would be these 14 countries that

945
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:40,240
 are disclosing, or at least making it possible for the people in those countries and people

946
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:46,400
 around the world to know what's in those files, is it possible that one of the reasons they

947
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:52,240
 may be motivated over the United States is because they think some of this stuff that's

948
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:58,920
 being seen and this phenomena, the maneuvering that's been talked about, the maneuvering

949
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:04,080
 that defies the laws of physics, might be something the United States is testing, that

950
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,200
 the United States just refuses to talk about?

951
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,200
 Correct.

952
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,960
 They do know that that's the case, and in fact, yes.

953
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,800
 In fact, in the French government, we've had discussions about this.

954
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,760
 They know that some of these objects have extraterrestrial origin.

955
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,440
 They know that some of them are man-made, and the Lockheed Skunk Works and some of my

956
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:26,000
 witnesses and sources work in the famous Skunk Works, and I will tell you that Ben Rich,

957
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,720
 who headed up the Lockheed Skunk Works, said before he died, and we have a witness to this

958
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:34,760
 comment that we "already have the technologies to take ET home."

959
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:42,280
 In other words, we already have at the Skunk Works interstellar-capable technologies.

960
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,280
 Thank you.

961
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:53,360
 Thank you, Ms. Scherer.

962
01:10:53,360 --> 01:11:00,320
 Thank you, first of all, for your testimony, it's been incredibly interesting.

963
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:10,040
 When you have other countries opening up, is there any reason that we shouldn't do the

964
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,720
 same, at least to the extent that they're doing?

965
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:17,920
 We talked about, or you talked about some restrictions at places that we might not want

966
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,840
 to go for actually really good reasons.

967
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:28,160
 Is there any reason that we shouldn't open up as much as some of the other countries

968
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,160
 have done?

969
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:36,800
 No, there's not, and in fact, I think that in reality, the secrecy undermines our democracy,

970
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,020
 and my mom's family were some of the original founders of the United States.

971
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:45,020
 They were the first, well, we say the losers, who got caught by the British and were thrown

972
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:50,800
 in prison, so we were the first POWs, and my family and many of us, and my uncle who

973
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,740
 worked at Northrop Grumman, are appalled at the illegality of the secrecy and the ruthlessness

974
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:00,560
 with which it's been enforced, and those of us who've gone through that buzzsaw, and

975
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:06,640
 I've gone through a fair amount of it, it is not pretty, and what I would say is that

976
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:12,140
 this really does undermine our whole concept of a free society.

977
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:15,600
 It also undermines the credibility of government.

978
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,480
 This was one of my key points that I made to Mr. Rockefeller and to the Clinton administration,

979
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,320
 is that when you have almost 60 percent of the public believing this is real and some

980
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:27,640
 part of the government's hiding it, it makes a laughing stock when the Air Force has trotted

981
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,280
 out to say everything's a weather balloon.

982
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,760
 It's just as ridiculous, so the more we can release, the better, and I think the technology

983
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:41,200
 end of it needs to at least be released at the level where we would be able to have practical

984
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:46,880
 applications and sort of a peace dividend and an environmental dividend to this $2.3

985
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:54,000
 trillion that are unaccounted for in the Department of Defense, and that certainly ought to happen.

986
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
 [Applause]

987
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:04,560
 >> I, too, was appalled when I sat on the Budget Committee and found out that the Defense

988
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:12,440
 Department was the only department that can't get through an audit, and the point I used

989
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:18,680
 to push with the Budget Committee was, "Well, let's get started someplace."

990
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:27,520
 I mean, take a department, take a segment of a department, anything to begin to understand

991
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,040
 how the military spends its budget.

992
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:36,880
 Do you think that, with what they do and much of the secrecy they work under, whether it's

993
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,680
 legitimate or not, do you think that's ever possible?

994
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:43,440
 >> Well, I think, you know, we would have to make a concerted effort, and I have to

995
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:51,400
 tell you, the look of fear, and I'm being very honest here, the fear and the anger I

996
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:58,200
 saw in the faces of General Patrick Hughes and Admiral Wilson when we provided the information

997
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,360
 that I'm going to provide for you, and which was provided to these people, as well as C.I.

998
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,360
 Director Woolsey.

999
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:10,040
 It was palpable, because they realized that there was this very deep secret national security

1000
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:15,000
 state that even they, who are supposed to be looking out after our best interests, were

1001
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,580
 being denied access to, and when I asked the Admiral, Admiral Wilson, the head of intelligence

1002
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:26,360
 joint staff, to please try to get control of this, he looked at me, he says, "My understanding

1003
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,820
 now is that the best thing I have is a B2 stealth.

1004
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:33,840
 What this secret organization has are things that can do circles around it.

1005
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,740
 I'm outgunned."

1006
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:42,120
 He also said that until the civilian leaders of the government order him to do something,

1007
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:46,400
 the Secretary of Defense and the President, he can only do so much, but we couldn't get

1008
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:52,800
 President Clinton to lean into this for reasons, well, I don't know if I want to even go into

1009
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,960
 that, but it's for security reasons, safety reasons.

1010
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:03,640
 So I think that this is the sort of problem you run into, and General Patrick Hughes went

1011
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:09,040
 over to a shelf, now this is the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, huge, and he

1012
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:14,480
 said, "This is all I've ever gotten from the Defense Intelligence Agency chain of command

1013
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:20,220
 in my inquiries into this subject," and he had a little ET doll brought at a toy store,

1014
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,680
 and we all laughed but wanted to cry.

1015
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:30,440
 So here you have a general and an admiral and a CIA director, and these people were

1016
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:35,000
 not just picking my brain trying to figure out what I knew, they honestly were being

1017
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,080
 denied access.

1018
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,120
 How can this be?

1019
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,120
 How can it be?

1020
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:47,180
 Well, that's what I found in the hearing when I asked about how do we get to that place

1021
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:49,520
 where they can go through an audit.

1022
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,960
 It was, I mean, it was sort of a big joke, like, "Well, we're never going to be able

1023
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,040
 to do that," so there.

1024
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:02,560
 One of the reasons is this, and this is going to have to get reformed somehow, I know an

1025
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,120
 auditor for my uncle's old company, Northrop Grumman, he said, "Basically, if you're dealing

1026
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:12,040
 with one of these unacknowledged projects, they will tell you, 'Well, we have an undisclosed

1027
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:16,640
 amount of money doing an undisclosed project, and you don't have a need to know,' and they

1028
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:21,240
 will then just rubber-stamp what's going into Northrop Grumman, or Lockheed Martin, or Science

1029
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,560
 Applications International Corporation, or MITRE Corporation."

1030
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,360
 Now, I have a whole list.

1031
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:31,000
 One of the sections in here that I will provide for you, and Congressman Christopher Cox,

1032
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,960
 who later became Bush's head of the SEC, asked me to put this together for him, and it's

1033
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,680
 a list of the facilities and corporations and sub-corporations and sub-facilities where

1034
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,320
 this activity is going on.

1035
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,640
 This is actionable intelligence if anyone wants to follow up on it.

1036
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,920
 So yes, you can find out.

1037
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,260
 We have found out, but it's something that would have to be a concerted effort under

1038
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:58,080
 subpoena power by people who would not take no for an answer, and that I think the people

1039
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,080
 deserve.

1040
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,080
 Thank you.

1041
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:13,240
 Well, this is virtually the end of this panel, and the next one is about ready to start,

1042
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:21,640
 but I always have things that kind of hang in the air, because nothing we're learning

1043
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:26,680
 is going to make any difference if we can't do anything about it, if we don't.

1044
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:36,360
 And in 1995, the Rockefeller-funded conference in the Sylmar, my question, as you were talking

1045
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,200
 about it, was, well, what were their goals?

1046
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,000
 What did they accomplish?

1047
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,240
 And did anything really happen because of that?

1048
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:50,760
 And what we're doing today, this many years later, is there enough different out there

1049
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,040
 that we can make a difference this week?

1050
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:01,000
 Yes, ma'am, it's part of a process, and that meeting was a meeting to get together the

1051
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,480
 initial governmental witnesses and to create a support group for them.

1052
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,400
 I had grown men, old enough to be my grandfather, cry on my shoulder and say, "We've been wanting

1053
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:14,600
 to talk about this our whole lives," who were astronauts, who were cosmonauts.

1054
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,960
 I said, "Okay, let's do that," but they were afraid.

1055
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,760
 They had signed oaths saying that they would never talk about any of this stuff, and they

1056
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,640
 were afraid, and some of them had been in unacknowledged projects where they were told

1057
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:28,120
 they would be terminated, killed, if they talked about it, and this is true.

1058
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:33,880
 So it was a process, and what I wanted to have happen, in 1997, when we had the meetings

1059
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:39,020
 for various members of Congress, we had hoped that members of Congress who were chair of

1060
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,720
 committees would pick up this mantle.

1061
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:46,320
 I'm still working full-time as an emergency doctor with four daughters and a golden retriever,

1062
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,520
 and I have a life.

1063
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:53,520
 I was doing this as a sort of a voluntary thing, but unfortunately, no one really wanted

1064
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,520
 to pick this up.

1065
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,960
 But I think that if we come together as a people, we can do it.

1066
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:05,960
 Now, with this process, there's the possibility of galvanizing a larger movement, because

1067
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,800
 I think if the people will lead, the leaders will have to follow, but we have to get the

1068
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,800
 information that we have out.

1069
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:15,360
 But I think that to the extent that you folks could influence some of your colleagues who

1070
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,640
 are still in the Congress to take a serious interest in this, that isn't just a dog-and-pony

1071
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:26,480
 show of denial and ridicule, but really drills down on the, again, actionable intelligence

1072
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,260
 that we've put together over the last 15 years, I think that that would result to really the

1073
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:35,560
 lid coming off this thing and the people knowing the truth once and for all.

1074
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,560
 Thank you.

1075
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,560
 Thank you.

1076
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,560
 And now we're going to change panels.

1077
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:38,560
 [applause]
