1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
 The meeting is called to order.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,340
 Have we done the swearing in yet?

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,340
 We have not.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,340
 Okay.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,340
 Do you want to do the swearing in?

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,340
 I do.

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,620
 Thank you.

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,860
 And repeat after me.

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,700
 And feel free to say this in your native language.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:31,920
 I do hereby affirm that I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth to this committee

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,320
 today.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
 Thank you so much.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
 Gracias.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:48,040
 We have heard from a number of people this week that this phenomena has gone on.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,000
 And it will be interesting to hear what you have to say from a variety of countries in

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,160
 South America.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,460
 And I'm anxious to hear what all of you have to say.

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:09,960
 This is one of those hearings that I think our witnesses have all been absolutely fantastic.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,480
 They have been ex-military.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,440
 They have been people that have actually seen what's happened.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,540
 They have studied it.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,880
 They have done research.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,540
 And today we are very fortunate to have you here at this hearing.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,720
 And appreciate your coming and am anxious to hear what you have to say.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,120
 So I am not going to spend a lot of time talking because I want to hear what you have to say.

26
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,800
 So welcome.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,920
 And we will start out with, and if I don't say your name correctly, you will tell it

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,560
 to me, please.

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
 Is it Givard?

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
 Yes.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,040
 Mr. Givard from Brazil.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,520
 Thank you very much.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,200
 I would like to begin with by thanking all of you members of the Congress who has given

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,960
 your time and your effort, your attention to the subject.

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,780
 We are all really anxious to see the results of this.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,900
 I think it's a major step that has been done here in Washington, its history in making.

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:27,960
 And I'm very glad to be part of it along with my fellow researcher friends from South America.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,160
 And we are here from several countries in South America.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:40,720
 I have on my side, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, and Argentina, all of we are willing to invite

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,800
 you to dive into South American UFO research.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:57,720
 But before I go on, I would like to ask permission to you gentlemen and ladies to introduce my

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,280
 fellow research and friend from Brazil who is a businessman and is also a former congressman

43
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,440
 for the Brazilian Congress who is much, much likely to be again after July as he is the

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,800
 next one.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,760
 And this gentleman has given us in Brazil a strong support to development of the Brazilian

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,840
 ufology in several projects.

47
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,400
 Now he has some views that he would like to share with us, with you, and I would like to

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,280
 ask permission to introduce Mr. Wilson Pickler.

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,760
 I am absolutely delighted he's here.

50
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:42,160
 I understand from our short conversation that how your legislative process works and how

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,240
 ours works is quite different, but we may learn some lessons from you in the process.

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,040
 So welcome.

53
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,560
 Madam Chairperson, members of the committee, ladies and gentlemen, it's a great pleasure

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,080
 to speak in this conference.

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,440
 And I would like to congratulate the representatives of the American Congress for this important

56
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,800
 conference that will be remembered for the mankind forever.

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:21,800
 This is a beginning of a process of disclosure of the most important event for mankind lately.

58
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:30,600
 We wish for long to have contact with space people, and this fact has been hiding for

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
 the government for long.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,400
 Why the government decided to hide it from the people, such an important fact.

61
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,160
 Because we have heard here in this conference from the military, retired militaries, that

62
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,080
 these beings, extraterrestrial beings, have such a capability of interfering in the nuclear

63
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,200
 weapons systems, even activating and deactivating these weapons.

64
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,960
 This explains why governments hide these from the people, because it changed the balance

65
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:18,320
 of power in the entire world, and they are doing a campaign to take out the credibility

66
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
 of this phenomena.

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,120
 And those people that are working here for many years, working hard with difficultness,

68
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,480
 is passing through humiliations.

69
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
 Is it?

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 Humiliation?

71
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,720
 That's it.

72
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,920
 Because they say they do not exist, UFO do not exist.

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:45,920
 In fact, what we have heard here, they exist, they are here to save us against the insanity

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,760
 of our leaders.

75
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,200
 Because the powerful of these nuclear weapons can destroy the whole planet.

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,800
 I have heard them yesterday to prepare this speech.

77
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:07,880
 The power of the last detonation, which was by Russians, it is 3,333 times the power of

78
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,200
 Hiroshima bomb.

79
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,120
 So do you know the name the Russians put in that artifact?

80
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,440
 Translated to English, it is, "We will show you.

81
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,400
 It could be colored, must be colored.

82
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,440
 We hope we never use it."

83
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,200
 So just looking at the name of this artifact, like Hiroshima bomb, little boy.

84
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,420
 The other one, fat man.

85
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:45,240
 We can see what is the mentality of those people that are behind these weapons.

86
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,440
 And we declare, by the ufologist community, and also those ones that do not do research,

87
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,520
 but has in their heart, in their mind, a great wish to establish a friendships relationship

88
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,740
 with extraterrestrials.

89
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,480
 So what is happening here is really quite important for mankind.

90
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,160
 Congratulate for everybody that is organizing, taking part of this conference.

91
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,560
 Congratulations for the representatives of the American Congress.

92
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,720
 We are working towards the interests of the people of the Earth, and not the interests

93
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,600
 of few persons in the world that decide things for us, as it was already have been told here

94
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,560
 in this conference.

95
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,900
 And I would like to finish my speech.

96
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,880
 Thanks for the great architect of the universe to send these motherships to save us against

97
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,480
 our insanity.

98
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
 Thanks very much.

99
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
 Thank you.

100
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
 Thank you.

101
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 Excuse me.

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
 Thank you.

103
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:54,200
 And again, thank all of you for traveling a great distance to be here.

104
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,600
 I thought I traveled a long way just because I came across the United States, but thank

105
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
 you.

106
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,680
 I'd like to start out with Mr. Javarn.

107
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
 Thank you.

108
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,160
 Thank you, madam.

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 Thank you, Professor Wilson-Pickler.

110
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,520
 I must add that as when he gets back as a congressman in Brazilian Congress, he wants

111
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,040
 to do something like this inside the house, inside the Brazilian Congress, as an official

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,360
 part of its agenda.

113
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:31,560
 Now, what you will see this morning with my friends and my testimonies is a slightly different

114
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,060
 type of ufology, of UFO research.

115
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:43,000
 You will see that our continent, the South America, is by far the continent that has

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:53,040
 most number of agencies to officially investigate the UFO phenomenon, has now or have had in

117
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:01,320
 the past several entities, bodies inside the armed forces of several countries to investigate

118
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,520
 the UFO phenomenon.

119
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:09,520
 Right now, as we speak, there is a very active organization investigating UFOs in Uruguay

120
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,360
 that has been on for 20 some years, and in Chile that has been on since 1997 and on.

121
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,120
 Brazil has had many, Ecuador has had, Peru has had, Argentina already has.

122
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,480
 In South America, there is a different view towards this phenomenon.

123
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:36,320
 I will speak especially about Brazil, my country, and presenting myself before I go on, I would

124
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,680
 like to say that I am 51 years old and I have been devoting my life to this phenomenon since

125
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,120
 I was a kid.

126
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,880
 It is at least for 35 years that I am dedicating myself to the investigation of this phenomenon.

127
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,480
 I am the editor of a magazine that is one of the longest living magazines about UFOs

128
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
 in the world.

129
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:07,640
 30 years in existence, and I have specialized lately in finding out and interviewing retired

130
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:14,680
 personnel from the armed forces, mostly from Air Force, but also from Navy and from Army,

131
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,280
 to interview them, to extract from them information of how Brazil has dealt officially with the

132
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,720
 UFO phenomenon in the last 50 or 60 years.

133
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:37,040
 Now I will begin by saying that just two weeks ago, this time, we had a meeting between Brazilian

134
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,720
 civilian UFO researchers, six of us of the Brazilian Committee of UFO Researchers, with

135
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,800
 members of the armed forces, 10 personnel from Army, Air Force, and Navy at the Ministry

136
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,920
 of Defense of Brazil.

137
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,840
 That was a meeting, a historical meeting, that was called, we were invited by the Ministry

138
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,920
 of Defense of one of the largest countries in the world to deal with the UFO phenomenon.

139
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,280
 I would like to show you some pictures, please, Jennifer, of this meeting that took place

140
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,560
 on April 18th.

141
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,200
 This is our federal capital, this is Brasilia, it's a modern capital, please, the next one.

142
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:27,520
 We were received by officers of the Ministry of Defense of Brazil in the building of the

143
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,600
 Ministry of Defense, where we could meet not only this official, but also members of the

144
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,960
 Brazilian Air Force, Army, and Navy, as I showed.

145
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,800
 Again, another picture, please.

146
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,720
 There you can see this meeting that was being conducted by the Secretary of the Minister,

147
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,400
 Ambassador Celso Amorim, next please.

148
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,880
 This is the Brazilian Committee of UFO Researchers members, my fellow research colleagues in Brazil.

149
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
 Next please.

150
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
 Next please.

151
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
 Thank you.

152
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:11,800
 Now, it was given to us at this time a promise that we, the civilian UFO researchers, will

153
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:19,840
 have a clear, unobstructed channel of communication with our armored forces through the Ministry

154
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,360
 of Defense, because they are subordinated to the Ministry of Defense.

155
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,720
 It was also granted to us the promise that more papers and documents will be disclosed

156
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,360
 in the near future.

157
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:42,600
 We're talking about June, maybe July, that some hundred new pages of UFO documents will be released.

158
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,160
 Now, for those of you who don't have the details of it, let me tell you that Brazil has been

159
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,920
 involved officially in the investigation of the UFO phenomena for decades.

160
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,160
 Actually, it was one of the first countries in the world to officially admit that we are

161
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,720
 being visited by extraterrestrial powers, extraterrestrial civilization.

162
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:14,560
 It took place in 1954 in Rio de Janeiro when it was assembled, one gathering among military,

163
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,520
 top-ranking military from the Brazilian Air Force and members of the press and the society,

164
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,880
 and it was declared that the UFO phenomena is very serious, worth of scrutiny, and has

165
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,080
 to be fully investigated.

166
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:36,640
 That was in 1954, and from that moment on, Brazil has been involved in several projects,

167
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,240
 have held several projects mainly from the Brazilian Air Force to investigate it.

168
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:50,520
 We had in 1969 a body that was created inside the Brazilian Air Force to investigate the

169
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:58,160
 subject and it was called System of Investigation of Area of Phenomena, Area Unidentified Phenomena,

170
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,960
 so any, it was spread all over the country using all the installations of the Brazilian

171
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:12,160
 Air Force and it had conducted dozens of investigations all over, including of sightings of UFOs,

172
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:20,000
 chasing of aircrafts, landing of UFOs, including with extraterrestrial entities, extraterrestrial

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,360
 biologic entities outside the crafts.

174
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:32,800
 It was all documented in an official way by the Brazilian Air Force from 1969 to 1972.

175
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:45,200
 Now, a decade later, or two decades later, a decade later in 1977, we have had another

176
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,000
 very important program to investigate this phenomena in the Amazon, and in a particular

177
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,560
 area in the Amazon where the UFO phenomena was being observed by the inhabitants, especially

178
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,400
 of an island called Coladis.

179
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,040
 The situation was so intense.

180
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,480
 The UFOs was being observed all over that island and in large portions of the Amazon

181
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,520
 region that the Brazilian Air Force put together a committee of members to investigate the

182
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,840
 phenomena officially, and it was called Operation Saucer.

183
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,540
 Operation Saucer lasted from September 1977 to December 1977.

184
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:32,500
 It interviewed hundreds of people that were in contact with this phenomena.

185
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,480
 But more than that, it was the purpose of the Operation Saucer, first, to talk to the

186
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:47,100
 witnesses to see what are their reports, second, to try to document the presence of this phenomena.

187
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:55,960
 And over 500 pictures of UFO were produced, along with 16 hours of video, actually of

188
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:03,840
 footage and film, 8 millimeters and 16 millimeters, military-style films of UFOs in the Amazon,

189
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,560
 sometimes at close range.

190
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,920
 And the third objective of the Operation Saucer, and this is official from the Brazilian Air

191
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:18,480
 Force, was try to establish contact with intelligences beyond this phenomena.

192
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,440
 This is all very intense.

193
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:29,920
 2,000 pages have been produced by 3,000 men who took part in this operation.

194
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,080
 I was the one chosen by the commander of this operation 20 years after it was ended to interview

195
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:44,200
 him, and he gave me with a huge amount of details what went on in that period of time.

196
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,640
 Since then, I have been chasing the information about Operation Saucer in UFOs in Amazon forever

197
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,020
 and everywhere I could find.

198
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:59,120
 And I'm glad to bring, and I would like to get introduced to this proceeding results,

199
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:10,000
 440 pages, which is 20 percent of what there is, of official UFO documents from the Brazilian

200
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,800
 Air Force that register, including with photos, maps, radar detects, croquis, designs, all

201
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:25,200
 sorts of information related to the UFOs in the Amazon, and lots of this procedure were

202
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,060
 followed by American military in the Amazon.

203
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,060
 Thank you.

204
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:40,060
 Thank you very much.

205
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,600
 I think we're going to just go down the line, have everyone testify, and then come back

206
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,120
 for questions, if that's all right.

207
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
 Welcome.

208
00:17:50,120 --> 00:18:03,280
 And I'm probably going to butcher your last name, but Antonio Junel.

209
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
 Welcome to the committee.

210
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
 Thank you.

211
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,040
 Good morning, distinguished members of the panel.

212
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,480
 I already introduced myself on Monday, brought a little bit of my biography, so this time

213
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
 I will keep it.

214
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,000
 I will skip that part.

215
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,680
 I'm representing Chile, even though I'm not officially part of, member of that committee,

216
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:28,320
 but I know, as you know, I'm a Chilean-American, and I know the history of the Chilean official

217
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:36,680
 agency very well, so I will read now from my prepared statement.

218
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,620
 In recent years, Chile has become one of the world's leading nations in the official study

219
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,480
 and recognition of the UFO phenomenon.

220
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,440
 UFO agencies or departments have been traditionally been under the Air Force in most countries.

221
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,860
 In France, as we shall see in the next session, the effort is under the space agency.

222
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,240
 But Chile has taken a novel approach which makes logical sense.

223
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,480
 Its committee, known as CEFA, which is a translation for committee for the study of anomalous aerial

224
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,160
 phenomena, is under the Civil Aviation Agency, DGAC.

225
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:21,160
 In other words, it's like if the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration, had a UFO

226
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
 department.

227
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,280
 Chile's aviation agents, civil aviation agencies all over the world that deal with aircraft

228
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:35,120
 safety and navigation, and UFOs, though not regulated by human governmental agencies,

229
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,320
 are primarily flying in the air and could pose a threat to aviation safety.

230
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:47,300
 Chile has a rich history of UFO cases, some of them highly strange, like an incident involving

231
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:53,040
 a group of seven soldiers in a corporal near Putre in Chile's northern Atacama region

232
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:00,100
 near the border with Peru in 1977, the so-called time warp case of Corporal Valdez, which became

233
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,880
 the subject of my very first UFO article back in 1977.

234
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,240
 In the 1980s, Gustavo Rodriguez, an air traffic controller, began to collect cases involving

235
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,440
 pilots who would call the control tower asking if there was any traffic that could explain

236
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,600
 lights or objects they were seeing during the course of their flights.

237
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,240
 There were also incidents involving the scramble of military jets, a situation common to many

238
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,360
 countries of the world.

239
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,080
 In the mid-90s, Rodriguez received the support of General Ramon Vega, a former commander

240
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,860
 in chief of the Chilean Air Force and later a senator.

241
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,640
 I had the opportunity of meeting both Gustavo Rodriguez and General Vega during several

242
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,540
 trips to Santiago in the 1990s.

243
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,520
 I gave the general, in fact, a copy of the Lawrence Rockefeller-sponsored UFO briefing

244
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,200
 document which I had co-authored and which perhaps played a small role in marshaling

245
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,960
 the evidence for the creation of CEFA-A in 1997.

246
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,680
 During its first months, however, CEFA-A seemed rudderless until Air Force General retired

247
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,000
 Ricardo Bermudez, who was named director.

248
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,040
 General Bermudez was the director of the Technical School of Aeronautics, which trains air traffic

249
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,240
 controllers, and it was at this school, which I visited many times, where the commission

250
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
 was housed for a number of years.

251
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:35,320
 CEFA-A's mission is to "record and analyze all relevant reports concerning UAP, unidentified

252
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,840
 aerial phenomena, occurring within the national territory on the basis of a serious objective

253
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:49,280
 and scientific analysis with the purpose of determining any possible risk to air operations."

254
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,920
 In 2002, CEFA-A became essentially inactive for a number of years, but in December of

255
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:02,680
 2009, the DDIC, the Civil Aviation Agency, announced that CEFA-A was being reactivated

256
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,480
 and once again General Bermudez was brought back to direct it and Gustavo Rodriguez to

257
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,400
 serve as secretary.

258
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,200
 The committee's headquarters was moved to a new location at the National Aeronautics

259
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,340
 and Space Museum near the old airport of Los Cerrillos in Santiago.

260
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:28,120
 One of the first things they did was to launch an official website, and I have the URL address

261
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,520
 here, which is by far the best of all the South American official agencies, the website

262
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
 I mean.

263
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,480
 It contains several UFO aircraft incidents with audio recordings of pilot controlled

264
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,240
 tower communications, videos, documents, articles, and other data.

265
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,400
 CEFA-A has an external committee of advisors, which includes eight top scientists from the

266
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,520
 Chilean Commission of Nuclear Energy, Aerospace Medicine at Santiago University, astronomers

267
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,360
 from the Metropolitan and Catholic Universities, a plasma physicist from Santiago University,

268
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,680
 a geographer and expert on satellite imagery from Chile State University, and two psychologists.

269
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:18,280
 There is also a CEFA-A internal committee, which includes experts on operation safety,

270
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,880
 air control center, meteorology, air accidents investigations, aerospace engineering, and

271
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
 audiovisual.

272
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,200
 They also have representatives from each branch of the armed forces and the police.

273
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:40,400
 On August 11, 2008, the Chilean government passed law 20285, known as transparency law.

274
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,320
 In some respects, it works similarly to our Freedom of Information Act.

275
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,120
 Government agencies have 20 days to respond to queries from the public regarding public

276
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
 records.

277
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,680
 But in some respects, it goes beyond the FOIA.

278
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,880
 With exception of matters dealing with national security and foreign relations, the transparency

279
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,400
 law was designed so government agencies can act in an open and transparent manner, even

280
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,720
 in cases where they receive no queries from the public.

281
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,200
 CEFA-A has fully complied with the requirements of the transparency law, and as explained

282
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,880
 by General Bermudez, "This is the way we deal with the phenomena, openly and freely."

283
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:28,720
 CEFA-A has documented many UFO cases involving commercial and military pilots.

284
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,480
 One of the more interesting ones, known as the Pelican case, occurred on June 24, 2010,

285
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,560
 and it involved three different aircraft, two airliners and a Navy plane called Pelican.

286
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,080
 As put by General Bermudez at a lecture he gave at the International UFO Congress in

287
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,280
 Fountain Hills, Arizona in 2012, "Three airplanes witnessed the same phenomenon.

288
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,240
 Two commercial planes are approaching Santiago.

289
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,020
 The military plane is coming 300 miles from the north, and an object is cruising his airway.

290
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,940
 The pilot reports something he sees camouflaged in erratic motion.

291
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,880
 In the audio communication, one can hear the pilot saying, 'Roger, at this moment, I can't

292
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,280
 see it anymore.

293
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,960
 I could see a traffic loud and clear.

294
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:24,560
 It looked like a cloud, camouflaged as a cloud, but with erratic motion.'"

295
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:30,520
 This case, as well as another one in Punta Arenas, detected by primary radar in 2011,

296
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:36,180
 is important because you have different professional pilots reporting the same object.

297
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,480
 As explained by General Bermudez, quote, "Think for a moment.

298
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,820
 If one experienced commercial pilot reports to me that something flew across in front

299
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,440
 of his airplane, I pay careful attention.

300
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,520
 But now, if a second commercial pilot reports the same a few seconds later, I become interested.

301
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,000
 But if a third pilot, a military one, confirms the same fact, I tend to believe it."

302
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,040
 In this case, do we have one UFO close to the airplanes, or do we have two UFOs?

303
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:17,720
 If we have one, its incredible speed doesn't correspond to anything we have now, 300 miles,

304
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,860
 you know, like in a couple of minutes.

305
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,360
 During the same lecture at the International UFO Congress, General Bermudez released a

306
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,280
 multiple video case taken at the El Bosque base in Santiago, where the Air Force Academy

307
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,560
 is located, which made world headlines.

308
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,140
 This was because several videos were taken during an important ceremony for the change

309
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:48,840
 of the commander of the Chilean Air Force on November 4, 2010, attended by the president,

310
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,640
 all the commanders of the armed forces and top brass, the minister of defense, and other

311
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,760
 cabinet members, the diplomatic corps, and many other important officials, including

312
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,960
 General Bermudez himself.

313
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,960
 The ceremony is popular with the public and widely photographed and filmed because it

314
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,800
 includes the air parade by all the different squadrons of the Chilean Air Force.

315
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,200
 It must be clarified, however, that none of the dignitaries or public saw the UFOs at

316
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,380
 the time.

317
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:23,560
 These were discovered later as people began to review the footage they had taken.

318
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,320
 I'm enclosing an interview I did with General Bermudez, published in Open Minds Magazine

319
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,900
 issue 16, October, November 2012, where he explains the methodology of CFA, as well as

320
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:43,560
 many of their best UFO cases, including the multiple footage case of El Bosque.

321
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:50,040
 CFA has shown that a serious and open official investigation of UFOs can be conducted in

322
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,960
 a serious and scientific manner.

323
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,520
 Some of the ingredients include cooperation among different government agencies, scientific

324
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,780
 and academic institutions, and even the civilian UFO community.

325
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,540
 Official and private investigators can and should cooperate instead of fighting with

326
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,200
 each other.

327
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,440
 The same model has taken place in other South American countries, like Uruguay, Brazil,

328
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,160
 Argentina, Peru, and Ecuador.

329
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:25,040
 Another key component is to establish official cooperation among different countries, since

330
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,620
 UFOs don't seem to care about national boundaries and are reported widely all over the world.

331
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:38,760
 For this reason, CFA and Kridovny, the official UFO agency run by the Uruguayan Air Force

332
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,980
 since 1978, signed an official agreement of cooperation and exchange of data in 2012.

333
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,360
 And we have here with us Colonel Sanchez, who was in fact the person that signed that

334
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,360
 agreement with General Bermudez.

335
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,480
 The United States likes to think that it's always ahead in all areas of society, but

336
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,880
 I'm afraid that this is not the case in the field of ufology.

337
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,100
 Other countries are moving ahead with an open and transparent investigation of this phenomenon.

338
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:16,080
 The unknown nature of the phenomenon itself and the likelihood that it originates not

339
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:23,280
 on this earth requires a change of attitude and a level of openness that seems to be amiss

340
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
 in this country.

341
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,280
 Let me finish with a quote from my interview with General Bermudez.

342
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,560
 Now I'm quoting him, "The official conclusion is that the anomalous aerial phenomenon known

343
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,920
 as unidentified flying objects is real and is present within the controlled airspace

344
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,560
 and outside the controlled airspace.

345
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,640
 It is also present in the sea.

346
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,480
 We have some reports from our Navy in that respect.

347
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,560
 It is present everywhere and therefore it is necessary to share the information in order

348
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,860
 to have more background and be able to study it more scientifically so that we can give

349
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:10,440
 real information to the people and not rely on what is shown in TV and in the sensationalist

350
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,560
 media."

351
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,040
 Thank you very much.

352
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:20,800
 Thank you.

353
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:30,520
 General Ariel Sanchez, I think we might need our microphones on.

354
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,080
 Welcome.

355
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,400
 Thank you.

356
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:52,080
 Ladies and gentlemen, I am Ariel Sanchez Ruiz.

357
00:30:52,080 --> 00:31:01,360
 I'm a retired Uruguay Colonel of the Armed Forces and I belong to the reception and denouncements

358
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:09,920
 in Uruguay of UFOs that works together with the official Uruguay Air Force that takes

359
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:17,080
 care of all the citizens' reports of non-identified objects.

360
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:27,640
 I was a technical director and I have been 23 years researching this subject.

361
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:36,400
 I have retired from the Air Forces about nine months but I also worked as a specializing

362
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:50,240
 in air transit, specialization of air transit, and a professor of the School of Estado Mayor.

363
00:31:50,240 --> 00:32:02,920
 I'm also a director of the Center for Exploration of Non-Civil Research of the UFO OVNI locally.

364
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:12,720
 Uruguay in these groups of investigation has about 1,300 cases that have been investigated

365
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,000
 for a long 30 years with 3% of these cases that have non-conventional characteristics.

366
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:32,360
 Uruguay is a small country with only 3,250,000 inhabitants in a land of 176,215 square feet.

367
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:39,520
 Its principal industry of Uruguay is cattle and raising and agriculture.

368
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:50,040
 1979 was created an office for the citizens' reporting of unidentified objects, most reiterated

369
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:56,320
 based on the 1970s, but the first registers started up in 1942.

370
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:05,400
 The Air Force is in charge of the safety of the country's air and the safety of the populace

371
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,800
 and also the passengers and airplanes.

372
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:18,840
 It takes care of all the denounces from all the media reports about what people have been

373
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,280
 notifying of UFOs.

374
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:38,760
 Here in these 33 years of activity, the Uruguay command of the Air Force has given any information

375
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:51,760
 of the diffusion or stopped the reporting of all this information.

376
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,720
 Through this commission, we are not rejecting or hiding or changing the situations that

377
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,160
 have been lived or experienced by the citizens that are reporting.

378
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,920
 It's only just taking the reports of the citizens.

379
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:17,200
 It's only just to make scientific studies about this phenomena that has been also, the

380
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,760
 Air Force has been researching.

381
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,720
 A lot of interviews have been done with all these people that were interested in this

382
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:41,360
 subject and reporters with the spirit of research and non-bias that could come together to work

383
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:48,200
 as a group to maximize all these research.

384
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:59,280
 In 7 of August in 1979, three officers were nominated for all this recopilation and analysis

385
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:09,040
 and 20 civil researchers were also called in to the help.

386
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:19,640
 LACRI OVNI is an organization that is a governmental institute, but it works as a public office

387
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:26,080
 for military and civil reports.

388
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:42,200
 The Uruguay Regional Research Civil Group that is non-governmental has the object to

389
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:51,840
 compile all the South American groups that are reporting about these UFO views and compile

390
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,720
 all the details into a bank of information.

391
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:16,760
 The results of this idea in 2012, two forces joined, Chile had been doing the first cooperation

392
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:23,320
 exchange with the international press with all this research.

393
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:35,440
 LACRI OVNI would like to use the same type of elements to review and incorporate all

394
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,240
 the research on these reports.

395
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:52,400
 After a few different trials, we adapted all this research as a commission with a president

396
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,360
 and a vice president and a secretary and an operative direction and technical and also

397
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,000
 to achieve any statistics.

398
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,520
 This commission was created to analyze all the cases before it was created and all the

399
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,880
 new cases that were coming up and being reported.

400
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,640
 Some problems were also faced to find conclusions that would be valid to apply to all the research.

401
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,440
 The first problem was how can we investigate?

402
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,400
 The second problem was how to evaluate something that we don't know what it is.

403
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:41,040
 So the decision was to opt a discussion that was open without prejudice or bias to explore

404
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:50,060
 the phenomena, to analyze all the studies that will be able to compile all the reports

405
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,760
 and all the events.

406
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:02,560
 First we started to study the UFOs first and the non-identified objects and anything that

407
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:10,720
 relates with it, like the territory, the people, any effects, any objects, animals, or anything

408
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,160
 that could be in relation to this UFOs.

409
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:24,080
 And all the revelations that people had been reporting, whether it was spiritual or mystic,

410
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:37,080
 we found out that it was a phenomenon that could absorb different opinions and different

411
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,240
 phenomena together into one.

412
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,480
 Why was this occurring?

413
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:55,600
 This phenomenon was absolutely unknown, that was presented and causing a lot of difficulties

414
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:06,360
 to study, having the spirit of curiosity and investigation to adjust our studies into the

415
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:14,560
 scientific responsibility and a methodology of research to be adequate for this research

416
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:23,100
 and evaluation to a qualification of the systems.

417
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:30,840
 Two pillars were the basis, the recollection of the information collected and the study

418
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:41,800
 of the comparative events in the phenomena, the questions asked, where we have people

419
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:51,200
 that will interrogate all the details and make conclusions, what possibilities it is

420
00:39:51,200 --> 00:40:03,480
 that the testimony is not true, and the third, people that would have seen the events.

421
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:11,400
 What is the possibility to be a psychological illusion, the questions were negative or partial

422
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,760
 or there was any doubt that was reasonable to corroborate with the scientific research.

423
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,820
 What is the possibility that this phenomena is not conventional?

424
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:33,440
 We don't know what it is, but we can also identify the methodology had a possibility

425
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,560
 of percentage that we don't know what it is and cannot identify, we cannot tell what

426
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,840
 it is, and we cannot identify with anything known or conventional.

427
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:54,800
 Finally, to evaluate all this information, we have a system that will give us the opportunity

428
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:04,400
 to corroborate the veracity and filter all the details that we can submit to work together

429
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,680
 with international groups to work together and our model of organization I would like

430
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:20,640
 to offer our methodology of working to create an office to study this subject and we can

431
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,520
 submit on the United Nations so we can, together with the rest of the world, lift the veil

432
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,040
 and find out the exact details of what this phenomena is.

433
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
 Thanks.

434
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:39,160
 Thank you.

435
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,360
 Yes, Anthony Choi from Peru, welcome.

436
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:53,160
 I'm greeting you ladies and gentlemen to address in the panel.

437
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
 Very good morning.

438
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,240
 My name is Anthony Choi.

439
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,200
 I'm going to read my declaration.

440
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:04,400
 I am a lawyer and a media reporter for investigation.

441
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:12,880
 I am the main investigator of the non-identified objects and I have attended the Area War School

442
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,520
 of Peru and Space for Peru.

443
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,720
 I am the main investigator for the official UFO research of Peru, founded on 1st November

444
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,600
 on 1971.

445
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:37,200
 I have been investigating for 13 years this phenomena in Peru and I have also a radio

446
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,280
 program in Peru which is one of the most important in Pan America.

447
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:51,240
 I would like to go, please, to image number one, please, around 7 p.m. on 13th of October

448
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,640
 2001 in the skies of this city.

449
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,040
 There's a city where there is a strange light.

450
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,280
 This is north of Peru with the frontier with Ecuador.

451
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:10,280
 We're going to see the image number two, eight light spheres appear and then on the

452
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:17,120
 right side up here you'll see intense lights.

453
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:25,400
 Color is orange and dozens of witnesses have observed this.

454
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:34,200
 These lights have been for two and a half hours, absolutely in silence and forming figures

455
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:43,800
 that were geometric alignments, so somehow they were giving a light show for all the

456
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,240
 witnesses and then suddenly disappeared.

457
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:55,280
 25th of October, another luminous object about 25 meters of diameter.

458
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,520
 We can see one of the witnesses pointing to it.

459
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:05,920
 Site number six, please, appears hovering in the sky and the city was accompanied by

460
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:19,200
 another spheres of light, one of which landed, quote, unquote, so it landed in a nearby hillside.

461
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,840
 The whole view lasted 26 minutes.

462
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:30,000
 This is part of a video that we extracted these images from the video.

463
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,200
 That's when he landed the witnesses unanimously.

464
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,400
 They had heard a greeting on their head.

465
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,960
 It was like a greeting.

466
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,960
 They heard, hello.

467
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:48,840
 And lastly, on November 15th, another red luminous sphere descended on the same city,

468
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,600
 which after a few minutes, it disappeared.

469
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,980
 These events, we should note, were recorded on three videos, copies of which we are turning

470
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,760
 over to the committee so that you can look at them.

471
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,680
 They were recorded by Ivan Issa Nanfardo, who was a cameraman from that community, and

472
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,040
 I asked him for a copy so that I could begin my respective investigation.

473
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:16,760
 In the media, the case was called the Chulucanas incident, and the videos were turned over

474
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,760
 to the Peruvian Air Force and given to Peruvian Air Force Commander Julio Chamorro-Flores,

475
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,520
 who is the chief of the Peruvian Air Force's UFO investigation office.

476
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,240
 He instructed me to proceed with my investigation.

477
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:38,640
 The investigation was able to document statements from dozens of witnesses.

478
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:46,760
 However, they were also able to confirm a very significant event, most of which were

479
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:53,200
 unfamiliar to people around the world, and this is something that many investigators

480
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,200
 need to know.

481
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,000
 South America, perhaps right now, is the area where there are the largest number of sightings.

482
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,160
 It is surprising how the world, even the United States of America, are unaware of this situation.

483
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,960
 I think much of this has to do with the role of the media.

484
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:17,640
 And just as a matter of example, I'm going to point out a few of these cases.

485
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:25,200
 In 1959, during a military training flight of a squadron of four P-47 planes near the

486
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,620
 city of Chulucanas, Peruvian Air Force Captain Ernesto Arancivia Linares had an encounter

487
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,120
 with a UFO that shut down his plane's engine.

488
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,080
 It was hovering in the air for an hour, and during which time Captain Arancivia states

489
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,680
 that he had an encounter and communication with the alleged crew members who, based on

490
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:52,200
 his testimony, official testimony, seemed to be humans with Nordic features.

491
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,960
 Captain Arancivia reported this to his command, but his command never made this public.

492
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,440
 Okay, can we see slides nine and ten?

493
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,360
 This is retired Captain Arancivia right now, and this is an illustration that he drew,

494
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:16,320
 his description of this UFO that he saw hovering in the air for an hour.

495
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,840
 And now we'll see our slide number 11.

496
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:25,360
 In 2002, during a nighttime military training flight in the area close to Moropon, very

497
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:31,240
 close to Chulucanas, Peruvian Air Force Captain Germán Shrock Castillo and another pilot,

498
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,960
 after receiving a report from a commercial flight and flying at an altitude of 12,000

499
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:44,480
 feet, detected an unexplainable, perfect circle outlined by fire of an immense diameter of

500
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,680
 between 15 and 18 kilometers.

501
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:54,080
 No explanation for that phenomenon could be found, nor was this ever revealed to the public.

502
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:02,840
 In 2004, and now we'll see image number 12, a team from the Univision Television Network

503
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:08,800
 in Denver, Colorado, traveled to the area to work on a news report on UFOs.

504
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,400
 And on August 6th of that year, at approximately 1.33 a.m., this team was able to record a

505
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:26,120
 video of a strange object flying over Cerro Pilán.

506
00:48:45,400 --> 00:49:06,240
 The Colonel José Ratti from FAP Airspace Director of Peru, representing the Peru Air

507
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:13,680
 Force, the first officer officially of a case that was recognized to all media of communications.

508
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:21,160
 The initiative, we must recognize the courage action of Peru Air Force to dedicate time

509
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:30,480
 to open up this information, being the third in Latin America group to report these incidents.

510
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:38,400
 The city of Chulucan, their chiefs of this report have been inexplicably stolen and are

511
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:54,640
 missing from FAP, the official UFO reporting agency in Peru, in regards to this UFO case.

512
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:19,440
 The city of Chulucan, the first official investigation of a case of UFO to be disclosed.

513
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:32,800
 The archives have been missing.

514
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:50,520
 We're going to see image number 18, the testimony of the people seeing all these events in Peru.

515
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:56,960
 It's mostly on the Peruvian territory, very, very, very long history of my country, Peru.

516
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,440
 In Cusco, this is a photograph that's been taken.

517
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,920
 This is a very significant event.

518
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:17,920
 Peru is one of the six places that for 6,000 years that we have human inhabitation, the

519
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,760
 Mayas ancestry.

520
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:35,320
 That exists also evidence that there is pilots that have encounters in space.

521
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:44,720
 That they have shown a completely unknown performance in the airspace.

522
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:52,960
 That they have been turned down for informing anything in regards to this event.

523
00:51:52,960 --> 00:52:03,920
 1980s, my colleagues and I, we commence studying these events.

524
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:14,520
 My presence here is to confront that the United States and other regions of the world are

525
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,920
 not willing to acknowledge this phenomenon.

526
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:27,480
 But this requires a global response in regards to the research of this phenomenon.

527
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:40,000
 These events and these UFOs that are originating out of the Earthly space and the performance

528
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:50,680
 of these non-identified objects and phenomena and the citizens that are reporting witnessing.

529
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:59,280
 We are in front of one of the most important mysteries of the contemporary time.

530
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,640
 This is a simple and powerful event.

531
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:12,640
 The interaction with other civilizations of the world and learning about our visitors.

532
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:24,960
 They are influencing our society in present times.

533
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:31,320
 We are immersed in the process of preparation to open up all these phenomena.

534
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:41,680
 It's about 60 years that this phenomenon has been studied in my country, but the governments

535
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:51,400
 are protectionists or interested in not disclosing the information pertaining to this phenomenon

536
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,520
 of unidentified objects.

537
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:02,480
 And also, the reporters, they are abandoning the spirit of research instead of reporting

538
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,080
 the real truth.

539
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:15,680
 But in our planet, we have an obligation to comment about this and research.

540
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:27,200
 We are sharing with other civilizations that are of world in the main time the healing

541
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:36,200
 of our community in regards to this.

542
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:42,360
 Thank you very much.

543
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:47,040
 And next we have Colonel Oscar Santamaria.

544
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,560
 Welcome.

545
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,560
 Good morning.

546
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:58,240
 A cordial greeting and thanking the Commission and my thanks for inviting me to present this

547
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,240
 information.

548
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,200
 I'm Mr. Huertas.

549
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:09,320
 I have been a combat pilot of Peru's Air Force, and I would like to present a document to

550
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,840
 the U.S. Department of Defense.

551
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:28,400
 Please, first image.

552
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:36,320
 You can see that here, this document was a 1982 document that was produced by the U.S.

553
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:47,240
 Department of Defense informing in the near of the La Jolla, south of Peru base, there

554
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,680
 was several opportunities, a UFO reported first in the morning time, the second time

555
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,840
 in the times of the evening of the next day.

556
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:08,840
 The UFO that appeared in the morning, an airplane, SU-22, tried to intercept it and destroy it

557
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:16,520
 without being lucky in the objective.

558
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,720
 It was ineffective to try to destroy this UFO.

559
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,760
 Second page, there's more details about this event given the name of the base and other

560
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,040
 details pertaining.

561
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:41,200
 The pilot that was driving, I was the pilot that was piloting this airplane, and I will

562
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:52,360
 be very happy to narrate and explain the events that occurred.

563
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,160
 I was the pilot in this airplane trying to intercept the UFO.

564
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:11,320
 In the area base of La Jolla in the Department of Arequipa in the south of Peru, 11 April

565
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:22,200
 1980, in the morning, 1,800 people, civil and military, that they were part of the base

566
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:30,080
 could observe at the end of the landing strip an object that looked like an aerostatic globe

567
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:37,040
 suspended in the air, about five kilometers of distance and 1,500 of altitude.

568
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:48,960
 The system of radars did not detect this globe approaching, and this object did not respond

569
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,880
 to the tower of control messages.

570
00:57:53,880 --> 00:58:03,700
 This was a strange location that was not allowed except for military, so we thought it was

571
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:12,680
 a espionage for this military base, and it could be considered a danger for the security

572
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,900
 of the country.

573
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:23,720
 So the squad was ordered that one of the pilots did have to go up in the air and follow the

574
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,720
 object and destroy the object.

575
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:36,520
 The air command gave me the order to take off and to shoot this object before it approaches

576
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,480
 too fast to the base.

577
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:55,040
 So I first approached this object, and this airplane that I was piloting had military

578
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,040
 weapons.

579
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:06,240
 I did an ascent from the right to the 1,500 kilometers of height, and I initiated the

580
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,720
 attack procedures.

581
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:24,760
 When I was close to the object, I threw away a charge of missiles, but this globe never

582
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:33,920
 got any damages and started ascending and living in a very, very fast pace.

583
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:44,440
 During the persecution of this globe, I had a 900 kilometers per hour speed, but I couldn't

584
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,360
 reach him.

585
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:58,720
 When I arrived to 84 kilometers of distance from the base, this globe stopped very quickly.

586
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:10,700
 I had to make a very quick maneuver to avoid confrontation.

587
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:18,600
 When I wasn't getting close to shooting again at the distance, the object did a very fast

588
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:25,640
 movement and went underneath my airplane without allowing me to shoot.

589
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:36,800
 Our locations evaded my location and avoided on the last minute all my intent to shoot.

590
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,200
 Confronted with this situation, I took the decision to speed on a very high velocity

591
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:50,120
 and ascend very high to go ahead and attack in a very vertical manner, but the globe did

592
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:59,680
 have a maneuver of lifting very, very quickly, so I wasn't able to focus to shoot.

593
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:11,240
 The next view, I accelerated my airplane to get to 1.6 mach, approximately 1,850 kilometers

594
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,720
 per hour, and I began to ascend.

595
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:22,520
 I surpassed the position of the balloon, and I hoped to be able to be high enough to get

596
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:30,440
 into my attack maneuver, but I was surprised when the balloon, again, quickly ascended

597
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:44,720
 and was able to get alongside my plane, and therefore I was unable to attack it.

598
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:50,720
 With the UFO parallel to my plane, I kept going up, hoping to be able to surpass it

599
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,080
 to be able to get into attack position, but I was unable to do so.

600
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:06,880
 So we got up to 19,200 meters, about 63,000 feet, as you can see here, where the balloon

601
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:13,280
 stopped its ascent, and I tried to, again, get it in my sights to be able to fire, but

602
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,160
 it was impossible.

603
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:22,860
 At that point, my low-fuel light came on, saying that I had just enough fuel to get

604
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,920
 back to land.

605
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:32,400
 Since I could no longer continue my attack, I approached it, got to a distance of about

606
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,600
 100 meters, and I was able to see that this balloon was not a balloon.

607
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:47,560
 It was about 10 meters in diameter, and on the top it had an enamelled, a non-metallic

608
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:53,640
 cream-colored enamelled dome, and that in its base it had a wide, silver, circular metallic

609
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,440
 surface.

610
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:01,960
 It did not have any wings, jet propulsion, windows, antenna, anything like that.

611
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:08,280
 These are obviously surfaces that aircraft usually have; pulling myself together, I went

612
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,400
 back to the air base, and I reported to the control tower what I had seen.

613
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:20,480
 In total, there were 22 minutes of maneuvers that are clearly etched in my brain, and I

614
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:31,780
 am convinced that there is extraterrestrial technology and life.

615
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:40,920
 I will never forget what I saw that day, and this is a sketch of what I saw.

616
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,780
 If you could go on to the next slide.

617
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:55,220
 It more or less looked like this, and the two next slides we can see.

618
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:59,460
 This is a photo of me with my plane.

619
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,520
 This is from 1980.

620
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,880
 Next slide, please.

621
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,240
 This is a Sukui 22.

622
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,240
 Thank you very much.

623
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,240
 That is the end of my remarks.

624
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:23,240
 That must have been some ride.

625
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:34,800
 And then we have Alejandro Chinoti.

626
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:41,140
 Welcome.

627
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:46,360
 Well it is a great honor to be here with you, members of Congress.

628
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:52,080
 I do not represent any official Argentinian group.

629
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:58,600
 I am a news producer for the third largest Spanish channel here in the United States

630
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,920
 and have been here for many years.

631
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:09,180
 But despite that, I have not stopped investigating my dear country of Argentina, and I thank

632
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,600
 you for this great invitation.

633
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:19,240
 I am happy to be here on behalf of Argentina and other countries.

634
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:23,880
 So these UFO investigation projects are nothing new in my life.

635
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:29,080
 As an investigative reporter and field researcher, I have investigated many cases that were investigated

636
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:36,320
 before and after the event by official groups or through subsequent historical reviews.

637
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:42,520
 From my very early childhood, I was a part of a civil investigation group that sought

638
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:52,040
 cooperation with official entities and we, the special and noble species called UFOlogists.

639
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:59,720
 In the 1980s, my group, the UFO Investigations Commission, or CU as it is known, which is

640
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:10,160
 directed by Dr. Joseph Allen Heineck, who is a recognized astronomer and advisor to

641
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:21,280
 the Blue Book Project, chose us as representatives of this organization as editors of its bulletin

642
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,320
 in Spanish in the International UFO Report.

643
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:30,960
 At that time, Heineck was seeking international exchange and the timing was perfect.

644
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:37,640
 We brought him to the National Commission for Space Studies, called NIE, with the hopes

645
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:44,520
 to reinvigorate our efforts and help this phenomenon to be taken seriously and receive

646
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,640
 support in the investigation of recent cases like the crash that had happened in the north

647
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,680
 of Patagonia.

648
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:57,280
 Investigations in Argentina began with Navy projects and then later they went to the National

649
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:02,160
 Gendarmerie as well as the Air Force.

650
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:08,480
 Global projects began to gain support in the 1960s.

651
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:14,320
 There was the famous case of Captain Miotti that I was able to investigate research years

652
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,500
 later in Yacanto, a province of Cordoba.

653
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:25,920
 There was a sighting of a conical-shaped object on a foggy morning and it was photographed

654
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,440
 clearly and it was analyzed by the National Aeronautics Service.

655
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:38,040
 They concluded that there was a dark part on the underside of the object showing absorption

656
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,160
 of light or radiation.

657
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:47,080
 This was one of the first speculations about the possible energy aspect to UFOs.

658
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:52,480
 I'm not sure if we actually have a copy of this image in my PowerPoint.

659
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,800
 If it is there, we can project it.

660
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,160
 If not, we'll continue.

661
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:04,680
 My first contact with classified archives came through my friendship with journalist

662
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:10,760
 Eduardo Azcuy, who was one of the first advisers to the Navy on the naval project.

663
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:19,760
 In the 1960s, the Navy was on alert for the apparition of submerged objects that were

664
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:25,040
 not detected by sonar and they moved at high speeds.

665
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,520
 Sometimes they would fly and they were in the form of a cigar.

666
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:35,420
 We called these unidentified submerged objects or USOs.

667
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:45,520
 These cases were pursued with the support of American ships and they helped in the research.

668
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:51,200
 Unfortunately, there are no declassified documents on these cases.

669
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:57,040
 The first official group of the Navy was called COPEFO, which was the permanent commission

670
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:04,280
 for the study of UFOs and it was led by now late Captain Omar Parani.

671
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:12,600
 Years later, in the Argentinian and Chilean bases in Antarctica, there were multiple sightings.

672
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:19,920
 It was a multicolored disk that led to magnetic disturbances in the detector's radar on both

673
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,000
 bases.

674
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:29,120
 In 1965, personnel from the Deception Island, also in Antarctica, were able to take a single

675
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,600
 photo.

676
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,960
 This was with underwater volcanoes.

677
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:45,120
 In terms of the chronology of acknowledgement of official cases, I made a list of declassified

678
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,160
 cases.

679
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,480
 The '70s were a particularly busy time, but this began in the '60s.

680
01:09:53,480 --> 01:10:00,760
 In 1962, a fighter plane squadron from the Esporta base, which is inside the Buenos Aires

681
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:09,440
 province, detected UFOs on the landing strip and they made an attempt to intercept them.

682
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:14,000
 In 1965, the same thing happened in that same area.

683
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:22,680
 This is an area that is very dry and hot and there was a great concentration of sightings

684
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,680
 in the '60s.

685
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:32,240
 In 1978, there was a very interesting case in El Dique de la Florida where a UFO landed

686
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:36,200
 and there was a humanoid who exited.

687
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:41,640
 There were a number of witnesses to this.

688
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:48,840
 The next year, I met with some of the witnesses and the police of the province provided an

689
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:55,280
 official communique where they talked about the prints that were found on the ground from

690
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,280
 that being.

691
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:05,160
 That year, the provincial police published a document where they showed a giant UFO that

692
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,080
 actually had an impact on the train rails.

693
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:17,840
 In 1982, in Catamarca, which is a province in a town that's curiously called London,

694
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:27,560
 and that happens a lot on the Falkland Islands, but the police saw an object that had showed

695
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:31,480
 deflagration that produced great destruction.

696
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:41,160
 The chief of police issued an official report and I was the only investigator at that time

697
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,080
 when I arrived after the event.

698
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:49,760
 In 1986, in Cordova, in Cerro El Pajarillo, which is one of the communities in El Huitorco,

699
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:56,560
 Cruz de Eje, there was a print that seemed to be the crash of a UFO.

700
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,120
 The regional authorities accepted this case as one that was strange and one that needed

701
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,240
 to be investigated.

702
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:14,400
 Between '87 and '89, a commission was created under the armed forces and it was led by a

703
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:25,280
 great friend of mine, Julio Goxena-Aguaro, and it was very important in the province

704
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:33,120
 of Entre Rios, there was a phenomenon of UFOs that would actually have an impact on the

705
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:40,080
 ground and I had the opportunity of taking video and investigate this over several years.

706
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:46,240
 In 2009, Argentinian investigation groups were united under a single association called

707
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:52,960
 CEFORA, which is the Commission for the Study of UFO Phenomena in the Argentinian Republic.

708
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:59,920
 They included scientists, investigators, and members of the military and they sought to

709
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:07,840
 access in a methodological and systematic way the secret archives related to UFOs.

710
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:20,840
 One of the first groups that was being pushed by this commission was the support and acceptance

711
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:27,360
 by the Argentinian Air Force, which decided to create, three years ago, CEFA, which is

712
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:32,440
 the Commission on Aerospace Phenomena Study.

713
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,760
 This was under the leadership of Captain Mariano Mohabt and a few civilians.

714
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:46,040
 They have investigation brigades like Carlos Ferguson, Carlos Urchuk, and Andrea Simondini.

715
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:53,280
 The second phase, which continues today, is under the guise of Commodore Guillermo Aloy.

716
01:13:53,280 --> 01:14:01,440
 The first official investigation took place in September of 2011, when a glowing ball

717
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:07,720
 fell from the sky and led to a lethal and tremendous explosion in Monte Grande, which

718
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,520
 is in the province of Buenos Aires.

719
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:17,800
 This case remains unsolved, it's alleged that it could have been a gas explosion, but

720
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:23,600
 the public and civilian investigators continue to rule that possibility out.

721
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:31,940
 There was great destruction and one person was killed in the course of this incident.

722
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:40,440
 With respect to UFOs, this Air Force Commission has clarified that its work is not focused

723
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:48,000
 on proving the existence of extraterrestrial life, rather it is a scientific study that

724
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,280
 can lead to the truth.

725
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:56,640
 Sephora has continued to ask for the declassification of documentation on this case and the previous

726
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,480
 cases.

727
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,400
 There's a case in Guadalupe, Polanco.

728
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:10,680
 This was a case of the Argentinian airline where the pilot saw a UFO that attempted to land

729
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,320
 in the Bariloche airport.

730
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:20,960
 The object went in front of the plane and took an escape route.

731
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:27,400
 The crew was very frightened and all radio signals and communication with the airport

732
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,600
 were cut off.

733
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:37,480
 At the same time, there was a general blackout in the city and a gendarmerie plane saw the

734
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,320
 danger of the situation at the same time.

735
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:46,000
 So Sephora was able to get transcripts of the communications between the aircraft and

736
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
 the tower.

737
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:54,160
 However, it has not been able to obtain the documentation prepared by the gendarmerie.

738
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:58,920
 They have recently begun to declassify cases like the case of Campo de Mayo in the province

739
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,200
 of Buenos Aires from November 1972.

740
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:11,340
 At this time, an object in the shape of a half moon, which had a light of a smaller

741
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:17,200
 size underneath, began to make emergency maneuvers.

742
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:25,040
 So Sephora is currently in talks with different ministries for UFO declassification.

743
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:30,920
 One is the Ministry of Defense, under which the Air Force and the Navy fall, and the other

744
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:38,480
 is the Ministry of Security, which includes the national gendarmerie and the prefecture.

745
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:44,840
 Sephora has brought together more than 1,000 citizen signatures for the presentation of

746
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:51,200
 a bill before the House of Representatives in the nation and the executive branch and

747
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,880
 the Ministry of Defense for the declassification of these documents.

748
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,800
 Obviously, this is being supported by other civilian groups.

749
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:08,080
 There are many, many particularly young people who are following these investigations, young

750
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:15,120
 people with a lot of energy, and who have united behind the declassification of this.

751
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:21,220
 You can see Argentina is part of South America.

752
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:28,640
 We've had some very interesting cases that have been striking internationally.

753
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:34,620
 Many investigators, as I noted before, Jaime and some of the other international investigators,

754
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:43,480
 we believe that some of these cases, these rich cases that are very strange but there

755
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:49,160
 have been reliable sightings, could bring new elements to the fore.

756
01:17:49,160 --> 01:18:00,620
 I remember Dr. Hynek always told me that perhaps we'll never know about this phenomenon fully

757
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:08,780
 in our lifetimes, but it's worth the sacrifice and energy we are investing in our investigations.

758
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:15,920
 Our work, our task, is to compile information so that scientists in the future may be able

759
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,000
 to shed some light on this phenomenon.

760
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:27,560
 And in conclusion, with regard to official investigations, over the last 40 years, military

761
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:38,340
 entities have studied UFOs with scientific care to separate misinterpretations, natural

762
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:43,000
 misinterpretations, and the difference between science and nature.

763
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,240
 Things that cannot be explained.

764
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:50,840
 The position of these agencies has not changed much since the 1960s up till now.

765
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,900
 And I am a living witness to this.

766
01:18:53,900 --> 01:19:01,400
 I have spent the past 36 years investigating these UFO phenomena, not just in Argentina

767
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,760
 but in Latin America and the world as a whole.

768
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:13,400
 But we continue to believe that our elegant universe, it warrants the benefit of the doubt

769
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:21,400
 that this phenomenon may or may not be extraterrestrial, but we still need more proof.

770
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:26,400
 Reading between the lines, we know that many of these official organizations, they don't

771
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:34,560
 say it or write it, but they believe that the phenomenon could, in fact, be extraterrestrial.

772
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:40,120
 The Argentinian Armed Forces and their scientific commissions have never openly declared that

773
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:49,060
 the phenomenon might be extraterrestrial, but rather they let people read between the

774
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,060
 lines.

775
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:50,800
 Thank you very much.

776
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:58,040
 [ Applause ]

777
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,880
 >> Thank you very much, and I want to thank all of you.

778
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:06,840
 We're going to take a short break, and then we will come back and have questions.

779
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:10,540
 So what do you think, 15 minutes?

780
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:14,600
 15 minutes, so if we can be back at a quarter to 11, that would be perfect.

781
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,100
 Thank you.
